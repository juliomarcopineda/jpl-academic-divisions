Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities-Optimized Stroke Minimization. II. Optimization for Future Missions	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: detection; stars: imaging	CONTRAST IMAGING-SYSTEMS; EXTREME ADAPTIVE OPTICS; GEMINI PLANET IMAGER; 2 DEFORMABLE MIRRORS; 51 ERI B; TELESCOPE APERTURES; CORONAGRAPH; ABERRATIONS; PRINCIPLE; EXOPLANET	High-contrast imaging and spectroscopy provide unique constraints for exoplanet formation models as well as for planetary atmosphere models. Instrumentation techniques in this field have greatly improved over the last two decades, with the development of stellar coronagraphy, in parallel with specific methods of wavefront sensing and control. Next generation space-and ground-based telescopes will enable the characterization of cold solar-system-like planets for the first time and maybe even in situ detection of bio-markers. However, the growth of primary mirror diameters, necessary for these detections, comes with an increase of their complexity (segmentation, secondary mirror features). These discontinuities in the aperture can greatly limit the performance of coronagraphic instruments. In this context, we introduced a new technique, Active Correction of Aperture Discontinuities-Optimized Stroke Minimization (ACAD-OSM), to correct for the diffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph, using deformable mirrors. In this paper, we present several tools that can be used to optimize the performance of this technique for its application to future large missions. In particular, we analyzed the influence of the deformable setup (size and separating distance) and found that there is an optimal point for this setup, optimizing the performance of the instrument in contrast and throughput while minimizing the strokes applied to the deformable mirrors. These results will help us design future coronagraphic instruments to obtain the best performance.

The Impact of Airborne Radio Occultation Observations on the Simulation of Hurricane Karl (2010)	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM; FULL SPECTRUM INVERSION; GENESIS POTENTIAL INDEX; SATELLITE RADIANCE DATA; TROPICAL CYCLONES; RAPID INTENSIFICATION; OBSERVATION OPERATOR; REFRACTIVE-INDEX; FORECAST IMPACT; ATMOSPHERE	This study evaluates, for the first time, the impact of airborne global positioning system radio occultation (ARO) observations on a hurricane forecast. A case study was conducted of Hurricane Karl during the PreDepression Investigation of Cloud-Systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign in 2010. The assimilation of ARO data was developed for the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) analysis system of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 3.2. The impact of ARO data on Karl forecasts was evaluated through data assimilation (DA) experiments of local refractivity and nonlocal excess phase (EPH), in which the latter accounts for the integrated horizontal sampling along the signal ray path. The tangent point positions (closest point of an RO ray path to Earth's surface) drift horizontally, and the drifting distance of ARO data is about 2 to 3 times that of spaceborne RO, which was taken into account in these simulations. Results indicate that in the absence of other satellite observations, the assimilation of ARO EPH resulted in a larger impact on the analysis than local refractivity did. In particular, the assimilation of ARO observations at the actual tangent point locations resulted in more accurate forecasts of the rapid intensification of the storm. Among all experiments, the best forecast was obtained by assimilating ARO data with the most accurate geometric representation, that is, the use of nonlocal EPH operators with tangent point drift, which reduced the error in the storm's predicted minimum sea level pressure (SLP) by 43% beyond that of the control experiment.

Estimation of Precipitation over the OLYMPEX Domain during Winter 2015/16	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; RAIN-GAUGE; CLIMATOLOGICAL PRECIPITATION; OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; PASSIVE MICROWAVE; SATELLITE; RADAR; TEMPERATURE; GSMAP	To provide ground validation data for satellite precipitation products derived from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, such as IMERG, in cold seasons and where orographic factors exert strong controls on precipitation, the Olympic Mountain Experiment (OLYMPEX) was conducted during winter 2015/16. By utilizing multiple observational resources from OLYMPEX, estimates of daily and finer-scale precipitation are constructed at 1/328 spatial resolution over the OLYMPEX domain. The estimates are based on NOAA WSR-88D and gauge estimates as incorporated in NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) Q3GC product, augmented with an additional 120 gauges available during OLYMPEX. Few stations are located in the interior of the Olympic Peninsula at elevations higher than about 500 m, and in this part of the domain the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model is used to invert the snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates, derived from two NASA JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow depth maps on 8-9 February 2016 and 29-30 March 2016, for precipitation through adjustment of the precipitation-weighting factor on a grid cell by grid cell basis. In comparison with this composite product, both IMERG (version 04A) and its Japanese counterpart GSMaP's (version 04B) satellite-only products tend to underestimate winter precipitation, by 41% and 28%, respectively, over the entire domain from 1 October 2015 to 30 April 2016. The underestimation is more pronounced for the orographically enhanced mountainous interior of the OLYMPEX domain, by 57% and 48%, respectively. In contrast, IMERG and GSMaP storm interarrival time statistics are quite similar to those estimated from gridded observations.

Velocity is measured by the Doppler shift of dual X- and Ka-band radio links between the Juno spacecraft, in orbit around Jupiter, and the DSS-25 antenna of the Deep Space Network (DSN). During times of closest-approach, Juno experiences large dynamic ranges caused by the orbital dynamics and spin signatures caused by the spin-stabilized spacecraft that are detectable by the receivers at DSS-25. Open-loop recordings of received voltages are processed to compute Doppler observables utilized in the estimation of the gravity field. Presented is a method to process open-loop data collected by the DSN to compensate for the spin signature of the spacecraft, removal of artifacts from Doppler observables caused by the high dynamic environment, and improve performance of the digital phase-locked loop utilized in the data processing.

Invented at Caltech/JPL, recent laboratory demonstrations have resulted in near quantum-limited noise performance over more than an octave of microwave bandwidth and operating temperatures as high as 3 Kelvin. These amplifiers have the potential to be used as front-end replacements for ALMA's mm/sub-mm SIS receivers and intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers, and for multiplexing faint signals from focal-plane arrays of single-photon detectors on space telescopes such as NASA's Origins Space Telescope (OST). The enhanced observational capabilities that would be enabled by TKIP front-end amplifiers on ALMA would tremendously benefit ALMA science across all bands.

In a 1 km pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean simulation, the small-scale sea ice deformations are evaluated with a scaling analysis in relation to satellite observations of the Envisat Geophysical Processor System (EGPS) in the Central Arctic. A new coupled scaling analysis for data on Eulerian grids is used to determine the spatial and temporal scaling and the coupling between temporal and spatial scales. The spatial scaling of the modeled sea ice deformation implies multifractality. It is also coupled to temporal scales and varies realistically by region and season. The agreement of the spatial scaling with satellite observations challenges previous results with VP models at coarser resolution, which did not reproduce the observed scaling. The temporal scaling analysis shows that the VP model, as configured in this 1 km simulation, does not fully resolve the intermittency of sea ice deformation that is observed in satellite data.

Relationships between ECS and observable metrics of the current climate in model ensembles, so-called emergent constraints, have been used to constrain ECS. Here a statistical method (including a backward selection process) is employed to achieve a better statistical understanding of the connections between four recently proposed emergent constraint metrics and individual feedbacks influencing ECS. The relationship between each metric and ECS is largely attributable to a statistical connection with shortwave low cloud feedback, the leading cause of intermodel ECS spread. This result bolsters confidence in some of the metrics, which had assumed such a connection in the first place. Additional analysis is conducted with a few thousand artificial metrics that are randomly generated but are well correlated with ECS. The relationships between the contrived metrics and ECS can also be linked statistically to shortwave cloud feedback. Thus, any proposed or forthcoming ECS constraint based on the current generation of climate models should be viewed as a potential constraint on shortwave cloud feedback, and physical links with that feedback should be investigated to verify that the constraint is real. In addition, any proposed ECS constraint should not be taken at face value since other factors influencing ECS besides shortwave cloud feedback could be systematically biased in the models.

Detecting Upward Directed Charged Particle Fluxes in the Mars Science Laboratory Radiation Assessment Detector	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; GCR; MSL; RAD; particle flux directionality	PROTONS; RAD	The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, operating on the surface of Mars, is exposed to radiation fluxes from above and below. Galactic Cosmic Rays travel through the Martian atmosphere, producing a modified spectrum consisting of both primary and secondary particles at ground level. These particles produce an upward directed secondary particle spectrum as they interact with the Martian soil. Here we develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward directed particle fluxes in the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of Geant4 and Planetocosmics modeling to find discrimination criteria for the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare model-predicted values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in RAD observation data. Given the quality of available information on Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and rover composition, we find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. We additionally note that the method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies. Plain Language Summary The MSL rover Curiosity is exposed to energetic particles from above and below on the Martian surface. Particles enter the Martian atmosphere from above and travel through it until they reach the ground. Particles lose energy and can produce secondary particles while passing through the atmosphere, resulting in an energy distribution on ground level that is different from that on the top of the atmosphere. The resulting particles produce an upward directed particle distribution in the soil. We develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward particle fluxes in the RAD instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of models to find criteria for discriminating the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare simulated values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in observation data. We find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. The method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies.	[Appel, J. K.; Koeehler, J.; Guo, J.; Lohf, H.; Wimmer-Schweingruber, R.

Complex Plane Specular Meteor Radar Interferometry	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						radar; phased array; interferometry; uncertainty; specular; meteor	MESOSPHERIC WINDS; CALIBRATION	This paper presents a solution to the problem of specular meteor radar interferometry cast on the complex plane. This technique is applicable to all meteor radars at the output of the receiver's pulsed Doppler signal processing chain. Specular meteor trail radar echoes are modeled as exponentially decaying sinusoids impinging on a sparse interferometric antenna array. A set of 10 underdense meteor trail radar parameters are estimated using nonlinear least squares optimization of the physical model parameters. Meteor trail spatial locations are determined by estimating all parameters through global optimization of the complex-valued interferometric angle-of-arrival equations. Statistical precision of the estimated meteor radar parameters of Doppler, diffusion coefficient, angle-of-arrival, and height are subsequently characterized by calculation of the full covariance matrix. The determination of statistical uncertainties in the measured parameters is a key innovation in the field, as it lays the groundwork for calculating the statistical precision of the subsequently derived wind field.

New Separators in Lithium/Sulfur Cells with High-Capacity Cathodes	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Li-SM3 Conference	APR 26-27, 2017	London, ENGLAND				LI-S; POLYSULFIDE SHUTTLE; SULFUR BATTERIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ENERGY DENSITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE CATHODES; CARBON; ELECTRODE; CHEMISTRY	Lithium-sulfur cells exhibit poor cycle life, due to the 'polysulfide shuttle' enabled by the dissolution of sulfur reduction products in organic electrolyte. Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, including novel cathode designs to sequester polysulfides within the cathode, new electrolytes with reduced polysulfide solubility, and blocking layers to hinder polysulfide migration towards the anode. However, these are less successful in the case of high-energy Li/S cells with cathodes featuring substantial sulfur loadings, as proportionately greater polysulfide dissolution rapidly degrades performance. Additionally, the electrolyte/sulfur ratio is a limiting factor in high-energy cells, indicating that a minimum polysulfide solubility is required. Herein we describe the benefits of modified separators with the objective of blocking polysulfide migration. Specifically, we demonstrate improved discharge performance in laboratory Li/S cells with ceramic-coated separators, including single-sided and double-sided Al2O3-coated polyolefin material from commercial sources. We also developed a new AlF3 coating on a polyolefin separator that showed even greater improvements: higher initial specific capacity (similar to 800 mAh/gS), coulombic efficiency (>96%), and cycle life (>100 cycles). Detailed analytical study via SEM and EDS of separators harvested from cycled cells indicated an approximately uniform sulfur distribution across the ceramic-coated separator. Finally, concentrated electrolytes, which reportedly minimize polysulfide diffusion and lithium dendrite growth, were tested and shown to yield high coulombic efficiency although with low sulfur utilization.

Past, targeted investments in specific climate questions have resulted in tremendous improvements in issues important to human health, security, and infrastructure. However, the current climate observing system was not planned in a comprehensive, focused manner required to adequately address the full range of climate needs. A potential approach to planning the observing system of the future is presented in this article. First, this article proposes that priority be given to the most critical needs as identified within the World Climate Research Program as Grand Challenges. These currently include seven important topics: melting ice and global consequences; clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity; carbon feedbacks in the climate system; understanding and predicting weather and climate extremes; water for the food baskets of the world; regional sea-level change and coastal impacts; and near-term climate prediction. For each Grand Challenge, observations are needed for long-term monitoring, process studies and forecasting capabilities. Second, objective evaluations of proposed observing systems, including satellites, ground-based and in situ observations as well as potentially new, unidentified observational approaches, can quantify the ability to address these climate priorities. And third, investments in effective climate observations will be economically important as they will offer a magnified return on investment that justifies a far greater development of observations to serve society's needs.

Enabling interoperability in planetary sciences and heliophysics: The case for an information model	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union		Interoperability; Information architecture; Information model; Planetary science; Heliophysics; Semantic; Digital repository; Ontology		The Planetary Data System has developed the PDS4 Information Model to enable interoperability across diverse science disciplines. The Information Model is based on an integration of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) level standards for trusted digital archives, information model development, and metadata registries. Where controlled vocabularies provides a basic level of interoperability by providing a common set of terms for communication between both machines and humans the Information Model improves interoperability by means of an ontology that provides semantic information or additional related context for the terms. The information model was defined by team of computer scientists and science experts from each of the diverse disciplines in the Planetary Science community, including Atmospheres, Geosciences, Cartography and Imaging Sciences, Navigational and Ancillary Information, Planetary Plasma Interactions, Ring-Moon Systems, and Small Bodies. The model was designed to be extensible beyond the Planetary Science community, for example there are overlaps between certain PDS disciplines and the Heliophysics and Astrophysics disciplines. "Interoperability" can apply to many aspects of both the developer and the end-user experience, for example agency-to-agency, semantic level, and application level interoperability. We define these types of interoperability and focus on semantic level interoperability, the type of interoperability most directly enabled by an information model.	[Hughes, J.

The survey has been awarded 300 nights of observing time at the Subaru Telescope, and it started in 2014 March. This paper presents the first public data release of HSC-SSP. This release includes data taken in the first 1.7 yr of observations (61.5 nights), and each of the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep layers covers about 108, 26, and 4 square degrees down to depths of i similar to 26.4, similar to 26.5, and similar to 27.0 mag, respectively (5 sigma for point sources). All the layers are observed in five broad bands (grizy), and the Deep and UltraDeep layers are observed in narrow bands as well. We achieve an impressive image quality of 0.'' 6 in the i band in the Wide layer. We show that we achieve 1%-2% point spread function (PSF) photometry (root mean square) both internally and externally (against Pan-STARRS1), and similar to 10 mas and 40 mas internal and external astrometric accuracy, respectively. Both the calibrated images and catalogs are made available to the community through dedicated user interfaces and database servers.

A team of scientists from Japan, Taiwan, and Princeton University is using HSC to carry out a 300-night multi-band imaging survey of the high-latitude sky. The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg(2) in five broad bands (grizy), with a 5 sigma point-source depth of r approximate to 26. The Deep layer covers a total of 26 deg(2) in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg(2)). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing. This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, which includes a large number of technical and scientific papers describing results from the early phases of this survey.

The system was commissioned in 2012-2014, and has been offered for general observations, including the HSC Subaru Strategic Program, since 2014 March. The system provides observers with data quality information, such as seeing, sky background level, and sky transparency, based on quick analysis as data are acquired. Quick-look images and validation of image focus are also provided through an interactive web application. The system is responsible for the automatic extraction of QA information from acquired raw data into a database, to assist with observation planning, assess progress of all observing programs, and monitor long-term efficiency variations of the instrument and telescope. Enhancements of the system are being planned to facilitate final data analysis, to improve the HSC archive, and to provide legacy products for astronomical communities.

On the 1.degrees 5 diameter focal plane (497 mm in physical size), 116 four-side buttable 2k x 4 k fully depleted CCDs are tiled with 0.3 mm gaps between adjacent chips, which are cooled down to -100.degrees C by two pulse tube coolers with a capability to exhaust 100 W heat at -100.degrees C. The design of the dewar is basically a natural extension of Suprime-Cam, incorporating some improvements such as (1) a detailed CCD positioning strategy to avoid any collision between CCDs while maximizing the filling factor of the focal plane, (2) a spherical washers mechanism adopted for the interface points to avoid any deformation caused by the tilt of the interface surface to be transferred to the focal plane, (3) the employment of a truncated-cone-shaped window, made of synthetic silica, to save the back focal space, and (4) a passive heat transfer mechanism to exhaust efficiently the heat generated from the CCD readout electronics which are accommodated inside the dewar. Extensive simulations using a finite-element analysis (FEA) method are carried out to verify that the design of the dewar is sufficient to satisfy the assigned errors. We also perform verification tests using the actually assembled CCD dewar to supplement the FEA and demonstrate that the design is adequate to ensure an excellent image quality which is key to the HSC. The details of the camera system, including the control computer system, are described as well as the assembling process of the dewar and the process of installation on the telescope.

The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg(2) split into six fields, with a mean i-band seeing of 0".58 and 5 sigma point-source depth of i similar to 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for first-year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin(-2), respectively. We define the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We find that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lensing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function rho(1) < 3 x 10(-7) (requirement: 4 x 10(-7)) at 0 degrees.5 scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on > 1 degrees scales that are sufficiently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.

As a pilot study for a series of papers, we measure hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) masses using XMM-Newton data for four clusters in the current coverage area out of a sample of 22 MCXC clusters. We additionally analyze a non-MCXC cluster associated with one MCXC cluster. We show that HE masses for the MCXC clusters are correlated with cluster richness from the CAMIRA catalog, while that for the non-MCXC cluster deviates from the scaling relation. The mass normalization of the relationship between cluster richness and HE mass is compatible with one inferred by matching CAMIRA cluster abundance with a theoretical halo mass function. The mean gas mass fraction based on HE masses for the MCXC clusters is < f(gas)> = 0.125 +/- 0.012 at spherical overdensity Delta = 500, which is similar to 80%-90% of the cosmic mean baryon fraction, Omega(b)/Omega(m), measured by cosmic microwave background experiments. We find that the mean baryon fraction estimated from X-ray and HSC-SSP optical data is comparable to Omega(b)/Omega(m). A weak-lensing shear catalog of background galaxies, combined with photometric redshifts, is currently available only for three clusters in our sample. Hydrostatic equilibrium masses roughly agree with weak-lensingmasses, albeit with large uncertainty. This study demonstrates that further multiwavelength study for a large sample of clusters using X-ray, HSC-SSP optical, and weak-lensing data will enable us to understand cluster physics and utilize cluster-based cosmology.

HSC is a new prime focus optical imager with a 1.(omicron)5-diameter field of view on the 8.2 m Subaru telescope. The superb median seeing on the HSC i-band images of 0 ''.56 allows the reconstruction of high angular resolution mass maps via weak lensing, which is crucial for the weak lensing cluster search. We identify 65 mass map peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio larger than 4.7, and carefully examine their properties by cross-matching the clusters with optical and X-ray cluster catalogs. We find that all the 39 peaks with S/N > 5.1 have counterparts in the optical cluster catalogs, and only 2 out of the 65 peaks are probably false positives. The upper limits of X-ray luminosities from the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS) imply the existence of an X-ray underluminous cluster population. We show that the X-rays from the shear-selected clusters can be statistically detected by stacking the RASS images. The inferred average X-ray luminosity is about half that of the X-ray-selected clusters of the same mass. The radial profile of the dark matter distribution derived from the stacking analysis is well modeled by the Navarro-Frenk-White profile with a small concentration parameter value of c(500) similar to 2.5, which suggests that the selection bias on the orientation or the internal structure for our shear-selected cluster sample is not strong.

II. Faint end color-magnitude diagrams and radial profiles of red and blue galaxies at 0.1 < z < 1.1	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: dark matter	MORPHOLOGY-DENSITY RELATION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; STELLAR MASS; DATA RELEASE; HALO MASSES; SEQUENCE; EVOLUTION; ENVIRONMENT; FRACTIONS	We present a statistical study of the redshift evolution of the cluster galaxy population over a wide redshift range from 0.1 to 1.1, using similar to 1900 optically-selected CAMIRA clusters from similar to 232 deg(2) of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Wide S16A data. Our stacking technique with a statistical background subtraction reveals color-magnitude diagrams of red-sequence and blue cluster galaxies down to faint magnitudes of m(z) similar to 24. We find that the linear relation of red-sequence galaxies in the color-magnitude diagram extends down to the faintest magnitudes we explore with a small intrinsic scatter sigma(int)(g - r) < 0.1. The scatter does not evolve significantly with redshift. The stacked color-magnitude diagrams are used to define red and blue galaxies in clusters in order to study their radial number density profiles without resorting to photometric redshifts of individual galaxies. We find that red galaxies are significantly more concentrated toward cluster centers and blue galaxies dominate the outskirts of clusters. We explore the fraction of red galaxies in clusters as a function of redshift, and find that the red fraction decreases with increasing distances from cluster centers. The red fraction exhibits a moderate decrease with increasing redshift. The radial number density profiles of cluster member galaxies are also used to infer the location of the steepest slope in the three-dimensional galaxy density profiles. For a fixed threshold in richness, we find little redshift evolution in this location.

We compare these weak lensing based dark matter maps with maps of the distribution of the stellar mass associated with luminous red galaxies. We find a strong correlation between these two maps with a correlation coefficient of rho = 0.54 +/- 0.03 (for a smoothing size of 8'). This correlation is detected even with a smaller smoothing scale of 2' (rho = 0.34 +/- 0.01). This detection is made uniquely possible because of the high source density of the HSC-SSP weak lensing survey ((n) over bar similar to 25 arcmin(-2)). We also present a variety of tests to demonstrate that our maps are not significantly affected by systematic effects. By using the photometric redshift information associated with source galaxies, we reconstruct a three-dimensional mass map. This three-dimensional mass map is also found to correlate with the three-dimensional galaxy mass map. Cross-correlation tests presented in this paper demonstrate that the HSC-SSP weak lensing mass maps are ready for further science analyses.

The HSC images are sufficiently deep to detect cluster member galaxies down to M-* similar to 10(10.2) M-circle dot even at z similar to 1, allowing a reliable cluster detection at such high redshifts. We apply the CAMIRA algorithm to the HSC Wide S16A dataset covering similar to 232 deg(2) to construct a catalog of 1921 clusters at redshift 0.1 < z < 1.1 and richness (N) over cap (mem) > 15 that roughly corresponds to M-200m greater than or similar to 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot. We confirm good cluster photometric redshift performance, with the bias and the scatter in Delta z/(1 + z) being better than 0.005 and 0.01, respectively, over most of the redshift range. We compare our cluster catalog with large X-ray cluster catalogs from the XXL and XMM-LSS (the XMM Large Scale Structure) surveys and find good correlation between richness and X-ray properties. We also study the mis-centering effect from the distribution of offsets between optical and X-ray cluster centers. We confirm the high (> 0.9) completeness and purity for high-mass clusters by analyzing mock galaxy catalogs.

The mission objectives are primarily the observation of the oceanic mesoscales but also include coastal oceanography, global and regional sea level monitoring, data assimilation, and operational oceanography. The mission ended its nominal phase after 3 years in orbit and began a new phase (drifting orbit) in July 2016. The objective of this paper is to provide a state of the art of the achievements of the SARAL/AltiKa mission in terms of quality assessment and unique characteristics of AltiKa data. It shows that the AltiKa data have similar accuracy at the centimeter level in term of absolute water level whatever the method (from local to global) and the type of water surfaces (ocean and lakes). It shows also that beyond the fact that AltiKa data quality meets the expectations and initial mission requirements, the unique characteristics of the altimeter and the Ka-band offer unique contributions in fields that were previously not fully foreseen.

Downscaling GRACE Remote Sensing Datasets to High-Resolution Groundwater Storage Change Maps of California's Central Valley	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GRACE; downscaling; groundwater; neural networks; California's Central Valley; water resources management	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CIRCULATION MODEL OUTPUT; AQUIFER SYSTEM; WATER; SIMULATION; DEPLETION; PRECIPITATION; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; REGIONS	NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has already proven to be a powerful data source for regional groundwater assessments in many areas around the world. However, the applicability of GRACE data products to more localized studies and their utility to water management authorities have been constrained by their limited spatial resolution (similar to 200,000 km(2)). Researchers have begun to address these shortcomings with data assimilation approaches that integrate GRACE-derived total water storage estimates into complex regional models, producing higher-resolution estimates of hydrologic variables (similar to 2500 km(2)). Here we take those approaches one step further by developing an empirically based model capable of downscaling GRACE data to a high-resolution (similar to 16 km(2)) dataset of groundwater storage changes over a portion of California's Central Valley. The model utilizes an artificial neural network to generate a series of high-resolution maps of groundwater storage change from 2002 to 2010 using GRACE estimates of variations in total water storage and a series of widely available hydrologic variables (PRISM precipitation and temperature data, digital elevation model (DEM)-derived slope, and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil type). The neural network downscaling model is able to accurately reproduce local groundwater behavior, with acceptable Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values for calibration and validation (ranging from 0.2445 to 0.9577 and 0.0391 to 0.7511, respectively). Ultimately, the model generates maps of local groundwater storage change at a 100-fold higher resolution than GRACE gridded data products without the use of computationally intensive physical models. The model's simulated maps have the potential for application to local groundwater management initiatives in the region.

Numerous processing approaches have been developed to improve InSAR results and overcome its limitations. Regardless of the processing methodology, however, temporal decorrelation is a major obstacle for all InSAR applications, especially over vegetated areas and dynamic environments, such as Interior Alaska. Temporal coherence is usually modeled as a univariate exponential function of temporal baseline. It has been, however, documented that temporal variations in surface backscattering due to the change in surface parameters, i.e., dielectric constant, roughness, and the geometry of scatterers, can result in gradual, seasonal, or sudden decorrelations and loss of InSAR coherence. The coherence models introduced so far have largely neglected the effect of the temporal change in backscattering on InSAR coherence. Here, we introduce a new temporal decorrelation model that considers changes in surface backscattering by utilizing the relative change in SAR intensity between two images as a proxy for the change in surface scattering parameters. The model also takes into account the decorrelation due to the change in snow depth between two images. Using the L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) data, the model has been assessed over forested and shrub landscapes in Delta Junction, Interior Alaska. The model decreases the RMS error of temporal coherence estimation from 0.18 to 0.09 on average. The improvements made by the model have been statistically proved to be significant at the 99% confidence level. Additionally, the model shows that the coherence of forested areas are more prone to changes in backscattering than shrub landscape. The model is based on L-band data and may not be expanded to C-band or X-band InSAR observations.

Estimating Live Fuel Moisture from MODIS Satellite Data for Wildfire Danger Assessment in Southern California USA	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						wildfire; satellite vegetation indices; live fuel moisture; empirical model function; Southern California; chaparral ecosystem	TIME-SERIES; VEGETATION; DEGRADATION; IMPACT; NDVI	The goal of the research reported here is to assess the capability of satellite vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard both Terra and Aqua satellites, in order to replicate live fuel moisture content of Southern California chaparral ecosystems. We compared seasonal and interannual characteristics of in-situ live fuel moisture with satellite vegetation indices that were averaged over different radial extents around each live fuel moisture observation site. The highest correlations are found using the Aqua Enhanced Vegetation Index for a radius of 10 km, independently verifying the validity of in-situ live fuel moisture measurements over a large extent around each in-situ site. With this optimally averaged Enhanced Vegetation Index, we developed an empirical model function of live fuel moisture. Trends in the wet-to-dry phase of vegetation are well captured by the empirical model function on interannual time-scales, indicating a promising method to monitor fire danger levels by combining satellite, in-situ, and model results during the transition before active fire seasons. An example map of Enhanced Vegetation Index-derived live fuel moisture for the Colby Fire shows a complex spatial pattern of significant live fuel moisture reduction along an extensive wildland-urban interface, and illustrates a key advantage in using satellites across the large extent of wildland areas in Southern California.

Reservoirs act as critical buffers to ensure agricultural and municipal water deliveries, mitigate flooding, and generate hydroelectric power, yet they often lose significant amounts of water through evaporation, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Despite this fact, reservoir evaporation has been an inconsistently and inaccurately estimated component of the water cycle within the water resource infrastructure of the arid and semiarid western United States. This paper highlights the increasing importance and challenges of correctly estimating and forecasting reservoir evaporation in the current and future climate, as well as the need to bring new ideas and state-of-the-art practices for the estimation of reservoir evaporation into operational use for modern water resource managers. New ideas and practices include i) improving the estimation of reservoir evaporation using up-to-date knowledge, state-of-the-art instrumentation and numerical models, and innovative experimental designs to diagnose processes and accurately forecast evaporation; ii) improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in evaporative water loss from existing reservoirs and transferring this knowledge when expanding reservoirs or siting new ones; and iii) implementing an adaptive management plan that incorporates new knowledge, observations, and forecasts of reservoir evaporation to improve water resource management.

J	Izard, A; Fosalba, P; Crocce, M				Izard, Albert; Fosalba, Pablo; Crocce, Martin			ICE-COLA: fast simulations for weak lensing observables	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; dark matter; large-scale structure of Universe	MATTER POWER SPECTRUM; LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; MOCK GALAXY CATALOGS; DARK-MATTER; COVARIANCE-MATRIX; PERTURBATION-THEORY; FAST GENERATION; HALO CATALOGS; ACCURATE	Approximate methods to full N-body simulations provide a fast and accurate solution to the development of mock catalogues for the modelling of galaxy clustering observables. In this paper we extend ICE-COLA, based on an optimized implementation of the approximate COLA method, to produce weak lensing maps and halo catalogues in the light-cone using an integrated and self-consistent approach. We show that despite the approximate dynamics, the catalogues thus produced enable an accurate modelling of weak lensing observables one decade beyond the characteristic scale where the growth becomes non-linear. In particular, we compare ICE-COLA to the MICE Grand Challenge N-body simulation for some fiducial cases representative of upcoming surveys and find that, for sources at redshift z = 1, their convergence power spectra agree to within 1 per cent up to high multipoles (i.e. of order 1000). The corresponding shear two point functions, xi+ and. xi-, yield similar accuracy down to 2 and 20 arcmin respectively, while tangential shear around a z = 0.5 lens sample is accurate down to 4 arcmin. We show that such accuracy is stable against an increased angular resolution of the weak lensing maps. Hence, this opens the possibility of using approximate methods for the joint modelling of galaxy clustering and weak lensing observables and their covariance in ongoing and future galaxy surveys.

J	Friedrich, O; Eifler, T				Friedrich, Oliver; Eifler, Tim			Precision matrix expansion - efficient use of numerical simulations in estimating errors on cosmological parameters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: statistical; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE; COVARIANCE-MATRIX; SHRINKAGE ESTIMATION; COSMOLIKE; IMPACT	Computing the inverse covariance matrix (or precision matrix) of large data vectors is crucial in weak lensing (and multiprobe) analyses of the large-scale structure of the Universe. Analytically computed covariances are noise-free and hence straightforward to invert; however, the model approximations might be insufficient for the statistical precision of future cosmological data. Estimating covariances from numerical simulations improves on these approximations, but the sample covariance estimator is inherently noisy, which introduces uncertainties in the error bars on cosmological parameters and also additional scatter in their best-fitting values. For future surveys, reducing both effects to an acceptable level requires an unfeasibly large number of simulations. In this paper we describe a way to expand the precision matrix around a covariance model and show how to estimate the leading order terms of this expansion from simulations. This is especially powerful if the covariance matrix is the sum of two contributions, C = A + B, where A is well understood analytically and can be turned off in simulations (e.g. shape noise for cosmic shear) to yield a direct estimate of B. We test our method in mock experiments resembling tomographic weak lensing data vectors from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). For DES we find that 400 N-body simulations are sufficient to achieve negligible statistical uncertainties on parameter constraints. For LSST this is achieved with 2400 simulations. The standard covariance estimator would require > 10(5) simulations to reach a similar precision. We extend our analysis to a DES multiprobe case finding a similar performance.

Simulation-based marginal likelihood for cluster strong lensing cosmology	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: numerical; methods: statistical; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: theory	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; GALACTIC NUCLEI FEEDBACK; DARK-MATTER HALOES; APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; X-RAY; GALAXY CLUSTERS; ARC STATISTICS; AGN FEEDBACK; SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH; MILLENNIUM SIMULATION	Comparisons between observed and predicted strong lensing properties of galaxy clusters have been routinely used to claim either tension or consistency with Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. However, standard approaches to such cosmological tests are unable to quantify the preference for one cosmology over another. We advocate approximating the relevant Bayes factor using a marginal likelihood that is based on the following summary statistic: the posterior probability distribution function for the parameters of the scaling relation between Einstein radii and cluster mass, alpha and beta. We demonstrate, for the first time, a method of estimating the marginal likelihood using the X-ray selected z > 0.5 Massive Cluster Survey clusters as a case in point and employing both N-body and hydrodynamic simulations of clusters. We investigate the uncertainty in this estimate and consequential ability to compare competing cosmologies, which arises from incomplete descriptions of baryonic processes, discrepancies in cluster selection criteria, redshift distribution and dynamical state. The relation between triaxial cluster masses at various overdensities provides a promising alternative to the strong lensing test.

NuSTAR plus XMM-Newton monitoring of the neutron star transient AX J1745.6-2901	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; methods: observational; techniques: spectroscopic; stars: neutron; absorption lines; X-rays: binaries	X-RAY BINARIES; ACCRETING BLACK-HOLES; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; BROAD IRON LINES; FE K ABSORPTION; GALACTIC-CENTER; LOW/HARD STATE; GX 339-4; V404 CYGNI; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM	AX J1745.6-2901 is a high-inclination (eclipsing) transient neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary showcasing intense ionized Fe K absorption. We present here the analysis of 11 XMM-Newton and 15 NuSTAR new data sets (obtained between 2013 and 2016), therefore tripling the number of observations of AX J1745.6-2901 in outburst. Thanks to simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra, we greatly improve on the fitting of the X-ray continuum. During the soft state, the emission can be described by a disc blackbody (kT similar to 1.1-1.2 keV and inner disc radius r(DBB) similar to 14 km), plus hot (kT similar to 2.2-3.0 keV) blackbody radiation with a small emitting radius (r(BB) similar to 0.5-0.8 km) likely associated with the boundary layer or NS surface, plus a faint Comptonization component. Imprinted on the spectra are clear absorption features created by both neutral and ionized matter. Additionally, positive residuals suggestive of an emission Fe K alpha disc line and consistent with relativistic ionized reflection are present during the soft state, while such residuals are not significant during the hard state. The hard-state spectra are characterized by a hard (Gamma similar to 1.9-2.1) power law, showing no evidence for a high energy cut-off (kT(e) > 60-140 keV) and implying a small optical depth (tau < 1.6). The new observations confirm the previously witnessed trend of exhibiting strong Fe K absorption in the soft state that significantly weakens during the hard state.

Subsurface iceberg melt key to Greenland fjord freshwater budget	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							ICE-SHEET; SUBMARINE MELT; SURFACE ELEVATION; GLACIAL FJORD; OCEAN; MELTWATER; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; MODEL; VARIABILITY	Liquid freshwater fluxes from the Greenland ice sheet affect ocean water properties and circulation on local, regional and basin-wide scales, with associated biosphere effects. The exact impact, however, depends on the volume, timing and location of freshwater releases, which are poorly known. In particular, the transformation of icebergs, which make up roughly 30-50% of the loss of the ice-sheet mass to liquid freshwater, is not well understood. Here we estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of the freshwater flux for the Helheim-Sermilikg lacier-fjord system in southeast Greenland using an iceberg-melt model that resolves the subsurface iceberg melt. By estimating seasonal variations in all the freshwater sources, we confirm quantitatively that iceberg melt is the largest annual freshwater source in this system type. We also show that 68-78% of the iceberg melt is released below a depth of 20 m and, seasonally, about 40-100% of that melt is likely to remain at depth, in contrast with the usual model assumptions. Iceberg melt also peaks two months after all the other freshwater sources peak. Our methods provide a framework to assess individual freshwater sources in any tidewater system, and our results are particularly applicable to coastal regions with a high solid-ice discharge in Greenland.

Evapotranspiration sensitivity to air temperature across a snow-influenced watershed: Space-for-time substitution versus integrated watershed modeling	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Evapotranspiration; Air temperature; Snow; Integrated watershed model; Space-for-time substitution; Soil properties	SIERRA-NEVADA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SWAT MODEL; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; RIVER-BASIN; CALIFORNIA; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; STORAGE; CALIBRATION	Changes in long-term, montane actual evapotranspiration (ET) in response to climate change could impact future water supplies and forest species composition. For scenarios of atmospheric warming, predicted changes in long-term ET tend to differ between studies using space-for-time substitution (STS) models and integrated watershed models, and the influence of spatially varying factors on these differences is unclear. To examine this, we compared warming-induced (+2 to +6 degrees C) changes in ET simulated by an STS model and an integrated watershed model across zones of elevation, substrate available water capacity, and slope in the snow-influenced upper San Joaquin River watershed, Sierra Nevada, USA. We used the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the watershed modeling and a Budyko-type relationship for the STS modeling. Spatially averaged increases in ET from the STS model increasingly surpassed those from the SWAT model in the higher elevation zones of the watershed, resulting in 2.3-2.6 times greater values from the STS model at the watershed scale. In sparse, deep colluvium or glacial soils on gentle slopes, the SWAT model produced ET increases exceeding those from the STS model. However, watershed areas associated with these conditions were too localized for SWAT to produce spatially averaged ET-gains comparable to the STS model. The SWAT model results nevertheless demonstrate that such soils on high-elevation, gentle slopes will form ET "hot spots" exhibiting disproportionately large increases in ET, and concomitant reductions in runoff yield, in response to warming. Predicted ET responses to warming from STS models and integrated watershed models may, in general, substantially differ (e.g., factor of 2-3) for snow-influenced watersheds exhibiting an elevational gradient in substrate water holding capacity and slope. Long-term water supplies in these settings may therefore be more resilient to warming than STS model predictions would suggest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Jepsen, S.

Single photon detection of 1.5 THz radiation with the quantum capacitance detector	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTORS	Far-infrared spectroscopy can reveal secrets of galaxy evolution and heavy-element enrichment throughout cosmic time, prompting astronomers worldwide to design cryogenic space telescopes for far-infrared spectroscopy. The most challenging aspect is a far-infrared detector that is both exquisitely sensitive (limited by the zodiacal-light noise in a narrow wavelength band, lambda/Delta lambda similar to 1,000) and array-able to tens of thousands of pixels. We present the quantum capacitance detector, a superconducting device adapted from quantum computing applications in which photon-produced free electrons in a superconductor tunnel into a small capacitive island embedded in a resonant circuit. The quantum capacitance detector has an optically measured noise equivalent power below 10(-20) W Hz(-1/2) at 1.5 THz, making it the most sensitive far-infrared detector ever demonstrated. We further demonstrate individual far-infrared photon counting, confirming the excellent sensitivity and suitability for cryogenic space astrophysics.	[Echternach, P. M.; Pepper, B.

The analysis is performed on data acquired with an approximately 45-min temporal baseline using the uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar collected in August 2009 over temperate and boreal forests of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec. This investigation presents several compensation methods based on the classical random volume over ground model, which include fixing the value of the extinction parameter, fixing the temporal decorrelation magnitude, or varying temporal decorrelation estimates with height. We also compare results with the random motion over ground model. While these methods have been presented in the literature previously, a comparison of the different methods and an assessment of their height estimation accuracy applied to the same datasets have not yet been performed. In addition, we introduce the use of ancillary reference forest height data from airborne large footprint lidar to estimate model parameters and to mitigate solution ambiguities. We finally demonstrate that this mitigation strategy is robust and suitable for use with future spaceborne lidar missions such as the Global Ecosystems Dynamics Investigation. The resulting PolInSAR canopy height estimates correspond well with those obtained from coincident field and airborne lidar data. Height estimation differences of 3.4 m (RMSE) were observed between the PolInSAR- and lidar-derived canopy height maps when using the fixed extinction method. These can be partially attributed to inherent differences in the sensor spatial resolutions and geolocation accuracy. The RMS error between the PolInSAR height estimates and the field collected Lorey's heights was 2.4 m.

The percentage of bit errors from electron exposure is compared to results from Co-60 total ionizing dose (TID) measurements. Electron irradiation at low energies (below 2 MeV) causes more bit upsets than Co-60 gamma exposures at the same TID level when TID refers to equilibrium dose (as opposed to local dose). Bit upsets increase when electron energy decreases if comparisons are made at the same equilibrium dose level. In particular, 60-MeV electrons are less damaging than Co-60 gamma exposures at the same equilibrium dose level while 1-MeV electrons are more damaging. However, all radiation sources produce virtually identical results when comparisons are made at the same local dose level, indicating that charged-particle equilibrium is violated during electron irradiations.

Separation of detector non-linearity issues and multiple ionization satellites in alpha-particle PIXE	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION B-BEAM INTERACTIONS WITH MATERIALS AND ATOMS			English	Article						Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer; PIXE; XRF; Non-linearity; Multiple ionization satellites	X-RAY SPECTROMETER; SPECTRA; REFINEMENT	Multiple ionization satellites are prominent features in X-ray spectra induced by MeV energy alpha particles. It follows that the accuracy of PIXE analysis using alpha particles can be improved if these features are explicitly incorporated in the peak model description when fitting the spectra with GUPIX or other codes for least-squares fitting PIXE spectra and extracting element concentrations. A method for this incorporation is described and is tested using spectra recorded on Mars by the Curiosity rover's alpha particle X-ray spectrometer. These spectra are induced by both PIXE and X-ray fluorescence, resulting in a spectral energy range from 1 to 25 keV. This range is valuable in determining the energy -channel calibration, which departs from linearity at low X-ray energies. It makes it possible to separate the effects of the satellites from an instrumental non-linearity component. The quality of least-squares spectrum fits is significantly improved, raising the level of confidence in analytical results from alpha-induced PIXE.

Winter precipitation characteristics in western US related to atmospheric river landfalls: observations and model evaluations	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; SURFACE PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SNOW BUDGET; CALIFORNIA; SIMULATION; SEASON; FLOW; SENSITIVITY; PREDICTION	Winter precipitation (PR) characteristics in western United States (WUS) related to atmospheric river (AR) landfalls are examined using the observation-based PRISM data. The observed AR-related precipitation characteristics are in turn used to evaluate model precipitation data from the NASA MERRA2 reanalysis and from seven dynamical downscaling simulations driven by the MERRA2. Multiple metrics including mean bias, Taylor diagram, and two skill scores are used to measure model performance for three climatological sub-regions in WUS, Pacific Northwest (PNW), Pacific Southwest (PSW) and Great Basin (GB). All model data well represent the winter-mean PR with spatial pattern correlations of 0.8 or higher with PRISM for the three sub-regions. Higher spatial resolutions and/or the use of spectral nudging generally yield higher skill scores in simulating the geographical distribution of PR for the entire winter. The PRISM data shows that the AR-related fraction of winter PR and associated daily PR PDFs in each region vary strongly for landfall locations; AR landfalls in the northern WUS coast (NC) affect mostly PNW while those in the southern WUS coast (SC) affect both PSW and GB. NC (SC) landfalls increase the frequency of heavy PR in PNW (PSW and GB) but reduce it in PSW (PNW). All model data reasonably represent these observed variations in the AR-related winter PR fractions and the daily PR PDFs according to AR landfall locations. However, unlike for the entire winter period, no systematic effects of resolution and/or spectral nudging are identified in these AR-related PR characteristics. Dynamical downscaling in this study generally yield positive added values to the MERRA2 PR in the AR-related PR fraction for most sub-regions and landfall locations, most noticeably for PSW by NU-WRF. The downscaling also generate positive added value in p95 for PNW, but negative values for PSW and GB due to overestimation of heavy precipitation events.

Observational estimation of radiative feedback to surface air temperature over Northern High Latitudes	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Local radiative feedback; High-latitude climate feedback; Radiative kernel; Observational estimates of feedback	CLIMATE FEEDBACKS; POLAR AMPLIFICATION; SEA-ICE; KERNEL TECHNIQUE; ALBEDO FEEDBACK; ARCTIC CLIMATE; SENSITIVITY; CLOUDS; VARIABILITY; AQUAPLANET	The high-latitude climate system contains complicated, but largely veiled physical feedback processes. Climate predictions remain uncertain, especially for the Northern High Latitudes (NHL; north of 60 degrees N), and observational constraint on climate modeling is vital. This study estimates local radiative feedbacks for NHL based on the CERES/Terra satellite observations during March 2000-November 2014. The local shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative feedback parameters are calculated from linear regression of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere on surface air temperatures. These parameters are estimated by the de-seasonalization and 12-month moving average of the radiative fluxes over NHL. The estimated magnitudes of the SW and the LW radiative feedbacks in NHL are 1.88 +/- 0.73 and 2.38 +/- 0.59 W m(-2) K-1, respectively. The parameters are further decomposed into individual feedback components associated with surface albedo, water vapor, lapse rate, and clouds, as a product of the change in climate variables from ERA-Interim reanalysis estimates and their pre-calculated radiative kernels. The results reveal the significant role of clouds in reducing the surface albedo feedback (1.13 +/- 0.44 W m(-2) K-1 in the cloud-free condition, and 0.49 +/- 0.30 W m(-2) K-1 in the all-sky condition), while the lapse rate feedback is predominant in LW radiation (1.33 +/- 0.18 W m(-2) K-1). However, a large portion of the local SW and LW radiative feedbacks were not simply explained by the sum of these individual feedbacks.

On the predictability of lake surface temperature using air temperature in a changing climate: A case study for Lake Tahoe (USA)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; CENTRAL-EUROPEAN LAKE; WATER TEMPERATURES; CALIFORNIA-NEVADA; REGIME SHIFT; DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; IMPACTS; MODELS; STRATIFICATION	Can we predict long-term trends of lake surface temperature based on air temperature alone? We explore this question by analyzing the performance of a hybrid model (air2water) as a predictive tool for defining scenarios of lake surface temperature in the framework of climate change studies. Employing Lake Tahoe (U.S.A.) as a case study, we apply the model using different air temperature datasets (in situ measurements, gridded observations, and downscaled General Circulation Models). Through a data-driven calibration of the model parameters based on surface water temperature records, we show that air2water provides good performance (root mean square error similar to 0.5 degrees C, on a monthly scale) regardless of the input dataset. The model is able to accurately capture the historical long-term trend and interannual fluctuations over decades (from 1969 to present), using only 7 yr of monthly measurements of surface water temperature for calibration. Additionally, when used to predict future surface water temperature of the lake, air2water produces the same projections irrespective of the air temperature dataset used to drive the model. This is certainly desirable, but not immediately expected when using a relatively simple model. Overall, the results suggest the high potential and robustness of air2water as a predictive tool for climate change assessment. Lake surface temperature warming of up to 1.1 degrees C (RCP 4.5) and 2.9 degrees C (RCP 8.5) was simulated at the end of the 21st century during summer months in Lake Tahoe. Such a scenario, if realized, would lead to serious consequences on lake water chemistry, primary productivity, plankton community structure, and nutrient cycling.

Measurements are in the energy range 0.88-2.50 keV/u, corresponding to the energies of the "fast" and "slow" ion components of the SW. Limited agreement is found with single-exchange results calculated in the classical over-the-barrier model. These CE data are useful for understanding, in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, photon emissions in the X-ray to visible energy range arising from resulting ion-stabilization steps.

An Infrared Study of the Circumstellar Material Associated with the Carbon Star R Sculptoris	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: AGB and post-AGB; stars: mass-loss	SHORT-WAVELENGTH SPECTROMETER; DETACHED SHELLS; MASS-LOSS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; STELLAR LIGHT; U-ANT; DUST; ENVELOPES; GRAINS; EVOLUTION	The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star R Sculptoris (R Scl) is one of the most extensively studied stars on the AGB. R Scl is a carbon star with a massive circumstellar shell (M-shell similar to 7.3 x 10(-3) M-circle dot) that is thought to have been produced during a thermal pulse event similar to 2200 years ago. To study the thermal dust emission associated with its circumstellar material, observations were taken with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, 34.8, and 37.1 mu m. Maps of the infrared emission at these wavelengths were used to study the morphology and temperature structure of the spatially extended dust emission. Using the radiative-transfer code DUSTY, and fitting the spatial profile of the emission, we find that a geometrically thin dust shell cannot reproduce the observed spatially resolved emission. Instead, a second dust component in addition to the shell is needed to reproduce the observed emission. This component, which lies interior to the dust shell, traces the circumstellar envelope of R Scl. It is best fit by a density profile with n alpha r(alpha), where alpha = 0.75(-0.25)(+0.45) and a dust mass of M-d = 9.0(-4.1)(+2.3) x 10(-6) M-circle dot. The strong departure from an r(-2) law indicates that the mass-loss rate of R Scl has not been constant. This result is consistent with a slow decline in the post-pulse mass loss that has been inferred from observations of the molecular gas.	[Hankins, M. J.; Herter, T.

We find that for any given precipitation intensity, vapor associated with deep convection is isotopically depleted relative to vapor associated with shallow convection. The intensity of precipitation also plays a role as for any given depth of convection, the relative enrichment of water vapor decreases as the intensity of precipitation increases. Shallow convection, via the uplifting of enriched boundary layer air into the free troposphere and the convective detrainment, enriches the free troposphere. In contrast, deep convection is associated with processes that deplete the water vapor in the free troposphere, such as rain re-evaporation. The results of this study allow for a better identification of the parameters controlling the isotopic composition of the free troposphere and indicate that the isotopic composition of water vapor can be used to evaluate the relative contributions of shallow and deep convection in global models.

Exploring morphology, layering and formation history of linear terrestrial dunes from radar observations: Implications for Titan	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sahara; Dunes; Aeolian processes; Geomorphology; Geophysics; Radar; SIR-C; Radar sounding/Ground Penetrating Radar; Radar imaging; Titan	GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; LOW-FREQUENCY RADAR; SIR-C/X-SAR; SAND DUNES; CASSINI RADAR; WESTERN DESERT; LONGITUDINAL DUNES; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; SOUTHWEST EGYPT; EASTERN SAHARA	Understanding the morphology and internal layering of large aeolian dune fields through radar observations can provide unique insights into the climatic and geophysical conditions that led to their formation. In this study, we perform a large-scale characterization of the morphology and internal layering of linear dunes in hyper-arid areas on Earth, through utilizing multiple complementary radar datasets (SIR-C imaging, SRTM interferometry-derived elevations and radar sounding or Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)). Linear dune fields in the Egyptian desert are of special interest, due to their significance as planetary analogs to dunes on Mars and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Satellite radar imagery and elevation data of the region show significant variance in the geomorphology of different dune fields in Egypt. In addition, GPR probing of the first few meters suggests different inner settings in the layering of dunes of different ages in eastern and western Egypt, reflecting different paleoclimatic regimes that led to their formation. Furthermore, our radiometric analysis suggests that dunes with different inner layering arrangement also exhibit different radar backscatter returns as a function of their heights. For relatively younger dunes with a homogeneous inner structure, like the ones in eastern Egypt in the Qattaniya dune field, we observe that sigma0 does not change as a function of the dune height. For relatively older dunes in western Egypt like the Great Sand Sea (Northern (Siwa) and Southern dune fields), we observed a linear correlation between sigma0 and the dune height. Thus, surface properties of dunes like morphology and backscatter variation with height are related to inner characteristics like arrangement of internal layering, relative ages and can be used to infer their depositional history. Linear dunes discovered in the equatorial regions of Titan by the Cassini-Huygens mission are morphologically very similar to these linear dune fields in the Egyptian Sahara. Hence, assessing the variability of morphology and radar backscatter properties of Titan's dunes as a function of their heights can help constrain the ambiguities associated with their internal structure and formation history and provide insights into Titan's paleowind regimes.

Expansion of major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009 using satellite scatterometer data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urbanization; QuikSCAT; Dense Sampling Method; Impervious surface; LandScan	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; METROPOLITAN-AREA; LIGHT; URBANIZATION; ABUNDANCE; GROWTH; NIGHT; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; IMPACT	A consistent dataset delineating and characterizing changes in urban environments will be valuable for socio-economic and environmental research and for sustainable urban development. Remotely sensed data have been long used to map urban extent and infrastructure at various spatial and spectral resolutions. Although many datasets and approaches have been tried, there is not yet a universal way to map urban extents across the world. Here we combined a microwave scatterometer (QuikSCAT) dataset at similar to 1 km posting with percent impervious surface area (%ISA) data from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) that was generated from Landsat data, and ambient population data from the LandScan product to characterize and quantify growth in nine major urban areas in the US Great Plains from 2000 to 2009. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall trend tests on backscatter time series from urban areas show significant expanding trends in eight of nine urban areas with p-values ranging 0.032 to 0.001. The sole exception is Houston, which has a substantial non-urban backscatter at the northeastern edge of the urban core. Strong power law scaling relationships between ambient population and either urban area or backscatter power (r(2) of 0.96 in either model) with sub-linear exponents (beta of 0.911 and 0.866, respectively) indicate urban areas become more compact with more vertical built-up structure than lateral expansion to accommodate the increased population. Increases in backscatter and %ISA datasets between 2001 and 2006 show agreement in both magnitude and direction for all urban areas except Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP), likely due to the presence of many lakes and ponds throughout the MSP metropolitan area. We conclude discussing complexities in the backscatter data caused by large metal structures and rainfall.

The architecture of the instrument is based on a pseudo-correlation radiometer with analog sideband separation and includes 1/f mitigation by phase-switching the local oscillator (LO) signal. The improved sensitivity of the development comes from the use of high performance Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMIC) chips instead of the typical Schottky diode mixers at the input. We forecast sensitivity per sub-band of 170 mK, at an output instrument rate of 1 Hz.

It was also included on the CDROM distributed with the Handbook of Software Reliability Engineering (M. Lyu, ed). In the years since it was first released, however, CASRE has become more difficult to use. This is mainly because there have been no updates since 2000. The last version of Windows on which CASRE would reliably execute was Windows XP, and since it was developed explicitly for Windows, it is not feasible to run it on other platforms. Software development and acquisition organizations continued to be interested in using tools of the same type as CASRE. In 2013, the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) contacted the authors at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts to determine whether a) CASRE could be modified to run in contemporary environments, or b) whether a new tool with the same functionality as CASRE could be developed with modern programming languages and techniques. After weighing the alternatives, a decision was made to develop a new tool rather than updating CASRE. There were several reasons for which this decision was made. First of all, CASRE had been developed with the programming languages available at the time, in this case C and Fortran. Developing a new tool would allow use of modern, expressive languages and development environments that were particularly well suited to the statistical modeling domain (e.g., R, RStudio). Developing a new tool would also allow us to implement it so that it would run in modern operating environments, specifically Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and Linux. This last design decision would make it possible for users who would not have been able to run CASRE to use the new tool. We wanted to address the difficulty of adding new models to CASRE, since it was not architected for ease of modification. We wanted to develop a tool for which it would be easy to add new models and model evaluation techniques (e.g., prequential likelihood ratio, Akaike Information Criterion). This would enable organizations already using software reliability modeling to manage their testing to place the models they were using into a common framework, making it easier to evaluate multiple sets of results to gain additional insight into their testing process. Researchers would also gain an advantage by having a common framework in which to work with multiple models, analyze their results, and identify relationships among them. Finally, this would make it practical to distribute as open-source software, to which contributors could add new models and evaluation techniques as they were developed by the research community and validated by practitioners. We have used these ideas to develop the Software Failure and Reliability Assessment Tool (SFRAT). It is implemented in R, uses the Shiny user interface package, and will run in any environment in which R and RStudio can run. We intend for it to be an open-source tool with a mechanism for contributors to add new capabilities. Our hope is that distributing SFRAT as open-source software will allow it to retain currency in the software reliability practice and research communities.

Using 1 Watt, 94 GHz MMIC chips in a two-way cavity mode combiner, we were able to achieve 2 Watts of output power with 9 dB gain and 15 % PAE. This technique could be extended to high power MMICs and larger numbers of chips to achieve higher output power in a compact size.

Additionally, power restrictions prevent the use of survival heating during the night. The harsh mechanical vibration environment of launch and landing provides an additional challenge to reliability. A multi-physics simulation was created that took into account temperature property variations, as well as solving the transient analysis that also included rapid variation in power-pulsing during the operation of the laser. The steady state analysis employed a more traditional finite element based analysis, but with provisions for Mars gas convection and thermal radiation.

Adapted from land-based measurements, this test methodology involves hoisting the antenna under test using a helium-filled aerostat above the earth to minimize ground interactions while flying a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) with onboard RF measurement equipment package to map the far field radiation pattern. Prior to testing the technique using both airborne platforms - the aerostat and the sUAS - measurements are performed on the ground using the sUAS and a fixed VHF dipole over a ground plane to verify the methodology prior to incorporating the flying aerostat for airborne measurements of the HF dipole. These initial measurements have produced promising far-field pattern results with work remaining to fully adapt the fixed VHF antenna measurements to the dynamic HF antenna test setup that uses two airborne platforms (sUAS and aerostat) for measurements.

For many applications, such as the design of missions involving multiple spacecraft, the resulting set of Pareto-optimal solution models can be too large to be consumed directly, requiring additional analyses in order to gain meaningful insights. In this paper, we investigate the use of automated clustering techniques for grouping similar solution models, and introduce and study a number of both generic and domain-specific methods for measuring the similarity of the solution models. We report results from applying our approach to the exploration of the design space of a spacecraft-based interferometry array in a lunar orbit. For purposes of evaluation and validation, results from the application to the case study are correlated with the results from a study in which solution models were clustered manually by groups of domain experts. The results show tradeoffs in the granularity and extensibility of applying clustering approaches to spacecraft mission architecture models. Also, what humans consider to be relevant in assessing architectural similarity varies and is often biased by their background and expertise. We conclude that providing the subjects with a range of clustering tools has the potential to strongly enhance the ability to explore the complex design space of multi-spacecraft missions, and gain deep insights into the trade space.

Design Considerations of a Flying Capacitor Multilevel Flyback Converter for DC-DC and Pulsed Power Applications	IECON 2018 - 44TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 20-23, 2018	Washington, DC	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		DC/DC; flyback design; flying capacitor multilevel design; inductor layout; pulsed power; switch stress		This paper presents the development of a Flying Capacitor Multilevel Flyback Converter (FCMFC) that provides easily scalable peak output voltage for pulsed power. Based on a combination of the flyback and flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) boost converter topologies, the FCMFC achieves faster slew rates and peak power than previous pulsed power converters. FCMFC distributes the high voltage gain across the switch-diode-capacitor (SDC) stages, lowering device stresses and reducing the required magnetic component size compared to existing architectures. Two applications are addressed in this work: one for DC-DC boosting and one for pulsed power conversion. The FCMFC achieved a 100V to 1000V step-up while only utilizing half of the electrical hardware compared to existing topologies. Another FCMFC was developed to produce 36kV pulses at 8kV/u.s, with a 50% decrease in the magnetic component size compared to an existing architecture from the literature.

Space- and ground-based non-accelerated long lifetime data for ruggedized commercial Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) lasers	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPACE OPTICS-ICSO 2018	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Space Optics (ICSO)	OCT 09-12, 2018	Chania, GREECE			laser; lifetime; space		Lifetime data is presented for ruggedized commercial NPRO lasers used in the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) Instrument on NASA's Aura Earth-orbiting spacecraft, including 20 years of data from two life test units on the ground, 12 years of on-orbit data from TES Laser A, and 2 years of on-orbit data from TES Laser B. The TES lasers are diode-pumped Non-Planar Ring Oscillator (NPRO) lasers using Nd:YAG crystals. Since accelerated life testing was not possible on the complete laser, early prototype lasers that had gone through thermal cycling and vibration testing were placed on non-accelerated life tests with the hope of gathering at least a couple of years of data before launch. Long-term lifetime data for hybrid laser systems in space applications is not abundant, and out of necessity, accelerated reliability testing is usually done over a relatively short time with a large number of devices. The data presented in this paper is unique as it tracks the optical power output over time of a total of four lasers on the order of decades rather than months or years. Two of the lasers have each been on life test for over 20 years on the ground and are still operating, and the other two lasers have been on-orbit for 14 years. TES Laser A was still operating when the TES Instrument was decommissioned in January 2018. Therefore, the data presented covers over 450,000 non-accelerated device-hours, with 23% of those hours being in space.	[Asbury, C. G.; Dorsky, L. I.; Nerheim, N. M.; Forouhar, S.; Rider, D.

The 2-mu m laser wavelength is of particular interest due to the presence of many CO2 and H2O absorption lines in its vicinity(1). Transmitter architectures are typically composed of an optically pumped, frequency-stable, solid-state seed laser and a high-power optical amplifier.(2, 3) Taking advantage of the reliability and relative simplicity of semiconductor lasers, this architecture can substantially improve by replacing the solid-state light source with semiconductor lasers of comparable performance. This approach will greatly improve the system reliability, and will simplify instrument integration and space qualification. There are currently very limited semiconductor lasers operating in the 2-mu m range with performance satisfactory enough for use as an injection seed in a laser absorption spectrometer. Optimally, seed lasers producing greater than 50 mW of continuous-wave (CW), with frequency jitter of less than 1 MHz are desired to reliably resolve the CO2 absorption lines near 2-mu m. In this paper, we report the demonstration of high-power, single-longitudinal-mode laterally coupled distributed feedback (LC-DFB) lasers at 2.05 mu m wavelength. We measured more than 80 mW of CW power at -10 degrees C for devices with a 4-mu m-wide ridge and 2-mm-long cavity.

The use of intelligent systems to detect trafficking can thus have a direct impact on investigative resource allocation and decision-making, and, more broadly, help curb a widespread social problem. Trafficking detection involves assigning a normalized score to a set of escort advertisements crawled from the Web - a higher score indicates a greater risk of trafficking-related (involuntary) activities. In this paper, we define and study the problem of trafficking detection and present a trafficking detection pipeline architecture developed over three years of research within the DARPA Memex program. Drawing on multi-institutional data, systems, and experiences collected during this time, we also conduct post hoc bias analyses and present a bias mitigation plan. Our findings show that, while automatic trafficking detection is an important application of AI for social good, it also provides cautionary lessons for deploying predictive machine learning algorithms without appropriate de-biasing. This ultimately led to integration of an interpretable solution into a search system that contains over 100 million advertisements and is used by over 200 law enforcement agencies to investigate leads.

To support these decision-making tasks, which may require elastic prioritization of goals dependent on changing conditions, custom analytics tools are often developed. We were asked to develop such a tool by a team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where rover telecom operators make decisions based on models predicting how much data rovers can transfer from the surface of Mars. Through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. We offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems. The principles we present are applicable to designers and developers tasked with building analytics systems in domains that face complex operations challenges such as scheduling, routing, and logistics.

Generalized radiative transfer theory for scattering by particles in an absorbing gas: Addressing both spatial and spectral integration in multi-angle remote sensing of optically thin aerosol layers	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							CORRELATED RANDOM MEDIUM; AVERAGED SOLAR FLUXES; OXYGEN A-BAND; PATH-LENGTH; BOLTZMANN-EQUATION; PHOTON PROPAGATION; JOINT STATISTICS; BROKEN CLOUDS; K METHOD; TRANSPORT	We demonstrate the computational advantage gained by introducing non-exponential transmission laws into radiative transfer theory for two specific situations. One is the problem of spatial integration over a large domain where the scattering particles cluster randomly in a medium uniformly filled with an absorbing gas, and only a probabilistic description of the variability is available. The increasingly important application here is passive atmospheric profiling using oxygen absorption in the visible/near-IR spectrum. The other scenario is spectral integration over a region where the absorption cross-section of a spatially uniform gas varies rapidly and widely and, moreover, there are scattering particles embedded in the gas that are distributed uniformly, or not. This comes up in many applications, O-2 A-band profiling being just one instance. We bring a common framework to solve these problems both efficiently and accurately that is grounded in the recently developed theory of Generalized Radiative Transfer (GRT). In GRT, the classic exponential law of transmission is replaced by one with a slower power-law decay that accounts for the unresolved spectral or spatial variability. Analytical results are derived in the single-scattering limit that applies to optically thin aerosol layers. In spectral integration, a modest gain in accuracy is obtained. As for spatial integration of near-monochromatic radiance, we find that, although both continuum and in band radiances are affected by moderate levels of sub-pixel variability, only extreme variability will affect in-band/continuum ratios.

Shaler: insitu analysis of a fluvial sedimentary deposit on Mars	SEDIMENTOLOGY			English	Article						Fluvial; Gale crater; Mars; sedimentology; stratigraphy	TROUGH CROSS STRATIFICATION; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; GALE CRATER; FLOW; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; SYSTEM; UNIT; SCOTLAND	This paper characterizes the detailed sedimentology of a fluvial sandbody on Mars for the first time and interprets its depositional processes and palaeoenvironmental setting. Despite numerous orbital observations of fluvial landforms on the surface of Mars, ground-based characterization of the sedimentology of such fluvial deposits has not previously been possible. Results from the NASA Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover provide an opportunity to reconstruct at fine scale the sedimentary architecture and palaeomorphology of a fluvial environment on Mars. This work describes the grain size, texture and sedimentary facies of the Shaler outcrop, reconstructs the bedding architecture, and analyses cross-stratification to determine palaeocurrents. On the basis of bedset geometry and inclination, grain-size distribution and bedform migration direction, this study concludes that the Shaler outcrop probably records the accretion of a fluvial barform. The majority of the outcrop consists of large-scale trough cross-bedding of coarse sand and granules. Palaeocurrent analyses and bedform reconstruction indicate that the beds were deposited by bedforms that migrated towards the north-east, across the surface of a bar that migrated south-east. Stacked cosets of dune cross-bedding suggest aggradation of multiple bedforms, which provides evidence for short periods of sustained flow during Shaler deposition. However, local evidence for aeolian reworking and the presence of potential desiccation cracks within the outcrop suggest that fluvial deposition may have been intermittent. The uppermost strata at Shaler are distinct in terms of texture and chemistry and are inferred to record deposition from a different sediment dispersal system with a contrasting provenance. The outcrop as a whole is a testament to the availability of liquid water on the surface of Mars in its early history.

However, the sky is bright in the thermal infrared (3-5 mu m), and the correspondingly small fields of view of available detectors make it highly unusual to have a calibration star in the same field as a science target. Here, we present a new method of obtaining differential photometry by simultaneously imaging a science target and a calibrator star, separated by less than or similar to 2 amin, onto a 10 x 10 asec(2) field-of-view detector. We do this by taking advantage of the Large Binocular Telescope's (LBT) unique binocular design to point the two co-mounted telescopes apart and simultaneously obtain both targets in three sets of observations. Results indicate that the achievable scatter in L-S-band (lambda(c) = 3.3 mu m) is at the percent level for bright targets and possibly better with heavier sampling and characterization of the systematics.

Role of the mass attenuation coefficient database in standardization of a silicon drift X-ray detector for PIXE analysis	X-RAY SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							L-SHELL; FLUORESCENCE YIELDS; K-SHELL; IONIZATION; PROTONS; SYSTEM; WIDTHS	A simple, inexpensive procedure is described for calibrating a silicon drift detector-based PIXE system for the analysis of geological and other thick-target materials. It rests on the use of single element, chemical compound, and National Institute for Standards and Technology multielement standards. Much less effort has been focussed on the impact of mass attenuation coefficients on PIXE's analytical accuracy than on ionization cross sections and fluorescence yields. The calibrated system enables us to investigate the effects of inserting different mass attenuation coefficient datasets into the GUPIX database. For the K X-rays of light elements, accuracy is significantly improved by replacing the formerly used XCOM self-attenuation coefficients by the corresponding FFAST values; this effect decreases rapidly with increasing atomic number. Similar improvement was found for L X-rays of medium-Z, but not for high-Z atoms.

Scott			Identification of young stellar variables with KELT for K2 - II. The Upper Scorpius association	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be	PRE-MAIN-SEQUENCE; CENTAURUS OB ASSOCIATION; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; T-TAURI STARS; SPACED DATA; UPPER SCO; KEPLER; TELESCOPE; ACCRETION; EVOLUTION	High-precision photometry from space-based missions such as K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite enables detailed studies of young star variability. However, because space-based observing campaigns are often short (e.g. 80 d for K2), complementary long-baseline photometric surveys are critical for obtaining a complete understanding of young star variability, which can change on time-scales of minutes to years. We therefore present and analyse light curves of members of the Upper Scorpius association made over 5.5 yr by the ground-based Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), which complement the high-precision observations of this region taken by K2 during its Campaigns 2 and 15. We show that KELT data accurately identify the periodic signals found with high-precision K2 photometry, demonstrating the power of ground-based surveys in deriving stellar rotation periods of young stars. We also use KELT data to identify sources exhibiting variability that is likely related to circumstellar material and/or stellar activity cycles; these signatures are often unseen in the short-term K2 data, illustrating the importance of long-term monitoring surveys for studying the full range of young star variability. We provide the KELT light curves as electronic tables in an ongoing effort to establish legacy time series data sets for young stellar clusters.

The new device measures gas or volatile composition in situ and has a nominal volume of 12 cm(3), which is 200 times smaller than cavities operating at comparable frequencies in laboratory gas spectrometers. Scans of mode amplitude are presented as a function of mirror spacing and transmitter frequency. Primary (TEM00) and secondary (TEM10) modes are both observed and are matched to an eigenmode calculation. The modes are well-behaved and have quality factors in the range of 1000-6000, which is a desirable compromise between field strength and mode width. Measurements of pulse bandwidth versus duration agree with time-bandwidth product predictions. Measurements of rotational transitions in N2O and CH3OH are plotted at various pressures and collisional broadening is resolved at mTorr pressures. Through these gas detections, we demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the size of cavity spectrometers for in situ deployment. The new device opens new possibilities for molecular sensing in pollution monitoring, planetary science, and other fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unlike traditional data and image compression methods, the goal of ASDC is to create a new dataset that will be used as input into spatial-prediction methods, such as traditional kriging or Fixed Rank Kriging, where using the full dataset may be computationally infeasible. ASDC can be classified as a lossy compression method and is based on spectral clustering. It aims to produce contiguous spatial clusters and to preserve the spatial-correlation structure of the data so that the loss of predictive information is minimal. An extensive simulation study demonstrates the predictive performance of these adaptively compressed datasets for several scenarios. ASDC is compared to two other data-reduction schemes, one using local neighborhoods and one using simple binning. An application to remotely sensed sea-surface-temperature data is also presented, and computational costs are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study the dynamics of this layer using a numerical model of two-phase ice-water mixture in two-dimensional Cartesian geometry. While focusing on the generation of water at the silicate/HP ice interface and its upward migration towards the ocean, we investigate the effect of bottom heat flux, the layer thickness, and the HP ice viscosity and permeability. Our results suggest that melt can be generated at the silicate/HP ice interface for small layer thickness (less than or similar to 200 km) and high values of heat flux (greater than or similar to 20 mW m(-2)) and viscosity (greater than or similar to 10(15) Pa s). Once generated, the water is transported through the layer by the upwelling plumes. Depending on the vigor of convection, it stays liquid or it may freeze before melting again as the plume reaches the temperate (partially molten) layer at the boundary with the ocean. The thickness of this layer as well as the amount of melt that is extracted from it is controlled by the permeability of the HP ice. This process constitutes a means of transporting volatiles and salts that might have dissolved into the melt present at the silicate/HP ice interface. As the moon cools down, the HP ice layer becomes less permeable because the heat flux from the silicates decreases and the HP ice layer thickens. (C)2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Ceres gravity field, spin pole, rotation period and orbit from the Dawn radiometric tracking and optical data	ICARUS			English	Article							ASTEROID MASSES; GLOBAL SOLUTION; EPHEMERIS; THICKNESS; ANOMALIES; VESTA	Ceres' gravity field and rotational parameters have been precisely measured using 1.5 years of radiometric Doppler and range data and optical landmark tracking from the Dawn spacecraft in orbit about the dwarf planet. As was the case with Dawn at Vesta, the gravity field, orientation parameters, landmark locations, and Ceres' orbit are jointly estimated in a global solution. Even though Dawn's radio science investigation at Ceres was complicated by additional thrusting for attitude control, the resulting spherical harmonic gravity field has a half-wavelength resolution of up to 82 km (degree 18) near the equator, which is similar harmonic resolution to that of Vesta. The gravity field is consistent with Airy isostatic compensation, and this model assumption limits Ceres' crustal density to be between 1200 and 1600 kg/m(3) for two-layer and three-layer models with mean crustal thickness between 27 and 43 km. The compensation depth is determined using admittance between gravity and gravity from topography and is superior to admittance between gravity and topography. The gravitational mass of Ceres is determined to better than 0.002% (GM(Ceres)=62.62736 +/- 0.00040 km(3)/s(2)), the spin pole location is improved by 10x over previous results with right ascension (alpha = 291.427 degrees) and declination (delta = 66.760 degrees) uncertainty less than 0.001 degrees, and the rotation rate is improved by similar to 100x over previous determinations from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Ceres' heliocentric orbit has also been improved, with about 17 months of precision range measurements reducing ephemeris uncertainties to about 10 m during the Dawn timeframe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Results from the dynamic albedo of neutrons (DAN) passive mode experiment: Yellowknife Bay to Amargosa Valley (Sols 201-753)	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Mars, surface; Cosmic rays	GALE CRATER; MARS; HYDROGEN; ENVIRONMENT; INSTRUMENT; ONBOARD	The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover) Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) experiment detects neutrons for the purpose of searching for hydrogen in the shallow subsurface of Mars. DAN has two modes of operation, active and passive. In passive mode, the instrument detects neutrons produced by Galactic Cosmic Ray interactions in the atmosphere and regolith and by the rover's Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. DAN passive data from Yellowknife Bay to Amargosa Valley (sols 201 through 753) are presented and analyzed here. Water equivalent hydrogen (WEH) estimates from this portion of Curiosity's traverse range from 0.0 wt. % up to 15.3 wt. %. Typical uncertainties on these WEH estimates are 0.5 wt. % but in some cases can be as high as similar to 4.0 wt. % depending on the specific circumstances of a given measurement. Here we also present a new way of reporting results from the passive mode of the experiment, the DAN passive geochemical index (DPGI). This index is sensitive to some key geochemical variations, but it does not require assumptions about the abundances of high thermal neutron absorption cross section elements, which are needed to estimate WEH. DPGI variations in this section of the traverse indicate that the shallow regolith composition is changing on both the local ( meters) and regional (-100 s of meters) scales. This variability is thought to be representative of the diverse composition of source regions for sediments within the crater floor. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests on the populations of WEH estimates and DPGI values demonstrate there are statistically significant differences between nearly all of the geologic units investigated along the rover's traverse. We also present updated previous DAN passive results from Bradbury Landing to John Klein that make use of revised DAN active mode results for calibration, however, no qualitative changes in the interpretations made in Tate et al. (2015b) are incurred. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Tate, C.

But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both and quantifies uncertainties. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.

Spatial Representativeness of Surface-Measured Variations of Downward Solar Radiation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						spatiotemporal representativeness; surface solar radiation	ENERGY-BALANCE ARCHIVE; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; HOMOGENEITY; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; IRRADIANCE; ABSORPTION; REANALYSIS; RESOLUTION; RETRIEVAL	When using time series of ground-based surface solar radiation (SSR) measurements in combination with gridded data, the spatial and temporal representativeness of the point observations must be considered. We use SSR data from surface observations and high-resolution (0.05 degrees) satellite-derived data to infer the spatiotemporal representativeness of observations for monthly and longer time scales in Europe. The correlation analysis shows that the squared correlation coefficients (R-2) between SSR times series decrease linearly with increasing distance between the surface observations. For deseasonalized monthly mean time series, R-2 ranges from 0.85 for distances up to 25km between the stations to 0.25 at distances of 500km. A decorrelation length (i.e., the e-folding distance of R-2) on the order of 400km (with spread of 100-600km) was found. R-2 from correlations between point observations and colocated grid box area means determined from satellite data were found to be 0.80 for a 1 degrees grid. To quantify the error which arises when using a point observation as a surrogate for the area mean SSR of larger surroundings, we calculated a spatial sampling error (SSE) for a 1 degrees grid of 8(3)W/m(2) for monthly (annual) time series. The SSE based on a 1 degrees grid, therefore, is of the same magnitude as the measurement uncertainty. The analysis generally reveals that monthly mean (or longer temporally aggregated) point observations of SSR capture the larger-scale variability well. This finding shows that comparing time series of SSR measurements with gridded data is feasible for those time scales.

The greatest gains, at more than 20%, have come for lithium fluoride-protected aluminum, which has the shortest wavelength cutoff of any conventional overcoat. Despite the success of the NASA FUSE mission, the use of lithium fluoride (LiF)-based optics is rare, as LiF is hygroscopic and requires handling procedures that can drive risk. With NASA now studying two large mission concepts for astronomy, Large UV-Optical-IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) and the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx), which mandate throughput down to 1000 A, the development of LiF-based coatings becomes crucial. This paper discusses steps that are being taken to qualify these new enhanced LiF-protected aluminum (eLiF) mirror coatings for flight. In addition to quantifying the hygroscopic degradation, we have developed a new method of protecting eLiF with an ultrathin (10-20 angstrom) capping layer of a non-hygroscopic material to increase durability. We report on the performance of eLiF-based optics and assess the steps that need to be taken to qualify such coatings for LUVOIR, HabEx, and other FUV-sensitive space missions.

Here we present optical and UV data and analysis of intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) 16asu, a luminous, rapidly evolving, high-velocity, stripped-envelope supernova ( SN). With a rest-frame rise time of just four. days and a peak absolute magnitude of M-g = -20.4 mag, the light curve of iPTF 16asu is faster and more luminous than that of previous rapid transients. The spectra of iPTF 16asu show a featureless blue continuum near peak that develops into an SN Ic-BL spectrum on the decline. We show that while the late-time light curve could plausibly be powered by Ni-56 decay, the early emission requires a different energy source. Nondetections in the X-ray and radio strongly constrain the energy coupled to relativistic ejecta to be at most comparable to the class of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We suggest that the early emission may have been powered by either a rapidly spinning-down magnetar or by shock breakout in an extended envelope of a very energetic explosion. In either scenario a central engine is required, making iPTF 16asu an intriguing transition object between superluminous SNe, SNe Ic-BL, and low-luminosity GRBs.

A concurrent increase in atmospheric ethane implicates a fossil source; a concurrent decrease in the heavy isotope content of methane points toward a biogenic source, while other studies propose a decrease in the chemical sink (OH). Here we show that biomass burning emissions of methane decreased by 3.7 (+/- 1.4) Tg CH4 per year from the 2001-2007 to the 2008-2014 time periods using satellite measurements of CO and CH4, nearly twice the decrease expected from prior estimates. After updating both the total and isotopic budgets for atmospheric methane with these revised biomass burning emissions (and assuming no change to the chemical sink), we find that fossil fuels contribute between 12-19 Tg CH4 per year to the recent atmospheric methane increase, thus reconciling the isotopic-and ethane-based results.

These two events were coincident with observations of hydrogen deuterium oxide (HDO) depletion, indicating that condensation and sublimation occurred during the transport of the ozone-depleted air masses. Ice clouds (vapour and crystals) and aerosols were detected by lidar and radar when the ozone- and HDO-depleted air masses arrived over Eureka. For the 2007 event, an ice cloud layer was coincident with an aloft ozone depletion layer at 870 m altitude on 2-3 March, indicating this ice cloud layer contained bromine-enriched blowing-snow particles. Over the following 3 days, a shallow surface ozone depletion event (ODE) was observed at Eureka after the precipitation of bromine-enriched particles onto the local snowpack. A chemistry-climate model (UKCA) and a chemical transport model (pTOMCAT) were used to simulate the surface ozone depletion events. Incorporating the latest surface snow salinity data obtained for the Weddell Sea into the models resulted in improved agreement between the modelled and measured BrO concentrations above Eureka. MERRA-2 global reanalysis data and the FLEXPART particle dispersion model were used to study the link between the ozone and HDO depletion. In general, the modelled ozone and BrO showed good agreement with the ground-based observations; however, the modelled BrO and ozone in the near-surface layer are quite sensitive to the snow salinity. HDO depletion observed during these two blowing-snow ODEs was found to be weaker than pure Rayleigh fractionation. This work provides evidence of a blowing-snow sublimation process, which is a key step in producing bromine-enriched sea-salt aerosol.

Testing physical models for dipolar asymmetry with CMB polarization	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							POWER ASYMMETRIES; TEMPERATURE; MODULATION	The cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies exhibit a large-scale dipolar power asymmetry. To determine whether this is due to a real, physical modulation or is simply a large statistical fluctuation requires the measurement of new modes. Here we forecast how well CMB polarization data from Planck and future experiments will be able to confirm or constrain physical models for modulation. Fitting several such models to the Planck temperature data allows us to provide predictions for polarization asymmetry. While for some models and parameters Planck polarization will decrease error bars on the modulation amplitude by only a small percentage, we show, importantly, that cosmic-variance-limited (and in some cases even Planck) polarization data can decrease the errors by considerably better than the expectation of root 2 based on simple l-spacearguments. We project that if the primordial fluctuations are truly modulated (with parameters as indicated by Planck temperature data) then Planck will be able to make a 2 sigma detection of the modulation model with 20%-75% probability, increasing to 45%-99% when cosmicvariance-limited polarization is considered. We stress that these results are quite model dependent. Cosmic variance in temperature is important: combining statistically isotropic polarization with temperature data will spuriously increase the significance of the temperature signal with 30% probability for Planck.

Titan's Topography and Shape at the End of the Cassini Mission	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							FLUVIAL EROSION; RADAR; ATMOSPHERE; MORPHOLOGY; CLOUDS	With the conclusion of the Cassini mission, we present an updated topographic map of Titan, including all the available altimetry, SARtopo, and stereophotogrammetry topographic data sets available from the mission. We use radial basis functions to interpolate the sparse data set, which covers only similar to 9% of Titan's global area. The most notable updates to the topography include higher coverage of the poles of Titan, improved fits to the global shape, and a finer resolution of the global interpolation. We also present a statistical analysis of the error in the derived products and perform a global minimization on a profile-by-profile basis to account for observed biases in the input data set. We find a greater flattening of Titan than measured, additional topographic rises in Titan's southern hemisphere and better constrain the possible locations of past and present liquids on Titan's surface.

Topographic Constraints on the Evolution and Connectivity of Titan's Lacustrine Basins	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LAKES; DISSOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; LANDSCAPE; MODEL; CAP	The topography provided by altimetry, synthetic aperture radar-topography, and stereo radargrammetry has opened new doors for Titan research by allowing for quantitative analysis of morphologic form. Using altimetry measurements, we show that Titan's Maria are consistent with an equipotential surface but that several filled lakes are found to be hundreds of meters above this sea level, suggesting that they exist in isolated or perched basins. Within a given drainage basin, empty lake floors are typically higher than the liquid elevation of nearby lakes/seas, suggesting local subsurface connectivity. The majority of Titan's lakes reside in topographically closed, sharp-edged depressions whose planform curvature suggests lateral expansion through uniform scarp retreat. Many, but not all, empty lake basins exhibit flat floors and hectometer-scale raised rims that present a challenge to formation models. We conclude that dissolution erosion can best match the observed constraints but that challenges remain in the interpretation of formation processes and materials.	[Hayes, A. G.; Birch, S. P.

Redetection of the Ionospheric H-3(+) Signature of Saturn's "Ring Rain"	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MODEL; ATMOSPHERE; PLANETS; TEMPERATURE; PIONEER-11; VOYAGER-2; EMISSION; LOCATION; INFLUX; SYSTEM	In April 2011 Saturn's midlatitude ionospheric H-3(+) emissions were detected, exhibiting anomalous (nonsolar) H-3(+) latitudinal variations consistent with the transport of water from specific locations in Saturn's rings, known as "ring rain". These products, transported to the planet along the magnetic field, may help to explain the unusual pattern of peaks and troughs in electron densities discovered in Saturn's ionosphere by spacecraft flybys. In the present study, we analyzed H-3(+) emissions recorded on 23 April 2013, showing for the first time since the original detection that Saturn's H-3(+) emissions are indeed heavily modified. Although the 2013 emissions are dimmer by almost a factor of 3.7, the latitudinal contrast is greater and uncertainties are lower. Increased H-3(+) intensities were found near planetocentric latitudes of 43 degrees, 51 degrees, and 63 degrees, previously identified with sources at the inner edge of the B ring, A ring, and the orbit of Enceladus and associated E ring.

Satellite drag effects due to uplifted oxygen neutrals during super magnetic storms	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							LATITUDE F-REGION; ENERGY ACCOMMODATION; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; OCTOBER 2003; ART.; COEFFICIENTS; IONOSPHERE; EQUATORIAL; GPS; NETWORK	During intense magnetic storms, prompt penetration electric fields (PPEFs) through E X B forces near the magnetic equator uplift the dayside ionosphere. This effect has been called the "dayside super-fountain effect". Ionneutral drag forces between the upward moving O+ (oxygen ions) and oxygen neutrals will elevate the oxygen atoms to higher altitudes. This paper gives a linear calculation indicating how serious the effect may be during an 1859-type (Carrington) superstorm. It is concluded that the oxygen neutral densities produced at low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellite altitudes may be sufficiently high to present severe satellite drag. It is estimated that with a prompt penetrating electric field of similar to 20mVm(-1) turned on for 20 min, the O atoms and O+ ions are uplifted to 850 km where they produce about 40-times-greater satellite drag per unit mass than normal. Stronger electric fields will presumably lead to greater uplifted mass.

Global satellite observations of column-averaged carbon dioxide and methane: The GHG-CCI XCO2 and XCH4 CRDP3 data set	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SCIAMACHY; GOSAT; Greenhouse gases; Carbon dioxide; Methane; Climate change	CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SOLAR OCCULTATION; TROPOSPHERIC METHANE; SENTINEL-5 PRECURSOR; GREENHOUSE GASES; SEASONAL CYCLE; REGIONAL CO2; FOSSIL-FUEL; GOSAT DATA	Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the two most important greenhouse gases emitted by mankind. Better knowledge of the surface sources and sinks of these Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related carbon uptake and release processes is needed for important climate change related applications such as improved climate modelling and prediction. Some satellites provide near-surface-sensitive atmospheric CO2 and CH4 observations that can be used to obtain information on CQ(2) and CH4 surface fluxes. The goal of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) is to use satellite data to generate atmospheric CO2 and CH4 data products meeting demanding GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) greenhouse gas (GHG) ECV requirements. To achieve this, retrieval algorithms are regularly being improved followed by annual data reprocessing and analysis cycles to generate better products in terms of extended time series and continuously improved data quality. Here we present an overview about the latest GHG-CCI data set called Climate Research Data Package No.3 (CRDP3) focusing on the GHG-CCI core data products, which are column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4, i.e., XCO2 and XCH4, as retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO/GOSAT satellite radiances covering the time period end of 2002 to end of 2014. We present global maps and time series including initial validation results obtained by comparisons with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based observations. We show that the GCOS requirements for systematic error (<1 ppm for XCO2, <10 ppb for XCH4) and long-term stability (<0.2 ppm/year for XCO2, <2 ppb/year for XCH4) are met for nearly all products (an exception is SCIAMACHY methane especially since 2010). For XCO2 we present comparisons with global models using the output of two CO2 assimilation systems (MACC version 14r2 and CarbonTracker version CT2013B). We show that overall there is reasonable consistency and agreement between all data sets (within-1-2 ppm) but we also found significant differences depending on region and time period.

Thermophysics of fractures on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; radiation mechanisms: thermal	WATER ICE; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; THERMAL INERTIA; SOLAR-SYSTEM; NUCLEUS; EVOLUTION; MODEL; HEAT; TEMPERATURE; SUBLIMATION	Context. The camera OSIRIS on board Rosetta obtained high-resolution images of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). Great parts of the nucleus surface are composed of fractured terrain. Aims. Fracture formation, evolution, and their potential relationship to physical processes that drive activity are not yet fully understood. Observed temperatures and gas production rates can be explained or interpreted with the presence of fractures by applying appropriate modelling methods. Methods. We followed a transient thermophysical model approach that includes radiative, conductive, and water-ice sublimation fluxes by considering a variety of heliocentric distances, illumination conditions, and thermophysical properties for a set of characteristic fracture geometries on the nucleus of 67P. We computed diurnal temperatures, heat fluxes, and outgassing behaviour in order to derive and distinguish the influence of the mentioned parameters on fractured terrain. Results. Our analysis confirms that fractures, as already indicated by former studies about concavities, deviate from flat-terrain topographies with equivalent properties, mostly through the effect of self-heating. Compared to flat terrain, illuminated cometary fractures are generally warmer, with smaller diurnal temperature fluctuations. Maximum sublimation rates reach higher peaks, and dust mantle quenching effects on sublimation rates are weaker. Consequently, the rough structure of the fractured terrain leads to significantly higher inferred surface thermal inertia values than for flat areas with identical physical properties, which might explain the range of measured thermal inertia on 67P. Conclusions. At 3.5 AU heliocentric distance, sublimation heat sinks in fractures converge to maximum values > 50 W/m(2) and trigger dust activity that can be related mainly to H2O. Fractures are likely to grow through the erosive interplay of alternating sublimation and thermal fatigue.	[Hoefner, S.; Vincent, J. -B.; Sierks, H.; Deller, J.; Hofmann, M.; A'Hearn, M.

Extending the exozodiacal light survey with CHARA/JouFLU	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						circumstellar matter; binaries: close; planets and satellites: detection; techniques: interferometric	DUST RING FORMATION; CHARA ARRAY; KAPPA-CRB; COMPANIONS; ANDROMEDAE; PLANETS; SYSTEM; CHARA/FLUOR; SUBLIMATION; PARTICLES	We report the results of high-angular-resolution observations that search for exozodiacal light in a sample of main sequence stars and sub-giants. Using the "jouvence" of the fiber linked unit for optical recombination (JouFLU) at the center for high angular resolution astronomy (CHARA) telescope array, we have observed a total of 44 stars. Out of the 44 stars, 33 are new stars added to the initial, previously published survey of 42 stars performed at CHARA with the fiber linked unit for optical recombination (FLUOR). Since the start of the survey extension, we have detected a K-band circumstellar excess for six new stars at the similar to 1% level or higher, four of which are known or candidate binaries, and two for which the excess could be attributed to exozodiacal dust. We have also performed follow-up observations of 11 of the stars observed in the previously published survey and found generally consistent results. We do however detect a significantly larger excess on three of these follow-up targets: Altair, v And and kappa CrB. Interestingly, the last two are known exoplanet host stars. We perform a statistical analysis of the JouFLU and FLUOR samples combined, which yields an overall exozodi detection rate of 21.7(-4.1)(+5.7) %. We also find that the K-band excess in FGK-type stars correlates with the existence of an outer reservoir of cold (less than or similar to 100 K) dust at the 99% confidence level, while the same cannot be said for A-type stars.

Looking at A 0535+26 at low luminosities with NuSTAR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: binaries; pulsars: individual: A 0535+26; stars: neutron; accretion, accretion disks; stars: magnetic field	X-RAY PULSARS; GIANT OUTBURST; CYCLOTRON LINE; PHASE SPECTROSCOPY; ABSORPTION FEATURE; MAGNETIC-FIELD; TRANSIENT; A0535+26; TELESCOPE; ACCRETION	We report on two NuSTAR observations of the high-mass X-ray binary A 0535 + 26 taken toward the end of its normal 2015 outburst at very low 3-50 keV luminosities of similar to 1.4 x 10(36) erg s(-1) and similar to 5 x 10(35) erg s(-1), which are complemented by nine Swift observations. The data clearly confirm indications seen in earlier data that the source's spectral shape softens as it becomes fainter. The smooth exponential rollover at high energies seen in the first observation evolves to a much more abrupt steepening of the spectrum at 20-30 keV. The continuum evolution can be nicely described with emission from a magnetized accretion column, modeled using the compmag model modified by an additional Gaussian emission component for the fainter observation. Between the two observations, the optical depth changes from 0.75 +/- 0.04 to 0.56(-0.04)(+0.01), the electron temperature remains constant, and there is an indication that the column decreases in radius. Since the energy-resolved pulse profiles remain virtually unchanged in shape between the two observations, the emission properties of the accretion column reflect the same accretion regime. This conclusion is also confirmed by our result that the energy of the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at similar to 45 keV is independent of the luminosity, implying that the magnetic field in the region in which the observed radiation is produced is the same in both observations. Finally, we also constrain the evolution of the continuum parameters with the rotational phase of the neutron star. The width of the CRSF could only be constrained for the brighter observation. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of CRSF formation in single accretion columns, its pulse phase dependence supports a simplified fan beam emission pattern. The evolution of the CRSF width is very similar to that of the CRSF depth, which is, however, in disagreement with expectations.

Direct measurements of meltwater runoff on the Greenland ice sheet surface	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						ice sheet meltwater runoff; surface mass balance; climate models; fluvial catchment; surface water hydrology	WEST GREENLAND; MASS-BALANCE; SUBGLACIAL DRAINAGE; ABLATION ZONE; ENERGY-BALANCE; MELT; GLACIER; VARIABILITY; HYDROLOGY; FLOW	Meltwater runoff from the Greenland ice sheet surface influences surface mass balance (SMB), ice dynamics, and global sea level rise, but is estimated with climate models and thus difficult to validate. We present a way to measure ice surface runoff directly, from hourly in situ supraglacial river discharge measurements and simultaneous high-resolution satellite/drone remote sensing of upstream fluvial catchment area. A first 72-h trial for a 63.1-km2 moulin-terminating internally drained catchment (IDC) on Greenland's midelevation (1,2071,381 m above sea level) ablation zone is compared with melt and runoff simulations from HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, MERRA-2, and SEB climate/SMB models. Current models cannot reproduce peak discharges or timing of runoff entering moulins but are improved using synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH) theory. Retroactive SUH applications to two older field studies reproduce their findings, signifying that remotely sensed IDC area, shape, and supraglacial river length are useful for predicting delays in peak runoff delivery to moulins. Applying SUH to HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, and RACMO2.3 gridded melt products for 799 surrounding IDCs suggests their terminal moulins receive lower peak discharges, less diurnal variability, and asynchronous runoff timing relative to climate/SMB model output alone. Conversely, large IDCs produce high moulin discharges, even at high elevations where melt rates are low. During this particular field experiment, models overestimated runoff by + 21 to + 58%, linked to overestimated surface ablation and possible meltwater retention in bare, porous, low-density ice. Direct measurements of ice surface runoff will improve climate/SMB models, and incorporating remotely sensed IDCs will aid coupling of SMB with ice dynamics and subglacial systems.

Snowmelt response to simulated warming across a large elevation gradient, southern Sierra Nevada, California	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							WESTERN UNITED-STATES; SAN-FRANCISCO ESTUARY; ALPINE 3D MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER EQUIVALENT; FUTURE SNOW; CENTRAL SWITZERLAND; MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; CHANGING CLIMATE; ENERGY EXCHANGE	In a warmer climate, the fraction of annual meltwater produced at high melt rates in mountainous areas is projected to decline due to a contraction of the snow-cover season, causing melt to occur earlier and under lower energy conditions. How snowmelt rates, including extreme events relevant to flood risk, may respond to a range of warming over a mountain front is poorly known. We present a model sensitivity study of snowmelt response to warming across a 3600m elevation gradient in the southern Sierra Nevada, USA. A snow model was run for three distinct years and verified against extensive ground observations. To simulate the impact of climate warming on meltwater production, measured meteorological conditions were modified by + 1 to +6 degrees C. The total annual snow water volume exhibited linear reductions (-10% degrees C-1 /consistent with previous studies. However, the sensitivity of snowmelt rates to successive degrees of warming varied nonlinearly with elevation. Middle elevations and years with more snowfall were prone to the largest reductions in snowmelt rates, with lesser changes simulated at higher elevations. Importantly, simulated warming causes extreme daily snowmelt (99th percentiles) to increase in spatial extent and intensity, and shift from spring to winter. The results offer insight into the sensitivity of mountain snow water resources and how the rate and timing of water availability may change in a warmer climate. The identification of future climate conditions that may increase extreme melt events is needed to address the climate resilience of regional flood control systems.

Discovery of 40 New Galaxy-scale Strong Lenses	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						dark matter; galaxies: evolution; gravitational lensing: strong; methods: observational; techniques: image processing	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SPECTROSCOPICALLY SELECTED SAMPLE; INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; TO-LIGHT RATIOS; GRAVITATIONAL-LENS; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; DARK-MATTER; STELLAR MASS; SEMILINEAR INVERSION; FUNDAMENTAL PLANE	We present the full sample of 118 galaxy-scale strong-lens candidates in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey for the Masses (S4TM) Survey, which are spectroscopically selected from the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations confirm that 40 candidates are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The foreground-lens galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts 0.06-0.44, and background sources are emission-line galaxies at redshifts 0.22-1.29. As an extension of the SLACS Survey, the S4TM Survey is the first attempt to preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively lower lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens samples. By fitting HST data with a singular isothermal ellipsoid model, we find that the total projected mass within the Einstein radius of the S4TM strong-lens sample ranges from 3 x 10(10) M-circle dot to 2 x 10(11) M-circle dot. In Shu et al., we have derived the total stellar mass of the S4TM lenses to be 5 x 10(10) M-circle dot to 1 x 10(12) M-circle dot. Both the total enclosed mass and stellar mass of the S4TM lenses are on average almost a factor of 2 smaller than those of the SLACS lenses, which also represent the typical mass scales of the current strong-lens samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM sample can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for transitions in scaling relations, kinematic properties, mass structure, and dark-matter content trends of ETGs at intermediate-mass scales as noted in previous studies.

Hubble Space Telescope Scattered-light Imaging and Modeling of the Edge-on Protoplanetary Disk ESO-H alpha 569	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; radiative transfer	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; 2-DIMENSIONAL RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; STAR-FORMING REGION; LOW-MASS STARS; T-TAURI STARS; CHAMELEON-I; CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; PROTOSTELLAR ENVELOPES; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS	We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys observations and detailed models for a recently discovered edge-on protoplanetary disk around ESO-H alpha. 569 (a low-mass T Tauri star in the Cha I star-forming region). Using radiative transfer models, we probe the distribution of the grains and overall shape of the disk (inclination, scale height, dust mass, flaring exponent, and surface/ volume density exponent) by model fitting to multiwavelength (F606W and F814W) HST observations together with a literature-compiled spectral energy distribution. A new tool set was developed for finding optimal fits of MCFOST radiative transfer models using the MCMC code emcee to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space. It is able to selfconsistently and simultaneously fit a wide variety of observables in order to place constraints on the physical properties of a given disk, while also rigorously assessing the uncertainties in those derived properties. We confirm that ESO-H alpha. 569 is an optically thick nearly edge-on protoplanetary disk. The shape of the disk is well-described by a flared disk model with an exponentially tapered outer edge, consistent with models previously advocated on theoretical grounds and supported by millimeter interferometry. The scattered-light images and spectral energy distribution are best fit by an unusually high total disk mass (gas+ dust assuming a ratio of 100: 1) with a disk-tostar mass ratio of 0.16.

J	Wang, KN; Juarez, MD; Ao, CO; Xie, FQ				Wang, Kuo-Nung; Juarez, Manuel de la Torre; Ao, Chi O.; Xie, Feiqin			Correcting negatively biased refractivity below ducts in GNSS radio occultation: an optimal estimation approach towards improving planetary boundary layer (PBL) characterization	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							WATER-VAPOR; PRECIPITABLE WATER; LOWER TROPOSPHERE; GPS OCCULTATION; SUPERREFRACTION; ATMOSPHERE; PACIFIC; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; CHAMP	Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) measurements are promising in sensing the vertical structure of the Earth's planetary boundary layer (PBL). However, large refractivity changes near the top of PBL can cause ducting and lead to a negative bias in the retrieved refractivity within the PBL (below similar to 2 km). To remove the bias, a reconstruction method with assumption of linear structure inside the ducting layer models has been proposed by Xie et al. (2006). While the negative bias can be reduced drastically as demonstrated in the simulation, the lack of high-quality surface refractivity constraint makes its application to real RO data difficult. In this paper, we use the widely available precipitable water (PW) satellite observation as the external constraint for the bias correction. A new framework is proposed to incorporate optimization into the RO reconstruction retrievals in the presence of ducting conditions. The new method uses optimal estimation to select the best refractivity solution whose PW and PBL height best match the externally retrieved PW and the known a priori states, respectively. The near-coincident PW retrievals from AMSR-E microwave radiometer instruments are used as an external observational constraint. This new reconstruction method is tested on both the simulated GNSS-RO profiles and the actual GNSS-RO data. Our results show that the proposed method can greatly reduce the negative refractivity bias when compared to the traditional Abel inversion.

Constraints on the near-Earth asteroid obliquity distribution from the Yarkovsky effect	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						methods: statistical; celestial mechanics; minor planets, asteroids: general	29075 1950 DA; 99942 APOPHIS; DENSITY; MODELS	Aims. From light curve and radar data we know the spin axis of only 43 near-Earth asteroids. In this paper we attempt to constrain the spin axis obliquity distribution of near-Earth asteroids by leveraging the Yarkovsky effect and its dependence on an asteroid's obliquity. Methods. By modeling the physical parameters driving the Yarkovsky effect, we solve an inverse problem where we test different simple parametric obliquity distributions. Each distribution results in a predicted Yarkovsky effect distribution that we compare with a chi(2) test to a dataset of 125 Yarkovsky estimates. Results. We find different obliquity distributions that are statistically satisfactory. In particular, among the considered models, the best-fit solution is a quadratic function, which only depends on two parameters, favors extreme obliquities consistent with the expected outcomes from the YORP effect, has a 2: 1 ratio between retrograde and direct rotators, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions, and is statistically consistent with the distribution of known spin axes of near-Earth asteroids.

Demonstration of acoustic source localization in air using single pixel compressive imaging	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								Acoustic source localization often relies on large sensor arrays that can be electronically complex and have large data storage requirements to process element level data. Recently, the concept of a single-pixel-imager has garnered interest in the electromagnetics literature due to its ability to form high quality images with a single receiver paired with shaped aperture screens that allow for the collection of spatially orthogonal measurements. Here, we present a method for creating an acoustic analog to the single-pixel-imager found in electromagnetics for the purpose of source localization. Additionally, diffraction is considered to account for screen openings comparable to the acoustic wavelength. A diffraction model is presented and incorporated into the single pixel framework. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying single pixel localization to acoustic measurements. The method is experimentally validated with laboratory measurements made in an air waveguide.

The SPARC water vapor assessment II: intercomparison of satellite and ground-based microwave measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MILLIMETER-WAVE SPECTROMETER; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; RETRIEVAL; TEMPERATURE; VALIDATION; STRATOSPHERE; INSTRUMENTS; RADIOMETER; TRANSPORT; CAMPAIGN	As part of the second SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate) water vapor assessment (WAVAS-II), we present measurements taken from or coincident with seven sites from which ground-based microwave instruments measure water vapor in the middle atmosphere. Six of the ground-based instruments are part of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) and provide datasets that can be used for drift and trend assessment. We compare measurements from these ground-based instruments with satellite datasets that have provided retrievals of water vapor in the lower mesosphere over extended periods since 1996. We first compare biases between the satellite and ground-based instruments from the upper stratosphere to the upper mesosphere. We then show a number of time series comparisons at 0.46 hPa, a level that is sensitive to changes in H2O and CH4 entering the stratosphere but, because almost all CH4 has been oxidized, is relatively insensitive to dynamical variations. Interannual variations and drifts are investigated with respect to both the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS; from 2004 onwards) and each instrument's climatological mean. We find that the variation in the interannual difference in the mean H2O measured by any two instruments is typically similar to 1%. Most of the datasets start in or after 2004 and show annual increases in H2O of 0-1% yr(-1). In particular, MLS shows a trend of between 0.5% yr(-1) and 0.7% yr(-1) at the comparison sites. However, the two longest measurement datasets used here, with measurements back to 1996, show much smaller trends of +0.1% yr(-1) (at Mauna Loa, Hawaii) and -0.1% yr(-1) (at Lauder, New Zealand).

They run on high-performance architectures that are significantly different from the everyday environments that scientists use to pre-and post-process results (i.e., MATLAB, Python). This results in models that are hard to use for non-specialists and are increasingly specific in their application. It also makes them relatively inaccessible to the wider science community, not to mention to the general public. Here, we present a new software/model paradigm that attempts to bridge the gap between the science community and the complexity of ESMs by developing a new JavaScript application program interface (API) for the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). The aforementioned API allows cryosphere scientists to run ISSM on the client side of a web page within the JavaScript environment. When combined with a web server running ISSM (using a Python API), it enables the serving of ISSM computations in an easy and straightforward way. The deep integration and similarities between all the APIs in ISSM (MATLAB, Python, and now JavaScript) significantly shortens and simplifies the turnaround of state-of-the-art science runs and their use by the larger community. We demonstrate our approach via a new Virtual Earth System Laboratory (VESL) website (http:// vesl. jpl. nasa. gov, VESL, 2017).

Available in near-real time (NRT) and with a record dating back to 1999, MISR CMVs boast pole-to-pole coverage and geometric height assignment that is complementary to the suite of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) included in the MERRA-2 standard. Experiments spanning September-November of 2014 and March-May of 2015 estimated relative MISR CMV impact on the 24-h forecast error reduction with an adjoint-based forecast sensitivity method. MISR CMV were more consistently beneficial and provided twice as large a mean forecast benefit when larger uncertainties were assigned to the less accurate component of the CMV oriented along the MISR satellite ground track, as opposed to when equal uncertainties were assigned to the eastward and northward components as in previous studies. Assimilating only the cross-track component provided 60% of the benefit of both components. When optimally assimilated, MISR CMV proved broadly beneficial throughout the Earth, with the greatest benefit evident at high latitudes where there is a confluence of more frequent CMV coverage and gaps in coverage from other MERRA-2 wind observations. Globally, MISR represented 1.6% of the total forecast benefit, whereas regionally that percentage was as large as 3.7%.

Scott			Empirical Bolometric Fluxes and Angular Diameters of 1.6 Million Tycho-2 Stars and Radii of 350,000 Stars with Gaia DR1 Parallaxes	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; stars: fundamental parameters		We present bolometric fluxes and angular diameters for over 1.6 million stars in the Tycho-2 catalog, determined using previously determined empirical color-temperature and color-flux relations. We vet these relations via full fits to the full broadband spectral energy distributions for a subset of benchmark stars and perform quality checks against the large set of stars for which spectroscopically determined parameters are available from LAMOST, RAVE, and/or APOGEE. We then estimate radii for the 355,502 Tycho-2 stars in our sample whose Gaia DR1 parallaxes are precise to less than or similar to 10%. For these stars, we achieve effective temperature, bolometric flux, and angular diameter uncertainties of the order of 1%-2% and radius uncertainties of order 8%, and we explore the effect that imposing spectroscopic effective temperature priors has on these uncertainties. These stellar parameters are shown to be reliable for stars with T-eff less than or similar to 7000 K. The over half a million bolometric fluxes and angular diameters presented here will serve as an immediate trove of empirical stellar radii with the Gaia second data release, at which point effective temperature uncertainties will dominate the radius uncertainties. Already, dwarf, subgiant, and giant populations are readily identifiable in our purely empirical luminosity-effective temperature (theoretical) Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams.

In this context, molecular data have been continuously providing observational constraints on the gas dynamics at different excitation conditions and depths in the sources. We have investigated the Barnard 59 core, the only active site of star formation in the Pipe Nebula, to achieve a comprehensive view of the kinematic properties of the source. This information was derived by simultaneously fitting ammonia inversion transition lines (1, 1) and (2, 2). Our analysis unveils the imprint of protostellar feedback, such as increasing line widths, temperature, and turbulent motions in our molecular data. Combined with complementary observations of dust thermal emission, we estimate that the core is gravitationally bound following a virial analysis. If the core is not contracting, another source of internal pressure, most likely the magnetic field, is supporting it against gravitational collapse and limits its star formation efficiency.

Magnetic forces are possibly drivers of the flows, but ionization state estimates suggest that much of the gas mass decouples from magnetic fields. Thus, hydrodynamical instabilities could play a major role. We investigate disk dynamics under conditions typical for a T Tauri system, using global 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with embedded particles and a resolution of 70 cells per scale height. Stellar irradiation heating is included with realistic dust opacities. The disk starts in joint radiative balance and hydrostatic equilibrium. The vertical shear instability (VSI) develops into turbulence that persists up to at least 1600 inner orbits (143 outer orbits). Turbulent speeds are a few percent of the local sound speed at the midplane, increasing to 20%, or 100 m s(-1), in the corona. These are consistent with recent upper limits on turbulent speeds from optically thin and thick molecular line observations of TW Hya and HD 163296. The predominantly vertical motions induced by the VSI efficiently lift particles upward. Grains 0.1 and 1 mm in size achieve scale heights greater than expected in isotropic turbulence. We conclude that while kinematic constraints from molecular line emission do not directly discriminate between magnetic and nonmagnetic disk models, the small dust scale heights measured in HL Tau and HD 163296 favor turbulent magnetic models, which reach lower ratios of the vertical kinetic energy density to the accretion stress.

ALMA Band 6 observations trace the bulk of the molecular gas in (CO)-C-12(2-1) and the high column density regions in (CO)-C-13(2-1). Our target is a quiescent cloud (PGCC G282.98-32.40, which we refer to as the "Planck cold cloud" or PCC) in the southern outskirts of the galaxy where star formation activity is very low and largely confined to one location. We decompose the cloud into structures using a dendrogram and apply an identical analysis to matched-resolution cubes of the 30 Doradus molecular cloud (located near intense star formation) for comparison. Structures in the PCC exhibit roughly 10 times lower surface density and five times lower velocity dispersion than comparably sized structures in 30 Dor, underscoring the non-universality of molecular cloud properties. In both clouds, structures with relatively higher surface density lie closer to simple virial equilibrium, whereas lower surface-density structures tend to exhibit supervirial line widths. In the PCC, relatively high line widths are found in the vicinity of an infrared source whose properties are consistent with a luminous young stellar object. More generally, we find that the smallest resolved structures ("leaves") of the dendrogram span close to the full range of line widths observed across all scales. As a result, while the bulk of the kinetic energy is found on the largest scales, the small-scale energetics tend to be dominated by only a few structures, leading to substantial scatter in observed size-line-width relationships.

Investigating the Evolution of the Dual AGN System ESO 509-IG066	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (ESO 509-IG066); galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; INFRARED-SURVEY-EXPLORER; ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEM; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; HOST GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; EMISSION-LINES; QUASARS; KECK	We analyze the evolution of the dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) in ESO 509-IG066, a galaxy pair located at z = 0.034 whose nuclei are separated by 11 kpc. Previous observations with XMM-Newton on this dual AGN found evidence for two moderately obscured (N-H similar to 1022 cm(-2)) X-ray luminous (L-X similar to 10(43) erg s(-1)) nuclear sources. We present an analysis of subsequent Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift/XRT observations that show one source has dropped in flux by a factor of 10 between 2004 and 2011, which could be explained by either an increase in the absorbing column or an intrinsic fading of the central engine, possibly due to a decrease in mass accretion. Both of these scenarios are predicted by galaxy merger simulations. The source that has dropped in flux is not detected by NuSTAR, which argues against absorption, unless it is extreme. However, new Keck/LRIS optical spectroscopy reveals a previously unreported broad Ha line that is highly unlikely to be visible under the extreme absorption scenario. We therefore conclude that the black hole in this nucleus has undergone a dramatic drop in its accretion rate. From AO-assisted near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy of the other nucleus, we find evidence that the galaxy merger is having a direct effect on the kinematics of the gas close to the nucleus of the galaxy, providing a direct observational link between the galaxy merger and the mass accretion rate onto the black hole.

The bullet-outflow source is associated with a large pseudo-disk and three molecular outflows-a high-velocity outflow (HVO), a medium-velocity outflow (MVO), and a slow, extended outflow (SEO). The size (mass) of the pseudo-disk is 10,350 au x 6400 au (0.64-0.17 M-circle dot); from a model-fit assuming infall and rotation, we derive a central stellar mass of 8-19 M-circle dot. The HVO (MVO) has an angular size similar to 5180 (similar to 3330) au and a projected outflow velocity of similar to 140 km s(-1) (similar to 30 km s(-1)). The SEO size (outflow speed) is similar to 0.9 pc (similar to 6 km s(-1)). The HVO's axis is aligned with (orthogonal to) that of the SEO (pseudo-disk). The velocity structure of the MVO is unresolved. The scalar momenta in the HVO and SEO are very similar, suggesting that the SEO has resulted from the HVO interacting with ambient-cloud material. The bullet spray shares a common axis with the pseudo-disk and has an age comparable to that of MVO (few hundred years), suggesting that these three structures are intimately linked. We discuss several models for the outflows in IRAS 05506+2414 (including dynamical decay of a stellar cluster, chance encounter of a runaway star with a dense cloud, and close passage of two protostars), and conclude that second-epoch imaging to derive proper motions of the bullets and nearby stars can help to discriminate between them.

The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP)	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							SENSOR MICROWAVE IMAGER; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; WIND SPEEDS; TRENDS; PRECIPITATION; FEEDBACKS; PRODUCTS; SURFACE; BIASES; CYCLE	The Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path (MAC-LWP), an updated and enhanced version of the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) cloud liquid water path (CLWP) climatology, currently provides 29 years (1988-2016) of monthly gridded (1 degrees) oceanic CLWP information constructed using Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) intercalibrated 0.25 degrees-resolution retrievals. Satellite sources include SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, SSMIS, AMSR-2, and GMI. To mitigate spurious CLWP trends, the climatology is corrected for drifting satellite overpass times by simultaneously solving for the monthly average CLWP and the monthly mean diurnal cycle. In addition to a longer record and six additional satellite products, major enhancements relative to the UWisc climatology include updating the input to version 7 RSS retrievals, correcting for a CLWP bias (based on matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes), and constructing a total (cloud 1 rain) liquid water path (TLWP) record for use in analyses of columnar liquid water in raining clouds. Because the microwave emission signal from cloud water is similar to that of precipitation-sized hydrometeors, greater uncertainty in the CLWP record is expected in regions of substantial precipitation. Therefore, the TLWP field can also be used as a quality-control screen, where uncertainty increases as the ratio of CLWP to TLWP decreases. For regions where confidence in CLWP is highest (i.e., CLWP: TLWP > 0.8), systematic differences in MAC CLWP relative to UWisc CLWP range from -15% (e.g., global oceanic stratocumulus decks) to +15%-10% (e.g., portions of the higher latitudes, storm tracks, and shallower convection regions straddling the ITCZ). The dataset is currently hosted at the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center.

However, it is still unclear whether it is caused by biotic (e.g., plant structure damage) or environmental (e.g., water deficiency) factors. We used the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and radar backscatter observations from SeaWinds Scatterometer on board QuikSCAT (QSCAT) satellite to investigate the relative role of biotic and environmental factors in controlling the forest canopy disturbance and recovery processes after the 2005 Amazonian drought. We validated the CLM4.5 simulation of the drought impact and the recovery of leaf carbon (C) pool, an indicator of canopy structure, over southwestern Amazonia with QSCAT backscatter observations, which are sensitive to canopy structure change. We found that the leaf C pool simulated by CLM4.5 recovered to the 2000-2009 mean level (343 g C m(-2)) in 3 years after a sharp decrease in 2005, consistent with the QSCAT observed slow recovery. Through sensitivity experiments, we found that the slow C recovery was primarily due to biotic factors represented by the canopy damage and reduction of plant C pools. The recovery of soil water and the coupling between water and C pools, which is an environmental factor, only contributes similar to 24% to the leaf C recovery. The results showed (1) the strength of scatterometer backscatter measurements in capturing canopy damage over tropical forests and in validating C cycle models and (2) the biotic factors play the dominant role in regulating the drought induced disturbance and persistent canopy changes in CLM4.5.

These networks measure surface displacements and the amount of geodetic strain accumulated in the region and give insight into the seismic potential. SuGar (Sumatra GPS Array) in Sumatra, GEONET (GNSS Earth Observation Network System) in Japan, and PBO (Plate Boundary Observatory) in California are some examples of established networks around the world that are constantly expanding with the addition of new stations to improve the quality of measurements. However, installing new stations to existing networks is tedious and expensive. Therefore, it is important to choose suitable locations for new stations to increase the precision obtained in measuring the geophysical parameters of interest. Here we describe a methodology to design optimal geodetic networks that augment the existing system and use it to investigate seismo-tectonics at convergent and transform boundaries considering land-based and seafloor geodesy. The proposed network design optimization would be pivotal to better understand seismic and tsunami hazards around the world. Land-based and seafloor networks can monitor fault slip around subduction zones with significant resolution, but transform faults are more challenging to monitor due to their near-vertical geometry. Plain Language Summary Earthquakes and associated natural hazards expose a great number of people to significant risks. Despite tremendous efforts to precisely monitor fault activity, it is still challenging with the limited number of GNSS stations. In order to save cost and effort, we present a robust nonlinear optimization scheme to identify the optimal distribution of GNSS networks augmenting their current configuration. We explore the capacity of GNSS networks to monitor slip before, during, and after earthquakes to better prepare for anticipated ruptures and other aseismic fault activity. We realize a fundamental limitation of geodesy to monitor vertical strike-slip faults, motivating new complimentary ways to monitor these faults. Strong constraints on fault slip near the trench can be established using an extension of the GNSS data offshore, using sea geodesy. The proposed networks would allow monitoring of fault kinematics with improved accuracy.

We find that of the 24mm of uplift of the Sierra Nevada from October 2011 to October 2015, just 5mm is produced by Central Valley groundwater loss, less than 2mm is tectonic uplift, and 17mm is solid Earth's elastic response to water loss in the Sierra Nevada. We invert GPS vertical displacements recording solid Earth's elastic response to infer changes in water storage across the western U.S. from January 2006 to October 2017. We find water changes to be sustained over periods of drought or heavy precipitation: the Sierra Nevada lost 1519km(3) of water during drought from October 2006 to October 2009, gained 1814km(3) of water during heavy precipitation from October 2009 to October 2011, and lost 4521km(3) of water during severe drought from October 2011 to October 2015 (95% confidence limits). Such large changes are not in hydrology models: snow accumulation in October is negligible and long-term soil moisture change is small. We infer that there must be large loss of either deep soil moisture or groundwater in river alluvium and in crystalline basement in the Sierra Nevada. The results suggest there to be parching of water in the ground during the summer of years of drought and seeping of melting snow into the Sierra Nevada in the spring of years of heavy precipitation.

Global Regolith Thermophysical Properties of the Moon From the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Moon; lunar; regolith; thermal; Diviner; impacts	THERMAL INERTIA; PYROCLASTIC DEPOSITS; SURFACE TEMPERATURES; MARS; CRATER; CONDUCTIVITY; MODEL; STABILITY; ROUGHNESS; THICKNESS	We used infrared data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment to globally map thermophysical properties of the Moon's regolith fines layer. Thermal conductivity varies from 7.4x10(-4)Wm(-1)K(-1) at the surface to 3.4x10(-3)Wm(-1)K(-1) at depths of similar to 1m, given density values of 1,100kgm(-3) at the surface to 1,800kgm(-3) at 1m depth. On average, the scale height of these profiles is similar to 7cm, corresponding to a thermal inertia of 552Jm(-2)K(-1)s(-1/2) at 273K, relevant to the diurnally active near-surface layer, similar to 4-7cm. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity and heat capacity leads to an similar to 2 times diurnal variation in thermal inertia at the equator. On global scales, the regolith fines are remarkably uniform, implying rapid homogenization by impact gardening of this layer on timescales <1Gyr. Regional- and local-scale variations show prominent impact features <1Gyr old, including higher thermal inertia (> 100Jm(-2)K(-1)s(-1/2)) in the interiors and ejecta of Copernican-aged impact craters and lower thermal inertia (< 50Jm(-2)K(-1)s(-1/2)) within the lunar cold spots identified by Bandfield et al. (2014). Observed trends in ejecta thermal inertia provide a potential tool for age dating craters of previously unknown age, complementary to the approach suggested by Ghent et al. (2014). Several anomalous regions are identified in the global 128 pixels per degree maps presented here, including a high-thermal inertia deposit near the antipode of Tycho crater. Plain Language Summary We measured the Moon's temperature cycles with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's Diviner instrument to make the first global maps of important physical properties of the dusty surface layer. These maps reveal a rich new view of the last billion years of impact processes and volcanism on the Moon. Impacts by meteorites cause the breakdown of rocks and accumulation of regoliththe granular surface materials. Our results show that regolith formation is a rapid process, which homogenizes and redistributes fine particles over large distances. These new observations provide a wealth of data for future study and also suggest a new technique for determining the ages of craters on the Moon and other planetary surfaces, using temperatures to infer the depth of accumulated regolith.

Spectral Behavior of Irradiated Sodium Chloride Crystals Under Europa-Like Conditions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						planetary science; ocean worlds; Europa; astrobiology; irradiation processing; color centers	OCEAN WORLDS; CENTERS; LUMINESCENCE	F- and M-color center formation (decay) was observed during (after) irradiation of sodium chloride crystal grains with 10keV electrons as a function of temperature, radiation dose rate, and radiation dose. The F centers (peak center: 460nm) were found to form and decay at a faster rate than the M centers (peak center: 720nm). These effects were influenced by temperature and possibly by irradiation dose rate. Tracking the band depth ratio of the color center features during irradiation could enable age determination of geologically very young features on the surface of Europa and other icy ocean worlds. Plain Language Summary Does Jupiter's moon Europa have the right conditions for life? Europa is thought to have a sub-surface ocean of salty water. Sodium chloride at the surface is a likely sign of mixing between the surface and the sub-surface ocean. Such mixing would increase the likelihood of the sub-surface ocean supporting microbial life. Finding former ocean material very recently arrived at the surface would provide the best understanding of the ocean (short of directly sampling it). We performed experiments examining how sodium chloride visible light absorption changes in a simulated Europa surface environment. We found that by calculating the ratio of two main absorption features, called color centers, it is possible to determine the time since the sodium chloride arrived at the surface, up to twenty years at Europa.

The Vertical Dust Profile Over Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; atmosphere; dust; Curiosity; MSL; Gale Crater	MONITORING STATION OBSERVATIONS; SCIENCE LABORATORY ROVER; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; OPTICAL DEPTH; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; BOUNDARY-LAYER; STORMS; MODEL; REMS	We create a vertically coarse, but complete, profile of dust mixing ratio from the surface to the upper atmosphere over Gale Crater, Mars, using the frequent joint atmospheric observations of the orbiting Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) and the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. Using these data and an estimate of planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth from the MarsWRF general circulation model, we divide the vertical column into three regions. The first region is the Gale Crater PBL, the second is the MCS-sampled region, and the third is between these first two. We solve for a well-mixed dust mixing ratio within this third (middle) layer of atmosphere to complete the profile. We identify a unique seasonal cycle of dust within each atmospheric layer. Within the Gale PBL, dust mixing ratio maximizes near southern hemisphere summer solstice (L-s=270 degrees) and minimizes near winter solstice (L-s=90-100 degrees) with a smooth sinusoidal transition between them. However, the layer above Gale Crater and below the MCS-sampled region more closely follows the global opacity cycle and has a maximum in opacity near L-s=240 degrees and exhibits a local minimum (associated with the solsticial pause in dust storm activity) near L-s=270 degrees. With knowledge of the complete vertical dust profile, we can also assess the frequency of high-altitude dust layers over Gale. We determine that 36% of MCS profiles near Gale Crater contain an absolute high-altitude dust layer wherein the dust mixing ratio is the maximum in the entire vertical column.

Coherent Microwave Scattering Model of Marsh Grass	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article							BACKSCATTERING; DELTAS; WHEAT	In this work, we developed an electromagnetic scattering model to analyze radar scattering from tall-grass-covered lands such as wetlands and marshes. The model adopts the generalized iterative extended boundary condition method (GIEBCM) algorithm, previously developed for buried cylindrical media such as vegetation roots, to simulate the scattering from the grass layer. The major challenge of applying GIEBCM to tall grass is the extremely time-consuming iteration among the large number of short subcylinders building up the grass. To overcome this issue, we extended the GIEBCM to multilevel GIEBCM, or M-GIEBCM, in which we first use GIEBCM to calculate a T matrix (transition matrix) database of straws with various lengths, thicknesses, orientations, curvatures, and dielectric properties; we then construct the grass with a group of straws from the database and apply GIEBCM again to calculate the T matrix of the overall grass scene. The grass T matrix is transferred to S matrix (scattering matrix) and combined with the ground S matrix, which is computed using the stabilized extended boundary condition method, to obtain the total scattering. In this article, we will demonstrate the capability of the model by simulating scattering from scenes with different grass densities, different grass structures, different grass water contents, and different ground moisture contents. This model will help with radar experiment design and image interpretation for marshland and wetland observations.

Detecting Landscape Disturbance at the Nasca Lines Using SAR Data Collected from Airborne and Satellite Platforms	GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						nasca lines; UAVSAR; Sentinel-1; SAR interferometry (InSAR); disturbance; world heritage; archaeology; paracas; heritage management; pampas; geoglyphs	HERITAGE; COAST; PERU	We used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected over Peru's Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa World Heritage Site to detect and measure landscape disturbance threatening world-renowned archaeological features and ecosystems. We employed algorithms to calculate correlations between pairs of SAR returns, collected at different times, and generate correlation images. Landscape disturbances even on the scale of pedestrian travel are discernible in correlation images generated from airborne, L-band SAR. Correlation images derived from C-band SAR data collected by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellites also provide detailed landscape change information. Because the two Sentinel-1 satellites together have a repeat pass interval that can be as short as six days, products derived from their data can not only provide information on the location and degree of ground disturbance, but also identify a time window of about one to three weeks during which disturbance must have occurred. For Sentinel-1, this does not depend on collecting data in fine-beam modes, which generally sacrifice the size of the area covered for a higher spatial resolution. We also report on pixel value stretching for a visual analysis of SAR data, quantitative assessment of landscape disturbance, and statistical testing for significant landscape change.

A single channel algorithm is used for consistency among the estimated LST products, whereas the option of using emissivity from different sources provides flexibility for the algorithm's implementation to any area of interest. The Google Earth Engine (GEE), an advanced earth science data and analysis platform, allows the estimation of LST products for the globe, covering the time period from 1984 to present. To evaluate the method, the estimated LST products were compared against two reference datasets: (a) LST products derived from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), as higher-level products based on the temperature-emissivity separation approach; (b) Landsat LST data that have been independently produced, using different approaches. An overall RMSE (root mean square error) of 1.52 degrees C was observed and it was confirmed that the accuracy of the LST product is dependent on the emissivity; different emissivity sources provided different LST accuracies, depending on the surface cover. The LST products, for the full Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archives, are estimated on-the-fly and are available on-line via a web application.

From then on, many spaser designs have been proposed. However, all existing designs use closed resonators. In this work, we use cavity quantum electrodynamics analysis to theoretically demonstrate that it is possible to design an electric spaser with an open resonator or a closed resonator with much weak feedback in the extreme quantum limit in an all-carbon platform. A carbon nanotube quantum dot plays the role of a gain element, and Coulomb blockade is observed. Graphene nanoribbons are used as the resonator, and surface plasmon polariton field distribution with quantum electrodynamics features can be observed. From an engineering perspective, our work makes preparations for integrating spasers into nanocircuits and/or photodynamic therapy applications.

More than a quarter million in situ measurements coincident with satellite data were compiled. A portion of the data was randomly selected to train and validate the model. We have produced and made accessible nine years (2002-2011) of the partial pressure at 0.5 degrees and daily resolutions over the global oceans. The outputs are found to be sensitive to variability from intraseasonal to interannual time scales and from the equatorial to high-latitude oceans. They can capture known phenomena, such as, annual spring blooms at high latitudes, interannual episodes of El Nino, and westward propagation of tropical instability waves. The feasibility of using a single algorithm to map the partial pressure over global oceans for all seasons is demonstrated. The result is important for characterizing the sources and sinks of atmospheric greenhouse gas and ocean biogeochemistry. We discuss the significance of the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer in the consistent measurement of sea surface temperature, which is the main driver of ocean carbon dioxide change, in cold and warm waters, under clear and cloudy sky. The continuous and consistent coverage of the partial pressure over global ocean using space-based data is discussed.	[Liu, W.

Chemical analyses indicate that the ocean is salty(5) and is fed by ongoing hydrothermal activity(6-8). In order to explain these observations, an abnormally high heat power (>20 billion watts) is required, as well as a mechanism to focus endogenic activity at the south pole(9,10). Here, we show that more than 10 GW of heat can be generated by tidal friction inside the unconsolidated rocky core. Water transport in the tidally heated permeable core results in hot narrow upwellings with temperatures exceeding 363 K, characterized by powerful (1-5 GW) hotspots at the seafloor, particularly at the south pole. The release of heat in narrow regions favours intense interaction between water and rock, and the transport of hydrothermal products from the core to the plume sources. We are thus able to explain the main global characteristics of Enceladus: global ocean, strong dissipation, reduced ice-shell thickness at the south pole and seafloor activity. We predict that this endogenic activity can be sustained for tens of millions to billions of years.

An elevation of 0.1 light-seconds for the optical jet base in an accreting Galactic black hole system	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							X-RAY; XTE J1118+480; V404 CYG; VARIABILITY DATA; INTERNAL SHOCKS; GX 339-4; BINARIES; ENERGY; OUTBURST; RADIO	Relativistic plasma jets are observed in many systems that host accreting black holes. According to theory, coiled magnetic fields close to the black hole accelerate and collimate the plasma, leading to a jet being launched(1-3). Isolating emission from this acceleration and collimation zone is key to measuring its size and understanding jet formation physics. But this is challenging because emission from the jet base cannot easily be disentangled from other accreting components. Here, we show that rapid optical flux variations from an accreting Galactic black-hole binary are delayed with respect to X-rays radiated from close to the black hole by about 0.1 seconds, and that this delayed signal appears together with a brightening radio jet. The origin of these subsecond optical variations has hitherto been controversial(4-8). Not only does our work strongly support a jet origin for the optical variations but it also sets a characteristic elevation of less than or similar to 10(3) Schwarzschild radii for the main inner optical emission zone above the black hole(9), constraining both internal shock(10) and magnetohydrodynamic(11) models. Similarities with blazars(12,13) suggest that jet structure and launching physics could potentially be unified under mass-invariant models. Two of the best-studied jetted black-hole binaries show very similar optical lags(8,14,15), so this size scale may be a defining feature of such systems.	[Gandhi, P.; Altamirano, D.; Charles, P.

The local nanohertz gravitational-wave landscape from supermassive black hole binaries	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							TIMING ARRAY LIMITS; GALAXIES; EVOLUTION	Supermassive black hole binary systems form in galaxy mergers and reside in galactic nuclei with large and poorly constrained concentrations of gas and stars. These systems emit nanohertz gravitational waves that will be detectable by pulsar timing arrays. Here we estimate the properties of the local nanohertz gravitational-wave landscape that includes individual supermassive black hole binaries emitting continuous gravitational waves and the gravitational-wave background that they generate. Using the 2 Micron All-Sky Survey, together with galaxy merger rates from the Illustris simulation project, we find that there are on average 91 +/- 7 continuous nanohertz gravitational-wave sources, and 7 +/- 2 binaries that will never merge, within 225 Mpc. These local unresolved gravitational-wave sources can generate a departure from an isotropic gravitational-wave background at a level of about 20 per cent, and if the cosmic gravitational-wave background can be successfully isolated, gravitational waves from at least one local supermassive black hole binary could be detected in 10 years with pulsar timing arrays.

Determining the mass, rotation state, and density distribution is an important task of the navigation team on an operational mission. One representation of the internal density distribution, spherical harmonics, may be leveraged to compute the orientation of the principal-axis frame of the celestial body, which in turn informs the dynamics of the body's motion. Particularly, the moments of inertia uniquely determine the second-degree spherical harmonic coefficients. Using data from NASA's Dawn mission to the massive asteroids Ceres and Vesta, a method is proposed that refines the knowledge of the principal-axis frame by using estimated spherical harmonic coefficients. Applying an iterative rotation scheme to the solved-for body-fixed frame leads to convergence on the dynamical principal-axis frame.

We analyze the effect of frequency modulation (FM) rate error in focusing on the DDI phase with an emphasis on the azimuth direction. We first comprehensively analyze the errors in various focusing results caused by the FM rate error. We then derive the DDI phase error considering different acquisition modes including stripmap, ScanSAR, and TOPS modes. For stripmap mode, typical DDI phase error is a range ramp, while for burst modes including ScanSAR and TOPS modes it is an azimuth ramp within a burst. The correction methods for the DDI phase error are suggested for different acquisition modes.

Managing Spacecraft Memory Buffers with Concurrent Data Collection and Downlink	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							ROSETTA MISSION	Space mission planning/scheduling is determining the set of spacecraft activities to meet mission objectives while respecting mission constraints. One important category of mission constraints is data management. As the spacecraft acquires data via science instruments and engineering telemetry, it must store the data on board until it is able to downlink the data to ground communications stations. Because onboard storage and communication opportunities are often limited, this can be a challenging task. This paper first describes the general problem of onboard memory management for spacecraft that allow concurrent data collection and downlink activities. Then, a fast, intuitive heuristic is presented for solving this problem, and its use on the Rosetta comet rendezvous mission is evaluated. Finally, different local heuristics are compared for a greedy search to a global graph-based solution, measuring performance in terms of runtime and robustness to downlink buffer overflow. The results show that local heuristics can produce solutions that are comparable, and often better than, solutions from a global formulation.

The Broadband and Spectrally Resolved H-band Eclipse of KELT-1b and the Role of Surface Gravity in Stratospheric Inversions in Hot Jupiters	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						brown dwarfs; planets and satellites: atmospheres; techniques: imaging spectroscopy	EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERES; EMISSION-SPECTRUM; SECONDARY ECLIPSE; GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; LIGHT CURVES; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURE; 209458B; 189733B	We present a high-precision H-band emission spectrum of the transiting brown dwarf KELT-1b, which we spectrophotometrically observed during a single secondary eclipse using the LUCI1 multiobject spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. Using a Gaussian-process regression model, we are able to clearly measure the broadband eclipse depth as Delta H = 1418 +/- 94 ppm. We are also able to spectrally resolve the H band into five separate wave channels and measure the eclipse spectrum of KELT-1b at R approximate to 50 with an average precision of +/- 135 ppm. We find that the day side has an average brightness temperature of 3250 +/- 50 K, with significant variation as a function of wavelength. Based on our observations and previous measurements of KELT-1b's eclipse at other wavelengths, we find that KELT-1b's day side appears identical to an isolated 3200 K brown dwarf, and our modeling of the atmospheric emission shows a monotonically decreasing temperature-pressure profile. This is in contrast to hot Jupiters with similar day-side brightness temperatures near 3000 K, all of which appear to be either isothermal or possess a stratospheric temperature inversion. We hypothesize that the lack of an inversion in KELT-1b is due to its high surface gravity, which we argue could be caused by the increased efficiency of cold-trap processes within its atmosphere.

No new substellar companions were discovered in our survey of 30 Spitzer-selected targets. We combine our observations with data from four published surveys to place constraints on the frequency of planets around 130 debris disk single stars, the largest sample to date. For a control sample, we assembled contrast curves from several published surveys targeting 277 stars that do not show infrared excesses. We assumed a double power-law distribution in mass and semimajor axis (SMA) of the form f(m, a) = Cm(alpha)a(beta), where we adopted power-law values and logarithmically flat values for the mass and SMA of planets. We find that the frequency of giant planets with masses 5-20 M-Jup and separations 10-1000 au around stars with debris disks is 6.27% (68% confidence interval 3.68%-9.76%), compared to 0.73% (68% confidence interval 0.20%-1.80%) for the control sample of stars without disks. These distributions differ at the 88% confidence level, tentatively suggesting distinctness of these samples.

The origin and the evolution of the organic matter on the early Earth is not yet firmly understood. Several hypothesis, possibly complementary, are considered. They can be divided in two categories: endogenous and exogenous sources. In this work we investigate the contribution of a specific endogenous source: the organic chemistry occurring in the ionosphere of the early Earth where the significant VUV contribution of the young Sun involved an efficient formation of reactive species. We address the issue whether this chemistry can lead to the formation of complex organic compounds with CO2 as only source of carbon in an early atmosphere made of N-2, CO2 and H-2, by mimicking experimentally this type of chemistry using a low pressure plasma reactor. By analyzing the gaseous phase composition, we strictly identified the formation of H2O, NH3, N2O and C2N2. The formation of,a solid organic phase is also observed, confirming the possibility to trigger organic chemistry in the upper atmosphere of the early Earth. The identification of Nitrogen-bearing chemical functions in the solid highlights the possibility for an efficient ionospheric chemistry to provide prebiotic material on the early Earth.

Synthetic Aperature LADAR: A Model-Based Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL IMAGING			English	Article						Model-based iterative reconstruction; maximum a posteriori estimate; synthetic aperture LADAR; speckle reduction	APERTURE LADAR; EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; HIGH-RESOLUTION; RADAR; DEMONSTRATIONS; RECONSTRUCTION; AUTOFOCUS	Synthetic aperture LADAR (SAL) allows high resolution imaging of distant objects. Basic SAL image processing is based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques originally developed for use in radar. These techniques can amplify noise and limit resolution. More advanced reconstruction techniques have been proposed for synthetic aperture radar (SAR), but have not been adapted for SAL. In addition, both conventional SAL and advanced SAR algorithms reconstruct the complex-valued reflection coefficient instead of the real-valued reflectance which leads to speckled images. In this paper, we present a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm designed specifically for SAL. Rather than estimating the reflection coefficient, we propose estimating its variance which is equal to the reflectance, a function that more closely resembles conventional optical images. A Bayesian framework is used to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for the reflectance using aQ-Generalized Gaussian Markov random field (QGGMRF) prior model. The QGGMRF is able to model complex correlations between neighboring pixels which promotes a smooth and more natural looking image. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to derive a surrogate for the MAP cost function. Finally, the proposed MBIR algorithm is tested on both simulated and experimental data. Results show significant and consistent improvements over existing reconstruction techniques in terms of image contrast, speckle reduction, autofocus, and low signal-to-noise ratio performance.

This produces a dipolar pattern of magnification, primarily as a consequence of the Doppler effect. At low redshift, this Doppler magnification completely dominates the usual integrated gravitational lensing contribution to the lensing magnification. We show that one can optimally observe this pattern by extracting the dipole in the cross-correlation of number counts and galaxy sizes. This dipole allows us to almost completely remove the contribution from gravitational lensing up to redshift less than or similar to 0.5, and even at high redshift z similar or equal to 1, the dipole picks up the Doppler magnification predominantly. Doppler magnification should be easily detectable in current and upcoming optical and radio surveys; by forecasting for telescopes such as the SKA, we show that this technique is competitive with using peculiar velocities via redshift-space distortions to constrain dark energy. It produces similar yet complementary constraints on the cosmological model to those found using measurements of the cosmic shear.

We find that the discontinuous feature was produced by a planetary companion to the binary lens. We find four degenerate triplelens solution classes, each composed of a pair of solutions according to the well-known wide/close planetary degeneracy. One of these solution classes is excluded due to its relatively poor fit. For the remaining three pairs of solutions, the most-likely primary mass is about M-1 similar to 0.7M(circle dot) , while the planet is a super Jupiter. In all cases, the system lies in the Galactic disk, about halfway toward the Galactic bulge. However, in one of these three solution classes, the secondary of the binary system is a low- mass brown dwarf, with relative mass ratios (1: 0.03: 0.003), while in the two others the masses of the binary components are comparable. These two possibilities can be distinguished in about 2024 when the measured lens-source relative proper motion will permit separate resolution of the lens and source.

The Effects of Protostellar Disk Turbulence on CO Emission Lines: A Comparison Study of Disks with Constant CO Abundance versus Chemically Evolving Disks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; astrochemistry; line: profiles; protoplanetary disks; turbulence	PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; INSTABILITY; FRAGMENTATION; SIMULATIONS; COAGULATION; PHYSICS	Turbulence is the leading candidate for angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks and therefore influences disk lifetimes and planet formation timescales. However, the turbulent properties of protoplanetary disks are poorly constrained observationally. Recent studies have found turbulent speeds smaller than what fullydeveloped MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H-2 ratio of 10(-4) in locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated. Our previous studies of evolving disk chemistry indicate that CO is depleted by incorporation into complex organic molecules well inside the freeze-out radius of CO. We consider the effects of this chemical depletion on measurements of turbulence. Simon et al. suggested that the ratio of the peak line flux to the flux at line center of the CO J = 3-2 transition is a reasonable diagnostic of turbulence, so we focus on that metric, while adding some analysis of the more complex effects on spatial distribution. We simulate the emission lines of CO based on chemical evolution models presented in Yu et al., and find that the peak-to-trough ratio changes as a function of time as CO is destroyed. Specifically, a CO-depleted disk with high turbulent velocity mimics the peak-to-trough ratios of a non-CO-depleted disk with lower turbulent velocity. We suggest that disk observers and modelers take into account the possibility of CO depletion when using line profiles or peak-to-trough ratios to constrain the degree of turbulence in disks. Assuming that CO/H-2 = 10(-4) at all disk radii can lead to underestimates of turbulent speeds in the disk by at least 0.2 km s(-1).

The combination of high-cadence, deep, wide-field optical photometry from LSST with highresolution, wide-field optical photometry, and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from Euclid will be powerful for addressing a wide range of astrophysical questions. We explore Euclid/ LSST synergy, ignoring the political issues associated with data access to focus on the scientific, technical, and financial benefits of coordination. We focus primarily on dark energy cosmology, but also discuss galaxy evolution, transient objects, solar system science, and galaxy cluster studies. We concentrate on synergies that require coordination in cadence or survey overlap, or would benefit from pixellevel co-processing that is beyond the scope of what is currently planned, rather than scientific programs that could be accomplished only at the catalog level without coordination in data processing or survey strategies. We provide two quantitative examples of scientific synergies: the decrease in photo-z errors (benefiting many science cases) when highresolution Euclid data are used for LSST photo-z determination, and the resulting increase in weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratio from smaller photo-z errors. We briefly discuss other areas of coordination, including high-performance computing resources and calibration data. Finally, we address concerns about the loss of independence and potential cross-checks between the two missions and the potential consequences of not collaborating.

Finite temperature thermodynamic properties of the Yb-Ni intermetallic compounds are predicted using the quasi-harmonic approach, where first-principles phonon calculations are performed to calculate the lattice vibrational entropy. The associate solution model is used to describe the complex thermodynamic behavior of the liquid phase. The calculated phase diagram agrees well the experimental phase equilibrium data in the literature. By the coupling of CALPHAD modeling with first-principles calculations, the present work provides a more thermodynamically accurate model of the Yb-Ni system when compared to previous models.

Single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction show that Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 crystallizes in the cubic space group Pm (3) over barn (no. 223). Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 is the first representative of anionic clathrates whose framework is composed of three atom types of very different chemical natures: a transition metal, tetrel element, and pnicogen. Uniform distribution of the Cu, Ge, and P atoms over the framework sites and the absence of any superstructural or local ordering in Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 were confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and neutron and X-ray pair distribution function analyses. Characterization of the transport properties demonstrate that Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 is a p-type semiconductor with an intrinsically low thermal conductivity of 0.72 W m(-1) K-1 at 812 K. The thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, for a slice of the Bridgman-grown crystal of Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 approaches 0.63 at 812 K due to a high power factor of 5.62 mu W cm(-1) K-2. The thermoelectric efficiency of Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 is on par with the best optimized p-type Ge-based clathrates and outperforms the majority of clathrates in the 700-850 K temperature region, including all tetrel-free clathrates. Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 expands clathrate chemistry by bridging conventional tetrel-based and tetrel-free clathrates. Advanced transport properties, in combination with earth-abundant framework elements and congruent melting make Ba8Cu14Ge6P26 a strong candidate as a novel and efficient thermoelectric material.

A real-time ocean reanalyses intercomparison project in the context of tropical pacific observing system and ENSO monitoring	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Ocean reanalysis intercomparison; Ocean data assimilation system; Ocean initialization; Tropical Pacific observing system; TAO/TRITON; ENSO monitoring and prediction; Argo floats; Ensemble approach; Signal to noise ratio	HEAT-CONTENT VARIABILITY; IMPROVED COUPLED MODEL; DATA ASSIMILATION; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; EL-NINO; SEASONAL FORECASTS; MIXED-LAYER; ENSEMBLE; INITIALIZATION; TEMPERATURE	An ensemble of nine operational ocean reanalyses (ORAs) is now routinely collected, and is used to monitor the consistency across the tropical Pacific temperature analyses in real-time in support of ENSO monitoring, diagnostics, and prediction. The ensemble approach allows a more reliable estimate of the signal as well as an estimation of the noise among analyses. The real-time estimation of signal-to-noise ratio assists the prediction of ENSO. The ensemble approach also enables us to estimate the impact of the Tropical Pacific Observing System (TPOS) on the estimation of ENSO-related oceanic indicators. The ensemble mean is shown to have a better accuracy than individual ORAs, suggesting the ensemble approach is an effective tool to reduce uncertainties in temperature analysis for ENSO. The ensemble spread, as a measure of uncertainties in ORAs, is shown to be partially linked to the data counts of in situ observations. Despite the constraints by TPOS data, uncertainties in ORAs are still large in the northwestern tropical Pacific, in the SPCZ region, as well as in the central and northeastern tropical Pacific. The uncertainties in total temperature reduced significantly in 2015 due to the recovery of the TAO/TRITON array to approach the value before the TAO crisis in 2012. However, the uncertainties in anomalous temperature remained much higher than the pre-2012 value, probably due to uncertainties in the reference climatology. This highlights the importance of the long-term stability of the observing system for anomaly monitoring. The current data assimilation systems tend to constrain the solution very locally near the buoy sites, potentially damaging the larger-scale dynamical consistency. So there is an urgent need to improve data assimilation systems so that they can optimize the observation information from TPOS and contribute to improved ENSO prediction.

Process-oriented diagnostics include the Relative Humidity Composite based on Precipitation (RHCP), Normalized Gross Moist Stability (NGMS), and the Greenhouse Enhancement Factor (GEF). Numerous scalar metrics are developed to quantify the results. Most CMIP5 models underestimate MJO amplitude, especially when outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is used in the evaluation, and exhibit too fast phase speed while lacking coherence between eastward propagation of precipitation/convection and the wind field. The RHCP-metric, indicative of the sensitivity of simulated convection to low-level environmental moisture, and the NGMS-metric, indicative of the efficiency of a convective atmosphere for exporting moist static energy out of the column, show robust correlations with a large number of MJO skill metrics. The GEF-metric, indicative of the strength of the column-integrated longwave radiative heating due to cloud-radiation interaction, is also correlated with the MJO skill metrics, but shows relatively lower correlations compared to the RHCP- and NGMS-metrics. Our results suggest that modifications to processes associated with moisture-convection coupling and the gross moist stability might be the most fruitful for improving simulations of the MJO. Though the GEF-metric exhibits lower correlations with the MJO skill metrics, the longwave radiation feedback is highly relevant for simulating the weak precipitation anomaly regime that may be important for the establishment of shallow convection and the transition to deep convection.

In particular, the review is focused on large-scale modelling of the ice sheet, including future projections, model parameterisations, paleo applications and coupling with models of other components of the Earth system. Recent Findings Data assimilation techniques have been used to improve the reliability of model simulations of the Greenland ice sheet dynamics, including more accurate initial states, more comprehensive use of remote sensing as well as paleo observations and inclusion of additional physical processes. Summary Modellers now leverage the increasing number of high-resolution satellite and air-borne data products to initialise ice sheet models for centennial time-scale simulations, needed for policy relevant sea-level projections. Modelling long-term past and future ice sheet evolution, which requires simplified but adequate representations of the interactions with the other components of the Earth system, has seen a steady improvement. Important developments are underway to include ice sheets in climate models that may lead to routine simulation of the fully coupled Greenland ice sheet-climate system in the coming years.

J	Asay-Davis, XS; Jourdain, NC; Nakayama, Y				Asay-Davis, Xylar S.; Jourdain, Nicolas C.; Nakayama, Yoshihiro			Developments in Simulating and Parameterizing Interactions Between the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Ice Sheet	CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS			English	Article						Antarctica; Ice shelves; Ice sheet-ocean interactions; Ocean modeling; Marine ice sheet modeling; Icebergs		Recent advances in both ocean modeling and melt parameterization in ice-sheet models point the way toward coupled ice sheet-ocean modeling, which is needed to quantify Antarctic mass loss and the resulting sea-level rise. The latest Antarctic ocean modeling shows that complex interactions between the atmosphere, sea ice, icebergs, bathymetric features, and ocean circulation on many scales determine which water masses reach ice-shelf cavities and how much heat is available to melt ice. Meanwhile, parameterizations of basal melting in standalone ice-sheet models have evolved from simplified, depth-dependent functions to more sophisticated models, accounting for ice-shelf basal topography, and the evolution of the sub-ice-shelf buoyant flow. The focus of recent work has been on better understanding processes or adding new model capabilities, but a broader community effort is needed in validating models against observations and producing melt-rate projections. Given time, community efforts in coupled ice sheet-ocean modeling, already underway, will tackle the considerable challenges involved in building, initializing, constraining, and performing projections with coupled models, leading to reduced uncertainties in Antarctica's contribution to future sea-level rise.

Evaluating links between deformation, topography and surface temperature at volcanic domes: Results from a multi-sensor study at Volcan de Colima, Mexico	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						volcano dome; InSAR time series; deformation; infrared; degassing and cooling; Colima	SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO; LAVA DOME; MAGMA; PERMEABILITY; SUBSIDENCE; COLLAPSE; ERUPTION; GROWTH; FIELD; CRYSTALLIZATION	Dome building activity is common at many volcanoes and due to the gravitational instability, a dome represents one of the most hazardous volcanic phenomena. Shallow volcanic processes as well as rheological and structural changes of the dome affecting the fluid transport have been linked to transitions in eruptive activity. Also, hydrothermal alteration may affect the structural integrity of the dome, increasing the potential for collapse. However, mapping the deformation and details of fluid escape at the summit of steep sloped volcanoes and integrating these with other types of data is challenging due to difficult access and poor coverage. Here we present for the first time the near-vertical and near horizontal surface deformation field of a quiescent summit dome and the relationships with degassing and topographic patterns. Our results are derived from high resolution satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) time series based on a year of TerraSAR-X SpotLight acquisitions and Structure from Motion (SfM) processing of overflight infrared data at Volcan de Colima, Mexico. The identified deformation is dominated by localized heterogeneous subsidence of the summit dome exceeding rates of 15 cm/yr, and strongly decreasing over the year 2012, up to the renewal of explosive and extrusive activity in early 2013. We tentatively attribute the deformation to the degassing, cooling and contraction of the dome and shallow conduit material. We also find that the results strongly differ depending on the chosen InSAR time series method, which potentially overprints the true physical complexities of small scale, shallow deformation processes. The combined interpretation of the deformation and infrared data reveals a complex spatial relationship between the degassing pathways and the deformation. While we observe no deformation across the crater rim fumaroles, discontinuities in the deformation field are more commonly observed around the dome rim fumaroles and occasionally on the dome upper surface. We propose that the deformation pattern is also linked to processes controlling the fumarole formation and distribution (topography, permeability and volcanic activity), and the lack of direct relationships may be explained by how the influence of these processes varies across the volcanic summit. The presented work provides a new approach for safely monitoring the activity and stability of internal dome structures, as well as for constraining and validating models of dome degassing pathways and densification processes.

Conservation of these forests from widespread degradation in recent years has resulted in numerous FtEDD + projects that require rapid assessment of the carbon stocks and changes. Here, we use a combination of inventory plots and harvested trees to develop allometric models and to quantify the variations of forest structure and carbon density across the Choco region. We used 45 ha of inventory plots sampled in 15 1-ha permanent and 120 temporary 0.25-ha plots set under a stratified design. Likewise, we used 296 and 96 harvested trees and palms, respectively, with diameter ranging between 5 and 158.6 cm to develop the tree and palm allometry for AGB estimation. A model to estimate stem wood density from branch wood density was applied. Coarse woody debris (CWD) was also tallied and the dry mass stored quantified. We evaluated an alternative method to rapidly estimate wood density in tropical forests from sampling small branches. The total mean AGB in the 15 plot clusters was 239.8 73.2 Mg ha-1. The mean percentage of AGB represented by trees, palms, and CWD was 88.6 3.2, 3.1 2.0, and 8.3 3.0, respectively. Overall, our total AGB estimates are similar to those reported for wet lowland tropical forests but lower than those reported in tropical dry-seasonal forests. Our results emphasize on the advantage of employing height-diameter models developed from harvested trees to increase the accuracy of the AGB estimation in tropical forests. The wood density estimation was in good agreement with mean plot estimates made to reliable floristic inventories available for four 1-ha plots. This methodology can be further improved by including a sampling design based on tree diameter classes, which can help overcome the use of "static" databases built on species names. Finally, our findings support the use of the existing regional and pantropical allometries to estimate both tree height and the aboveground biomass in tropical wet forests, but emphasize the need of having more local and regional models to quantify the bias and improve the estimation of forest carbon density across different forest types.

Control of the Swiss Free Electron Laser	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							ITERATIVE LEARNING CONTROL; SYSTEMS; MANIPULATORS	The SwissFEL is capable of generating high-power, tunable X-ray pulses that are used to study molecular structure and dynamic processes at extremely fast timescales. The FEL effectively acts as a femtosecond photographic flash and will allow researchers to observe the creation of molecules in chemical reactions or study the detailed structure of proteins. The X-rays are generated by accelerating a pulsed beam of electrons through a high-energy, pulsed, radio-frequency field-to an energy of 5.8 GeV-and then a transverse periodic magnetic field. The accelerator is a series of 113 evacuated tube-like structures, energized by 32 high-power (up to 50 MW peak) amplifiers. The amplifiers are switched on for only 1-3 mu s as each beam pulse is fired, and the entire process repeats 100 times per second. Precise control of each amplifier is applied every 4.2 ns. The control methods described involve learning the subtleties of the effect of adjustments on the beam pulse and applying these as corrections to the next pulse. Experiments on full-scale amplifiers and shorter beam-lines show that these corrections provide the electron beam quality and repeatability for the complete FEL system.

We modeled the snowpack by a layered medium and compute the phase of specularly reflected signals from the snowpack. Phase change of the reflected signal is predicted to be strongly dependent on SWE for dry snow and on snow depth for wet snow. Phase sensitivity to SWE increases with frequency. Reflected signals with frequencies above S-band, however, will experience rapid phase wrapping (360 degrees change) and become more susceptible to fringe washing due to spatial variability of SWE across the footprint. We also examined the impact of snow grain size, snow density, snow layering, ground surface scattering, and incoherent scattering from ice grains embedded in the snowpack, concluding that these factors do not have a substantial impact on the phase-SWE relationship. However, the snow wetness of more than a few percent can make the reflection from air-snow interface dominant, leading to a correlation between phase change and snow depth. To address the path delay due to the ionosphere, dual-frequency observations would have to be considered. Modeling analysis indicates that the coherent change detection is a promising technique for remote sensing of SWE.

Modulation of the Ganges-Brahmaputra River Plume by the Indian Ocean Dipole and Eddies Inferred From Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						SMAP; salinity; Bay of Bengal; river plume; IOD; oceanic eddies	SEA-SURFACE SALINITY; SUMMER MONSOON; EAST-COAST; NORTH BAY; BENGAL; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; LAYER; SMOS; MODEL	The Bay of Bengal receives large amounts of freshwater from the Ganga-Brahmaputra (GB) river during the summer monsoon. The resulting upper-ocean freshening influences seasonal rainfall, cyclones, and biological productivity. Sparse in situ observations and previous modeling studies suggest that the East India Coastal Current (EICC) transports these freshwaters southward after the monsoon as an approximately 200 km wide, 2,000 km long river in the sea along the East Indian coast. Sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides unprecedented views of this peculiar feature from intraseasonal to interannual timescales. SMAP SSS has a 0.83 correlation and 0.49 rms-difference to 0-5 m in situ measurements. SMAP and in stu data both indicate a SSS standard deviation of similar to 0.7 to 1 away from the coast, that rises to 2 pss within 100 km of the coast, providing a very favorable signal-to-noise ratio in coastal areas. SMAP also captures the strong northern BoB, postmonsoon cross-shore SSS contrasts (similar to 10 pss) measured along ship transects. SMAP data are also consistent with previous modeling results that suggested a modulation of the EICC/GB plume southward extent by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Remote forcing associated with the negative Indian Ocean Dipole in the fall of 2016 indeed caused a stronger EICC and river in the sea that extended by approximately 800 km further south than that in 2015 (positive IOD year). The combination of SMAP and altimeter data shows eddies stirring the freshwater plume away from the coast.	[Fournier, S.; Lee, T.; Gierach, M.

Compositional variations in sands of the Bagnold Dunes, Gale crater, Mars, from visible-shortwave infrared spectroscopy and comparison with ground truth from the Curiosity rover	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						CRISM; spectroscopy; wind sorting; Mars; Bagnold Dunes; MCMC	FINITE FAULT EARTHQUAKE; BAYESIAN INVERSION; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; AEOLIAN ACTIVITY; SOURCE MODELS; GRAIN-SIZE; SEGREGATION; MINERALOGY; OLIVINE; WIND	During its ascent up Mount Sharp, the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover traversed the Bagnold Dune Field. We model sand modal mineralogy and grain size at four locations near the rover traverse, using orbital shortwave infrared single-scattering albedo spectra and a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation of Hapke's radiative transfer theory to fully constrain uncertainties and permitted solutions. These predictions, evaluated against in situ measurements at one site from the Curiosity rover, show that X-ray diffraction-measured mineralogy of the basaltic sands is within the 95% confidence interval of model predictions. However, predictions are relatively insensitive to grain size and are nonunique, especially when modeling the composition of minerals with solid solutions. We find an overall basaltic mineralogy and show subtle spatial variations in composition in and around the Bagnold Dunes, consistent with a mafic enrichment of sands with cumulative aeolian-transport distance by sorting of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase grains. Furthermore, the large variations in Fe and Mg abundances (similar to 20wt %) at the Bagnold Dunes suggest that compositional variability may be enhanced by local mixing of well-sorted sand with proximal sand sources. Our estimates demonstrate a method for orbital quantification of composition with rigorous uncertainty determination and provide key constraints for interpreting in situ measurements of compositional variability within Martian aeolian sandstones.

Chemistry, mineralogy, and grain properties at Namib and High dunes, Bagnold dune field, Gale crater, Mars: A synthesis of Curiosity rover observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars soils; sand dunes; dust; amorphous phase; volatiles; grain size	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; X-RAY SPECTROMETER; MERIDIANI-PLANUM; MARTIAN REGOLITH; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; CLAY-MINERALS; SCIENCE; ROCKS; WATER; STRATIGRAPHY	The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover performed coordinated measurements to examine the textures and compositions of aeolian sands in the active Bagnold dune field. The Bagnold sands are rounded to subrounded, very fine to medium sized (similar to 45-500m) with 6 distinct grain colors. In contrast to sands examined by Curiosity in a dust-covered, inactive bedform called Rocknest and soils at other landing sites, Bagnold sands are darker, less red, better sorted, have fewer silt-sized or smaller grains, and show no evidence for cohesion. Nevertheless, Bagnold mineralogy and Rocknest mineralogy are similar with plagioclase, olivine, and pyroxenes in similar proportions comprising >90% of crystalline phases, along with a substantial amorphous component (35%15%). Yet Bagnold and Rocknest bulk chemistry differ. Bagnold sands are Si enriched relative to other soils at Gale crater, and H2O, S, and Cl are lower relative to all previously measured Martian soils and most Gale crater rocks. Mg, Ni, Fe, and Mn are enriched in the coarse-sieved fraction of Bagnold sands, corroborated by visible/near-infrared spectra that suggest enrichment of olivine. Collectively, patterns in major element chemistry and volatile release data indicate two distinctive volatile reservoirs in Martian soils: (1) amorphous components in the sand-sized fraction (represented by Bagnold) that are Si-enriched, hydroxylated alteration products and/or H2O- or OH-bearing impact or volcanic glasses and (2) amorphous components in the fine fraction (<40m; represented by Rocknest and other bright soils) that are Fe, S, and Cl enriched with low Si and adsorbed and structural H2O. Plain Language Summary The Bagnold dune field is an active sand field with moving dunes and sits between the landing site of the Curiosity rover and rocks of interest higher up on Mount Sharp. When passing through the dune field, we used all of Curiosity's instruments to measure the chemistry, mineralogy, and grain size of sands in the Bagnold dune field in order to figure out where they came from, how the sands are transported, and what volatile materials (like water) lie within Martian soils. We found that the Bagnold sand dunes are very well sorted; no dusty materials are found within them, in stark contrast to soils seen previously with Curiosity and with rovers at other landing sites. We found that the coarser sand grains are enriched in the volcanic minerals olivine and pyroxene, confirming a prediction from orbit that wind-related activity seems to concentrate these phases. We also found that the dunes were much lower in water and other volatile elements like sulfur and chlorine versus all previous Mars soils. Using a combination of the rover's sieving system and chemical measurement tools, we figured out that two types of materials host water. In the first type of material, common in these sands, water is low in abundance (similar to 1%), very tightly bound to the grains, and is not released until temperatures >200 degrees C. In the second type of material, water is higher in abundance (2%) and more easily released by heating. Sieved water-bearing fine materials may be a useful resource for human explorers.	[Ehlmann, B.

Evolved gas analyses of sedimentary rocks and eolian sediment in Gale Crater, Mars: Results of the Curiosity rover's sample analysis at Mars instrument from Yellowknife Bay to the Namib Dune	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; nitrate; perchlroate; carbonate; organic carbon; sulfate	ROCKNEST AEOLIAN DEPOSIT; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; ORGANIC-MOLECULES; MARTIAN SOIL; MAGNESIUM-SULFATE; SCIENCE; CHEMISTRY; SURFACE; CARBON; CO2	The sample analysis at Mars instrument evolved gas analyzer (SAM-EGA) has detected evolved water, H-2, SO2, H2S, NO, CO2, CO, O-2, and HCl from two eolian sediments and nine sedimentary rocks from Gale Crater, Mars. These evolved gas detections indicate nitrates, organics, oxychlorine phase, and sulfates are widespread with phyllosilicates and carbonates occurring in select Gale Crater materials. Coevolved CO2 (160248-2373820gC((CO2))/g) and CO (113-320130 gC((CO))/g) suggest that organic C is present in Gale Crater materials. Five samples evolved CO2 at temperatures consistent with carbonate (0.32 +/- 0.05-0.70 +/- 0.1wt% CO3). Evolved NO amounts to 0.002 +/- 0.007-0.06 +/- 0.03wt% NO3. Evolution of O-2 suggests that oxychlorine phases (chlorate/perchlorate) (0.05 +/- 0.025-1.05 +/- 0.44wt% ClO4) are present, while SO2 evolution indicates the presence of crystalline and/or poorly crystalline Fe and Mg sulfate and possibly sulfide. Evolved H2O (0.9 +/- 0.3-2.5 +/- 1.6wt% H2O) is consistent with the presence of adsorbed water, hydrated salts, interlayer/structural water from phyllosilicates, and possible inclusion water in mineral/amorphous phases. Evolved H-2 and H2S suggest that reduced phases occur despite the presence of oxidized phases (nitrate, oxychlorine, sulfate, and carbonate). SAM results coupled with CheMin mineralogical and Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer elemental analyses indicate that Gale Crater sedimentary rocks have experienced a complex authigenetic/diagenetic history involving fluids with varying pH, redox, and salt composition. The inferred geochemical conditions were favorable for microbial habitability and if life ever existed, there was likely sufficient organic C to support a small microbial population.

Visible/near-infrared spectral diversity from in situ observations of the Bagnold Dune Field sands in Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Curiosity; Bagnold Dune; ChemCam; Mastcam; multispectral; visible spectroscopy	CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; MINERALOGY; SCIENCE; REFLECTANCE; OLIVINE; METEORITE; SULFATE; SOILS; DUST; UNIT	As part of the Bagnold Dune campaign conducted by Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, visible/near-infrared reflectance spectra of dune sands were acquired using Mast Camera (Mastcam) multispectral imaging (445-1013nm) and Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) passive point spectroscopy (400-840nm). By comparing spectra from pristine and rover-disturbed ripple crests and troughs within the dune field, and through analysis of sieved grain size fractions, constraints on mineral segregation from grain sorting could be determined. In general, the dune areas exhibited low relative reflectance, a weak similar to 530nm absorption band, an absorption band near 620nm, and a spectral downturn after similar to 685nm consistent with olivine-bearing sands. The finest grain size fractions occurred within ripple troughs and in the subsurface and typically exhibited the strongest similar to 530nm bands, highest relative reflectances, and weakest red/near-infrared ratios, consistent with a combination of crystalline and amorphous ferric materials. Coarser-grained samples were the darkest and bluest and exhibited weaker similar to 530nm bands, lower relative reflectances, and stronger downturns in the near-infrared, consistent with greater proportions of mafic minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. These grains were typically segregated along ripple crests and among the upper surfaces of grain flows in disturbed sands. Sieved dune sands exhibited progressive decreases in reflectance with increasing grain size, as observed in laboratory spectra of olivine size separates. The continuum of spectral features observed between the coarse- and fine-grained dune sands suggests that mafic grains, ferric materials, and air fall dust mix in variable proportions depending on aeolian activity and grain sorting.

New observations that probe between 0.1 and 30hPa in Jupiter's atmosphere using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES), mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, have characterized the vertical structure of the QQO during a complete cycle between January 2012 and April 2016. These new observations show the thermal oscillation previously detected at 10hPa and that it extends over a pressure range of 2-17hPa. We have incorporated a spectrum of wave drag parameterizations into the Explicit Planetary Isentropic Code general circulation model to simulate the observed Jovian QQO temperature signatures inferred from the TEXES observations as a function of latitude. A new stochastic wave drag parameterization explores vertical wind structure and offers insight into the spectra of waves that likely exist in Jupiter's atmosphere to force the QQO. High-frequency gravity waves produced from convection likely contribute significantly to the QQO momentum budget. The model temperature outputs show strong correlations to equatorial and surrounding latitude temperature fields retrieved from the TEXES data sets at different epochs. Our results reproduce the QQO phenomenon as a zonal jet that descends over time in response to Jovian atmospheric forcing (e.g., gravity waves from convection). Plain Language Summary Observations of Jupiter from telescopes in Hawaii have tracked changes in the temperatures of the atmosphere at the equator, showing a rise and fall every 4years. There is a similar jet stream in Earth's equatorial atmosphere that is powered by thunderstorms and changes direction approximately every two at altitudes above the clouds, with corresponding changes in the air temperature. The direction of this jet stream has been linked to several large-scale weather patterns like hurricane formation and atmospheric ozone levels. We developed a computer model that simulates tropical thunderstorms on Jupiter to reproduce this jet stream and its changes in direction. Not only could we match the behavior of the temperatures over time but also could we see the model's spatial structure look very much like Jupiter's observed horizontal and vertical temperatures.

The Impact of Atmospheric Modeling Errors on GRACE Estimates of Mass Loss in Greenland and Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							ACCELERATION; REANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; PROGRAM; BALANCE	Systematic errors in Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) monthly mass estimates over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets can originate from low-frequency biases in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Operational Analysis model, the atmospheric component of the Atmospheric and Ocean Dealising Level-1B (AOD1B) product used to forward model atmospheric and ocean gravity signals in GRACE processing. These biases are revealed in differences in surface pressure between the ECMWF Operational Analysis model, state-of-the-art reanalyses, and in situ surface pressure measurements. While some of these errors are attributable to well-understood discrete model changes and have published corrections, we examine errors these corrections do not address. We compare multiple models and in situ data in Antarctica and Greenland to determine which models have the most skill relative to monthly averages of the dealiasing model. We also evaluate linear combinations of these models and synthetic pressure fields generated from direct interpolation of pressure observations. These models consistently reveal drifts in the dealiasing model that cause the acceleration of Antarctica's mass loss between April 2002 and August 2016 to be underestimated by approximately 4Gtyr(-2). We find similar results after attempting to solve the inverse problem, recovering pressure biases directly from the GRACE Jet Propulsion Laboratory RL05.1 M mascon solutions. Over Greenland, we find a 2Gt yr(-1) bias in mass trend. While our analysis focuses on errors in Release 05 of AOD1B, we also evaluate the new AOD1B RL06 product. We find that this new product mitigates some of the aforementioned biases. Plain Language Summary The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites measure changes in gravity over Greenland and Antarctica, allowing estimation of recent mass loss in both ice sheets. GRACE senses gravity signals from sources of mass change other than ice, including the atmosphere. The model used to remove atmospheric signals from GRACE is operational in nature, and errors in this model can introduce biases to estimates of mass change in Greenland and Antarctica. We estimate the biases in the operational model by comparing its predictions of surface pressure (the local weight of the atmosphere) to measurements from automatic weather stations in Greenland and Antarctica. We also compare this operational model to better, more physically, and observationally consistent reanalyses. Over Antarctica, our analysis consistently reveals that the magnitude of the acceleration of ice mass loss is underestimated by approximately 4Gtyr(-2), 40% more than previous estimates. Over Greenland, we find that atmospheric errors add noise to estimates of month-to-month variation in ice mass. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to observe these pressure errors with GRACE, highlighting the possibility of using satellite gravity as a meteorological measurement.

J	McGranaghan, RM; Mannucci, AJ; Forsyth, C				McGranaghan, Ryan M.; Mannucci, Anthony J.; Forsyth, Colin			A Comprehensive Analysis of Multiscale Field-Aligned Currents: Characteristics, Controlling Parameters, and Relationships	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; SCALE BIRKELAND CURRENTS; SOLAR-WIND PARAMETERS; NETWORK ANALYSIS; CURRENT SHEETS; REGIONS 1; DEPENDENCE; ELECTRODYNAMICS; MAGNETOSPHERE; IONOSPHERE	We explore the characteristics, controlling parameters, and relationships of multiscale field-aligned currents (FACs) using a rigorous, comprehensive, and cross-platform analysis. Our unique approach combines FAC data from the Swarm satellites and the Advanced Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) to create a database of small-scale (similar to 10-150 km, < 1 degrees latitudinal width), mesoscale (similar to 150-250 km, 1-2 degrees latitudinal width), and large-scale (> 250 km) FACs. We examine these data for the repeatable behavior of FACs across scales (i.e., the characteristics), the dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field orientation, and the degree to which each scale "departs" from nominal large-scale specification. We retrieve new information by utilizing magnetic latitude and local time dependence, correlation analyses, and quantification of the departure of smaller from larger scales. We find that (1) FACs characteristics and dependence on controlling parameters do not map between scales in a straight forward manner, (2) relationships between FAC scales exhibit local time dependence, and (3) the dayside high-latitude region is characterized by remarkably distinct FAC behavior when analyzed at different scales, and the locations of distinction correspond to " anomalous" ionosphere-thermosphere behavior. Comparing with nominal large-scale FACs, we find that differences are characterized by a horseshoe shape, maximizing across dayside local times, and that difference magnitudes increase when smaller-scale observed FACs are considered. We suggest that both new physics and increased resolution of models are required to address the multiscale complexities. We include a summary table of our findings to provide a quick reference for differences between multiscale FACs. Plain LanguageSummary Multiscale processes, or those which contain important features across multiple scales in time and/or space, characterize the near-Earth space environment. Multiscale effects are particularly important to understand interactions between regions, where numerous processes contribute to the dynamics. In the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system, currents flowing along Earth's magnetic field lines, or field-aligned currents (FACs), provide the dominant form of energy and momentum exchange. FACs are, therefore, a critical component of the space weather environment and are inherently multiscale. Though much progress has been made toward understanding FACs at large spatial scales (> 250 km), smaller-scale FACs and relationships between scales are not well understood. We take advantage of two different satellite missions to explore the repeatable spatial behavior (i.e., the characteristics) of FACs across scales, the dependencies on solar wind conditions, and the degree to which each scale differs from nominal large-scale FACs. We specify differences in the spatial patterns of multiscale FACs and connect particularly strong differences at dayside local times to previously identified irregular space weather activity. We find that the relationships between scales are complex. We provide a summary table of our key findings and suggest areas of future work that will contribute to new multiscale understanding.

A Millimeter-Wave Quasi-Optical Circuit for Compact Triple-Band Receiving System	JOURNAL OF INFRARED MILLIMETER AND TERAHERTZ WAVES			English	Article						Triple-band receiver; Gaussian beam; Quasi-optical circuit; Frequency-independent design; Antenna aperture efficiency	KOREAN VLBI NETWORK; MM	A novel receiver optical system designed for Korean VLBI Network (KVN) has been used for conducting simultaneous millimeter-wave very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at frequencies of 22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz. This multi-frequency band receiver system has been effective in compensation of atmospheric phase fluctuation by unique phase referencing technique in mm-VLBI observations. However, because the original optics system incorporated individual cryogenic receivers in separate cryostats, a rather bulky optical bench of size about 2600 mm x 2300 mm x 60 mm was required. To circumvent difficulties in installation and beam alignment, an integrated quasi-optical circuit incorporating a more compact triple-band receiver in single cryostat is proposed in this paper. The recommended frequency bands of the improved triple-band receiver are K(18-26 GHz) band, Q(35-50 GHz) band, and W(85-115 GHz) band. A frequency-independent quasi-optical circuit for triple band is adopted to obtain constant aperture efficiency as a function of the observed frequencies. The simulation results show that total aperture efficiency of each recommended frequency band is maintained almost constant within 1%. We present the design details of the compact wideband quasi-optical circuit and the triple-band receiver optimized for simultaneous multi-frequency observations.

The HITRAN2016 molecular spectroscopic database	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HITRAN; Spectroscopic database; Molecular spectroscopy; Molecular absorption; Spectroscopic line parameters; Absorption cross-sections; Collision-induced absorption; Aerosols	ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; LINE-SHAPE PARAMETERS; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIALS; M TRANSPARENCY WINDOW; TUNABLE DIODE-LASER; HIGH-RESOLUTION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY CAVITY RING; GAS-PHASE REACTIONS; INCLUDING TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCES; ROTATIONAL-VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA	This paper describes the contents of the 2016 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compilation. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the intervening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of five major components: the traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, molecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional molecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing sequential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many, ways. It enables the incorporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape formalisms, easy user-defined output formats, and very convenient searching, filtering, and plotting of data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL) features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Gordon, I.

Molecules I to 50 are taken from the HITRAN2016 list, and, in some cases, additional isotopologues are considered for some of the molecules. Molecules 51-53 are C3H4, CH3, and CS2, respectively. TIPS are not reported for the 0 atom and CF4; thus, while there are 53 species in the list, data are reported for 51 molecules. The TIPS are determined by various methods from 1 K to a T-max that ensures the TIPS reported have converged.

Utilizing these detections and non-detections to constrain our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems also requires a detailed understanding of the basic properties of their host stars. We have determined the basic stellar properties of F, K and G stars in the Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) survey from Echelle spectra taken at the Apache Point Observatory's 3.5m telescope. Using ROBOSPECT to extract line equivalent widths and TemperatureGravity microtrubulentVelocity ITerations to calculate the fundamental parameters, we have computed T-eff, log(g), v(t), [Fe/H], chromospheric activity and the age for our sample. Our methodology was calibrated against previously published results for a portion of our sample. The distribution of [Fe/H] in our sample is consistent with that typical of the Solar neighbourhood. Additionally, we find the ages of most of our sample are < 500 Myr, but note that we cannot determine robust ages from significantly older stars via chromospheric activity age indicators. The futuremeta-analysis of the frequency ofwide stellar and sub-stellar companions imaged via the SEEDS survey will utilize our results to constrain the occurrence of detected comoving companions with the properties of their host stars.

Fundamental gain in high-contrast imaging	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: interferometers; methods: numerical; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: interferometric	LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE; INTERFEROMETRY; TURBULENCE	We show by numerical simulations a fundamental gain in contrast when combining coherently monochromatic light from two adaptive optics (AO) telescopes instead of using a single stand-alone AO telescope, assuming efficient control and acquisition systems at high speed. A contrast gain map is defined as the normalized point spread functions (PSFs) ratio of a single Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) aperture over the dual Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) aperture in Fizeau mode. The global gain averaged across the AO-corrected field of view is improved by a factor of 2 in contrast in long exposures and by a factor of 10 in contrast in short exposures (i.e. in exposures, respectively, longer or shorter than the coherence time). The fringed speckle halo in short exposures contains not only high-angular resolution information, as stated by speckle imaging and speckle interferometry, but also high-contrast imaging information. A high-gain zone is further produced in the valleys of the PSF formed by the dark Airy rings and/or the dark fringes. Earth rotation allows us to exploit various areas in the contrast gain map. A huge-contrast gain in narrow zones can be achieved when both a dark fringe and a dark ring overlap on to an exoplanet. Compared to a single 8-m LBT aperture, the 23-m LBTI Fizeau imager can provide a gain in sensitivity (by a factor of 4), a gain in angular resolution (by a factor of 3) and, as well, a gain in raw contrast (by a factor of 2-1000 varying over the AO-corrected field of view).

Sensitivity of the PSF and the MTF to adaptive optics errors and to piston errors	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; instrumentation: interferometers; methods: numerical; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: interferometric	LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE; INTERFEROMETRY	We show numerical simulations with monochromatic light in the visible for the LBTI Fizeau imager, including opto-dynamical aberrations due here to adaptive optics (AO) errors and to differential piston fluctuations, while other errors have been neglected. The achievable Strehl by the LBTI using two AO is close to the Strehl provided by a single standalone AO system, as long as other differential wavefront errors are mitigated. The LBTI Fizeau imager is primarily limited by the AO performance and by the differential piston/tip-tilt errors. Snapshots retain high-angular resolution and high-contrast imaging information by freezing the fringes against piston errors. Several merit functions have been critically evaluated in order to characterize point spread functions and the modulation transfer functions for high-contrast imaging applications. The LBTI Fizeau mode can provide an image quality suitable for standard science cases (i.e. a Strehl above 70 per cent) by performing both at a time: an AO correction better than approximate to lambda/18RMS for both short and long exposures, and a piston correction better than approximate to lambda/8 RMS for long exposures or simply below the coherence length for short exposures. Such results, which can be applied to any observing wavelength, suggest that AO and piston control at the LBTI would already improve the contrast at near-and mid-infrared wavelengths. Therefore, the LBTI Fizeau imager can be used for high-contrast imaging, providing a high-Strehl regime (by both AO systems), a cophasing mode (by a fringe tracker) and a burst mode (by a fast camera) to record fringed speckles in short exposures.

Models of the strongly lensed quasar DES J0408-5354	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: statistical; techniques: image processing; catalogues	DARK-MATTER; SUBSTRUCTURE; GALAXIES; ENERGY; MAGNIFICATION; DISCOVERY; SELECTION; IMAGES; MASSES; RATIO	We present detailed modelling of the recently discovered, quadruply lensed quasar J0408-5354, with the aim of interpreting its remarkable configuration: besides three quasar images (A, B, D) around the main deflector (G1), a fourth image (C) is significantly reddened and dimmed by a perturber (G2) which is not detected in the Dark Energy Survey imaging data. From lens models incorporating (dust-corrected) flux ratios, we find a perturber Einstein radius 0.04 arcsec less than or similar to R-E,R- G2 less than or similar to 0.2 arcsec and enclosed mass M-p(R-E,R- G2) less than or similar to 1.0 x 10(10) M-circle dot. The main deflector has stellar mass log(10)(M-star/M-circle dot) = 11.49(-0.32)(+0.46), a projected mass M-p(R-E,R- G1) approximate to 6 x 10(11) M-circle dot within its Einstein radius R-E,R- G1 = (1.85 +/- 0.15) arcsec and predicted velocity dispersion 267-280 km s(-1). Follow-up images from a companion monitoring campaign show additional components, including a candidate second source at a redshift between the quasar and G1. Models with free perturbers, and dust-corrected and delay-corrected flux ratios, are also explored. The predicted time-delays (Delta t(AB) = (135.0 +/- 12.6) d, Delta t(BD) = (21.0 +/- 3.5) d) roughly agree with those measured, but better imaging is required for proper modelling and comparison. We also discuss some lessons learnt from J0408-5354 on lensed quasar finding strategies, due to its chromaticity and morphology.

A Study of Daytime L-Band Scintillation in Association With Sporadic E Along the Magnetic Dip Equator	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Beacon Satellite Symposium	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Trieste, ITALY	Int Ctr Theoret Phys Unesco, IAEA			IONOSPHERIC SCINTILLATIONS; RADIO OCCULTATION; LOW-LATITUDE; SPREAD-F; REGION IRREGULARITIES; MIDLATITUDE; MORPHOLOGY	In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of occurrence of L-band scintillation in association with the appearance of sporadic E (Es) along the magnetic dip equator during daytime in 2013. The presence of L-band scintillation was determined from signals collected with GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) ground-based Scintillation Network Decision Aid receivers from five stations situated at the magnetic dip equator. The detection and analysis of Es layers were obtained from GNSS FORMOSAT-3/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (F3/C) radio occultation (RO) data. Combining ground-based data with the limb-viewing geometry from space provides a unique opportunity to retrieve complementary information about scintillation and association with equatorial E region irregularities (i.e., Es) during daytime. Results for the first time show that daytime scintillation does occur at the magnetic dip equator and the occurrence is associated with the appearance of Es observed using GNSS F3/C RO data.

J	Angelo, I; Hu, RY				Angelo, Isabel; Hu, Renyu			A Case for an Atmosphere on Super-Earth 55 Cancri e	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						occultations; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual (55 Cnc e); planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; techniques: photometric	THERMAL PHASE VARIATIONS; PLANET HD 189733B; EXOPLANET ATMOSPHERE; CURVES; MODEL; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; CHEMISTRY; TRANSIT; STAR; MAP	One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and super-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like Earth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the planets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a substantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock surface. Analyzing phase-curve photometric data around secondary eclipses has previously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the thermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We utilize a semianalytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared photometric data at 4.5 mu m. The model uses parameters of planetary properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and the atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hotspot. We determine the heat redistribution efficiency to be 1.47(-0.25)(+0.30), which implies that the advective timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat redistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of similar to 1.4 bar. The Spitzer 4.5 mu m band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet 55 Cancri e.

Stepwise heating of lunar anorthosites 60025, 60215, 65315 possibly reveals an indigenous noble gas component on the Moon	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Moon; Noble gases; Indigenous component; Comets	FORMING GIANT IMPACT; ION-IMPLANTATION EXPERIMENTS; COSMIC-RAY PARTICLES; SOLAR-WIND; ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION; IRREVERSIBLE ADSORPTION; GENESIS MISSION; XENON; TERRESTRIAL; ORIGIN	Despite extensive effort during the last four decades, no clear signature of a lunar indigenous noble gas component has been found. In order to further investigate the possible occurrence of indigenous volatiles in the Moon, we have re-analyzed the noble gas and nitrogen isotopic compositions in three anorthosite samples. Lunar anorthosites 60025, 60215 and 65315 have the lowest exposure duration (similar to 2 Ma) among Apollo samples and consequently contain only limited cosmogenic (e.g. Xe-124,Xe-126) and solar wind (SW) noble gases. Furthermore, anorthosites have negligible contributions of fissiogenic Xe isotopes because of their very low Pu and U contents. As observed in previous studies (Lightner and Marti, 1974; Leich and Niemeyer, 1975), lunar anorthosite Xe presents an isotopic composition very close to that of terrestrial atmospheric Xe, previously attributed to "anomalous adsorption" of terrestrial Xe after sample return. The presumed atmospheric Xe contamination can only be removed by heating the samples at medium to high temperatures under vacuum, and is therefore different from common adsorption. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the adsorption of Xe onto lunar anorthositic powder using infrared reflectance spectroscopy. A clear shift in the anorthosite IR absorbance peaks is detected when comparing the IR absorbance spectra of the lunar anorthositic powder before and after exposure to a neutral Xe-rich atmosphere. This observation accounts for the chemical bonding (chemisorption) of Xe onto anorthosite, which is stronger than the common physical bonding (physisorption) and could account for the anomalous adsorption of Xe onto lunar samples. Our high precision Xe isotope analyses show slight mass fractionation patterns across Xe128-136 isotopes with systematic deficits in the heavy Xe isotopes (mostly Xe-136 and marginally Xe-134) that have not previously been observed. This composition could be the result of mixing between an irreversibly adsorbed terrestrial contaminant that is mostly released at high temperature and an additional signature. Solar Wind (SW) Xe contents, estimated from SW-Ne and SW-Ar concentrations and SW-Ne/Ar/Xe elemental ratios, do not support SW as the additional contribution. Using a chi(2) test, the latter is best accounted for by cometary Xe as measured in the coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (Marty et al., 2017) or by the primordial U-Xe composition inferred to be the precursor of atmospheric Xe (Pepin, 1994; Avice et al., 2017). It could have been contributed to the lunar budget by volatile-rich bodies that participated to the building of the terrestrial atmosphere inventory (Marty et al., 2017). (C) 2017 The Author(s).

Line parameters for CO2- and self-broadening in nu(1) band of (HDO)-O-16	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HDO-CO2 widths; HDO-CO2 shifts; HDO-CO2 MCRB calculated list; Temperature dependence exponents; Mars atmosphere	ROBERT-BONAMY FORMALISM; HALF-WIDTHS; WATER-VAPOR; COLLISIONAL PARAMETERS; H2O LINES; SHIFTS; TEMPERATURE; ATMOSPHERE; MARS; HDO	Lorentz half-width coefficients and their temperature dependence exponents for CO2 broadening in the fundamental bands of HDO are important for reliable and accurate interpretation of Mars and Venus atmospheric data and to determine D/H. Uncertainties in the temperature dependences of the CO2-broadened half-width coefficients lead to large errors in the retrieved mixing ratios and hence in HDO column abundances. In this high-resolution FTIR laboratory study, we report first measurements of the temperature dependences of half-width coefficients for HDO transitions in the nu(1) and 2 nu(2) bands broadened by CO2. Accurate line positions, intensities, CO2-broadened width and pressure shift coefficients, their temperature dependences, collisional line mixing coefficients for HDO-CO2 system and quadratic speed dependence parameters have been retrieved for a large number of transitions in the nu(1) band. Room-temperature self-broadened half-width coefficients, self-shift coefficients, and collisional line mixing coefficients for HDO-HDO system were also measured for the same number of nu(1) transitions. Positions and intensities were measured for nearly 60 transitions in the weaker 2 nu(2) band along with a few room-temperature measurements of CO2- and self-broadening and pressure-shift coefficients. These results were obtained from simultaneous nonlinear least squares fittings of ten high-resolution absorption spectra recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR FTS at JPL and two coolable sample cells. Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy (MCRB) formalism was applied to compute both types of broadening and pressure shift coefficients, and the temperature dependences of the CO2- and self-broadening parameters. Present measurements are compared with the MCRB calculations and other theoretical values reported in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Devi, V. Malathy; Benner, D.

Line parameters for CO2- and self-broadening in the nu(3) band of (HDO)-O-16	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HDO-CO2 widths; HDO-CO2 shifts; HDO-CO2 calculated line list; Temperature dependence of widths; Off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients; Mars atmosphere	ROBERT-BONAMY FORMALISM; HALF-WIDTHS; WATER-VAPOR; COLLISIONAL PARAMETERS; H2O LINES; TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCES; SHIFTS; ATMOSPHERE; PLANETARY; SHAPES	Pressure-broadened line shape parameters of transitions in the nu(3) band of HDO (nu(0) = 3707.4 cm(-1)) were measured from spectra of HDO and mixtures of HDO and CO2 for application to accurate retrievals of HDO abundances and D/H ratios for CO2-rich planetary atmospheres of Mars and Venus. A few calculated line lists have recently been published on HDO-CO2 line shapes and their temperature dependences, but the present study represents the first laboratory measurements of those parameters in the nu(3) band; Measurements for nearly 100 transitions in the nu(3) band have been made. Room temperature measurements of self-broadened width and shift coefficients for all of these transitions, line mixing via off diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients and quadratic speed dependence parameter were measured for the majority of these transitions. All these measurements were made by simultaneously fitting eleven high-resolution spectra of HDO and HDO-CO2 mixtures at various temperatures and pressures recorded with the Bruker Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Two specially built coolable absorption cells with path lengths of 20.38 cm and 20.941 m were used to contain the sample mixtures. Multispectrum nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm was employed in the analysis. Calculations using the Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (MCRB) were made for the half width coefficients, their temperature dependences and pressure shift coefficients for the HDO-CO2 and HDO HDO collision systems. The calculations were made for all nu(3) band transitions in the 1100-4100 cm(-1) region on the HITRAN2012 database. Present measurements are compared with the MCRB calculations and other literature values. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Devi, V. Malathy; Benner, D.

For remote sensing of well-mixed gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), where the atmospheric variability is small compared to the background, the quality of the molecular absorption model is key. Recent updates to the 1.6 mu m and 2.06 mu m CO2 absorption model used within the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) algorithm are described and validated. A set of 164 atmospheric spectra from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) is used to compare three models, both previous and current versions of absorption coefficient tables (largely derived from recent multispectrum fitting analyses targeted specifically at these bands) as well as a recent model constructed to use the HITRAN 2012 compilation. Both spectral residuals and retrieved column-averaged CO2 mixing ratios (XCO2) are included in the comparison. Absorption coefficients based on the updated multispectrum fitting analyses provide residuals comparable to or smaller than either the previous version of the multispectrum fits or the HITRAN 2012-based model. For the 2.06 mu m band the updated model finds noticeably lower residuals for low water content cases. It is found that apart from a scaling factor the prior and updated absorption models result in similar retrieved values of XCO2 for the 2.06 mu m band and a slightly different airmass dependence for the 1.6 mu m band.

Measurements and modeling of (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17 spectroscopic parameters at 2 mu m	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						(OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17; Minor carbon dioxide isotopologues; Mass spectrometry; Bruker 125HR; Line intensities; Collisional narrowing; Transition dipole moments; Herman-Wallis factors	SENSITIVITY CAVITY RING; ENRICHED CARBON-DIOXIDE; CO2 LINE PARAMETERS; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; BROADENING COEFFICIENTS; DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES; FOURIER-TRANSFORM; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; HALF-WIDTHS; CW-CRDS	The lack of spectroscopic measurements for rare CO2 isotopologues was the main motivation of this work. In our present study we report line intensity measurements for (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17 made with a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS-125HR) and a 21 m path cryogenic Herriott cell at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For this, a O-17-enriched CO2 gas sample was used, which comes as a mixture of primary and several minor CO2 isotopologues. The mole fraction of the (OCO)-O-6-C-12-O-17 isotopologue in the mixture was determined to be 0.3991 by mass spectrometry from a Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (SIRMS) under stochastic distribution assumption at thermal equilibrium. Since the collisional narrowing effect was observed, the Rautian molecular line shape profile was systematically adopted instead of the Voigt profile. Absolute line positions were also investigated by performing a wavenumber calibration based on CO, HCI and a few well-known (OCO)-O-6-C-12-O-17 transitions. Finally, around 1000 transitions were studied between 4604 and 5126 cm(-1) involving 15 bands of the (OCO)-O-6-C-12-O-17 isotopologue. All the measured line intensities were renormalized to be the values for 100% pure isotopologue sample. Transition dipole moments and Herman-Wallis factors were derived enabling a global comparison with theoretical calculations and predictions for the 15 bands of the (OCO)-O-6-C-12-O-17 isotopologue. For the measured line positions, the absolute accuracy is around 2 x 10(-4) cm(-1). The accuracies of retrieved line intensities are 2- 5% for five cold and two hot bands, and 6-30% for eight other weaker hot bands. Results from this work were in a good agreement with HITRAN 2012 for positions, but showed rather significant discrepancies for line intensities. An extensive line list was generated from new experimental measurements in order to improve and validate spectroscopic knowledge of (OCO)-O-6-C-12-O-17 isotopologue in support of atmospheric remote sensing for the Earth (e.g., OCO-2 mission), Mars and Venus.

Analysis of PH3 spectra in the Octad range 2733-3660cm(-1)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Infrared spectra; AB(3) molecules; Line intensities; Effective Hamiltonian; Ab initio dipole; Phosphine; Octad; Outer planets	DIPOLE-MOMENT SURFACES; N-2-BROADENING COEFFICIENTS; V(4) BANDS; PHOSPHINE; INTENSITIES; JUPITER; SATURN; V(2)	Improved analysis of positions and intensities of phosphine spectral lines in the Octad region 2733-3660cm(-1) is reported. Some 5768 positions and 1752 intensities were modelled with RMS deviations of 0.00185cm(-1) and 10.9%, respectively. Based on an ab initio potential energy surface, the full Hamiltonian of phosphine nuclear motion was reduced to an effective Hamiltonian using high-order Contact Transformations method adapted to polyads of symmetric top AB(3)-type molecules with a subsequent empirical optimization of parameters. More than 2000 new ro-vibrational lines were assigned that include transitions for all 13 vibrational Octad sublevels. This new fitting of measured positions and intensities considerably improved the accuracy of line parameters in the calculated database. A comparison of our results with experimental spectra of PNNL showed that the new set of line parameters from this work permits better simulation of observed cross-sections than the HITRAN2012 linelist. In the 2733-3660cm(-1) range, our integrated intensities show a good consistency with recent ab initio variational calculations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Nikitin, A.

Static migration torque	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability; planet-disc interactions; protoplanetary discs	COROTATION TORQUES; ACCRETION; DISK; INSTABILITY; ROTATION; FORMULA	Motivated by models suggesting that the inner planet forming regions of protoplanetary discs are predominantly lacking in viscosity-inducing turbulence, and are possibly threaded by Hall-effect generated large-scale horizontal magnetic fields, we examine the dynamics of the corotation region of a low-mass planet in such an environment. The corotation torque in an inviscid, isothermal, dead zone ought to saturate, with the libration region becoming both symmetrical and of a uniform vortensity, leading to fast inward migration driven by the Lindblad torques alone. However, in such a low viscosity situation, the material on librating streamlines essentially preserves its vortensity. If there is relative radial motion between the disc gas and the planet, the librating streamlines will no longer be symmetrical. Hence, if the gas is torqued by a large-scale magnetic field so that it undergoes a net inflow or outflow past the planet, driving evolution of the vortensity and inducing asymmetry of the corotation region, the corotation torque can grow, leading to a positive torque. In this paper, we treat this effect by applying a symmetry argument to the previously studied case of a migrating planet in an inviscid disc. Our results show that the corotation torque due to a laminar Hall-induced magnetic field in a dead zone behaves quite differently from that studied previously for a viscous disc. Furthermore, the magnetic field induced corotation torque and the dynamical corotation torque in a low viscosity disc can be regarded as one unified effect.

Constraints on the perturbed mutual motion in Didymos due to impact-induced deformation of its primary after the DART impact	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: numerical; space vehicles; celestial mechanics; minor planets; asteroids: individual: 65803 Didymos	DEFLECTION ASSESSMENT MISSION; INDUCED SEISMIC ACTIVITY; ROTATIONAL BREAKUP; ASTEROID IMPACT; 1999 KW4; SPIN-UP; ENVIRONMENT; DISRUPTION; SIMULATION; SHAPES	Binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos is the target of the proposed NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), part of the Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission concept. In this mission, the DART spacecraft is planned to impact the secondary body of Didymos, perturbing mutual dynamics of the system. The primary body is currently rotating at a spin period close to the spin barrier of asteroids, and materials ejected from the secondary due to the DART impact are likely to reach the primary. These conditions may cause the primary to reshape, due to landslides or internal deformation, changing the permanent gravity field. Here, we propose that if shape deformation of the primary occurs, the mutual orbit of the system would be perturbed due to a change in the gravity field. We use a numerical simulation technique based on the full two-body problem to investigate the shape effect on the mutual dynamics in Didymos after the DART impact. The results show that under constant volume, shape deformation induces strong perturbation in the mutual motion. We find that the deformation process always causes the orbital period of the system to become shorter. If surface layers with a thickness greater than similar to 0.4 m on the poles of the primary move down to the equatorial region due to the DART impact, a change in the orbital period of the system and in the spin period of the primary will be detected by ground-based measurement.

Data are drawn from a sample of eight fields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of galaxies down to 109M(circle dot). Taking advantage of > 4000 secure spectroscopic redshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct threedimensional density maps between 0.55 < z < 1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation approach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local environment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers of high-to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward implication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency of (a) destroying lower mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher mass galaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs of starforming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the quiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMFof field galaxies and that of denser environments, we devise a simple semi-empirical model. The model begins with a sample of approximate to 10(6) galaxies at z(start) = 5 with stellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then evolve down to z(final) = 0.8 following empirical prescriptions for star-formation, quenching and galaxy-galaxy merging. We run the simulationmultiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts of merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to reproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of these mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e. g. galaxy groups).

However, neither the proposed positive vegetation-rainfall feedback nor its underlying albedo mechanism has been convincingly demonstrated using observational data. Here, we present observational evidence for the region's proposed positive vegetation-rainfall feedback on the seasonal to interannual time scale, and find that it is associated with a moisture recycling mechanism, rather than the classic albedo-based mechanism. Positive anomalies of remotely sensed vegetation greenness across the Sahel during the late and post-monsoon periods favor enhanced evapotranspiration, precipitable water, convective activity and rainfall, indicative of amplified moisture recycling. The identified modest low-level cooling and anomalous atmospheric subsidence in response to positive vegetation greenness anomalies are counter to the responses expected through the classic vegetation-albedo feedback mechanism. The observational analysis further reveals enhanced dust emissions in response to diminished Sahel vegetation growth, potentially contributing to the positive vegetation-rainfall feedback.

J	Schneider, T				Schneider, Tapio			Feedback of Atmosphere-Ocean Coupling on Shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MEDIATED REGIME TRANSITIONS; ENERGY FLUX EQUATOR; HEAT-TRANSPORT; INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; HADLEY CIRCULATIONS; TROPICAL RAINFALL; SEASONAL CYCLE; ITCZ LOCATION; PART II	It is well known that the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts in response to remote perturbations in the atmospheric energy balance, with shifts roughly in proportion to changes in the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux. However, atmospheric and oceanic energy fluxes in low latitudes are mechanically coupled, and the oceanic energy flux dominates the atmospheric energy flux. Here a quantitative framework is derived that shows how Ekman coupling of atmospheric and oceanic energy fluxes damps the perturbation response of the atmospheric energy flux, energy flux equator (EFE), and ITCZ. To first order, Ekman coupling alone mutes the response of EFE and ITCZ in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system by a factor gamma = 1 + O-0/NEI0, where O-0 is the ocean energy uptake and NEI0 is the net energy input into the atmosphere at the equator. In the current climate in the zonal and annual mean, this factor is about gamma approximate to 3.

Algae Drive Enhanced Darkening of Bare Ice on the Greenland Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ABLATION ZONE; BLACK-CARBON; DARK REGION; MASS-LOSS; SURFACE; ALBEDO; CRYOCONITE; DUST; MELT; PARTICLES	Surface ablation of the Greenland ice sheet is amplified by surface darkening caused by light-absorbing impurities such as mineral dust, black carbon, and pigmented microbial cells. We present the first quantitative assessment of the microbial contribution to the ice sheet surface darkening, based on field measurements of surface reflectance and concentrations of light-absorbing impurities, including pigmented algae, during the 2014 melt season in the southwestern part of the ice sheet. The impact of algae on bare ice darkening in the study area was greater than that of nonalgal impurities and yielded a net albedo reduction of 0.038 +/- 0.0035 for each algal population doubling. We argue that algal growth is a crucial control of bare ice darkening, and incorporating the algal darkening effect will improve mass balance and sea level projections of the Greenland ice sheet and ice masses elsewhere. Plain Language Summary Melting of the Greenland ice sheet is enhanced by surface darkening caused by various impurities. We quantified the contribution of dark pigment-producing algae to the ice sheet surface darkening, based on field measurements in the southwestern part of the ice sheet during the 2014 melt season. Our analysis reveals that the impact of algae on bare (snow-free) ice darkening was greater than that of other impurities and, therefore, that algal growth was a crucial control of bare ice darkening in the study area. Incorporating the darkening effect of algal growth is expected to improve future projections of the Greenland ice sheet melting.

Seasonality of Formic Acid (HCOOH) in London during the ClearfLo Campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						Clean Air for London; formic acid; ozonolysis; Criegee intermediate; chemical ionization mass spectrometry; air quality	IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; CRIEGEE INTERMEDIATE CH2OO; VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; TORCH 2003 CAMPAIGN; ACETIC-ACIDS; REGIONAL-SCALE; CRI MECHANISM; EMISSIONS; HYDROCARBONS; OZONOLYSIS	Following measurements in the winter of 2012, formic acid (HCOOH) and nitric acid (HNO3) were measured using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) during the Summer Clean Air for London (ClearfLo) campaign in London, 2012. Consequently, the seasonal dependence of formic acid sources could be better understood. A mean formic acid concentration of 1.3ppb and a maximum of 12.7ppb was measured which is significantly greater than that measured during the winter campaign (0.63ppb and 6.7ppb, respectively). Daily calibrations of formic acid during the summer campaign gave sensitivities of 1.2ion countss(-1)parts per trillion (ppt) by volume(-1) and a limit of detection of 34ppt. During the summer campaign, there was no correlation between formic acid and anthropogenic emissions such as NOx and CO or peaks associated with the rush hour as was identified in the winter. Rather, peaks in formic acid were observed that correlated with solar irradiance. Analysis using a photochemical trajectory model has been conducted to determine the source of this formic acid. The contribution of formic acid formation through ozonolysis of alkenes is important but the secondary production from biogenic VOCs could be the most dominant source of formic acid at this measurement site during the summer.

Planck Collaboration	Planck intermediate results LII. Planet flux densities	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; planets and satellites: general	BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE SPECTRA; NEAR-MILLIMETER; MICROWAVE; CALIBRATION; URANUS; MARS; WAVELENGTH; JUPITER; SATURN; RADIATION	Measurements of flux density are described for five planets, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, across the six Planck High Frequency Instrument frequency bands (100-857 GHz) and these are then compared with models and existing data. In our analysis, we have also included estimates of the brightness of Jupiter and Saturn at the three frequencies of the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz). The results provide constraints on the intrinsic brightness and the brightness time-variability of these planets. The majority of the planet flux density estimates are limited by systematic errors, but still yield better than 1% measurements in many cases. Applying data from Planck HFI, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to a model that incorporates contributions from Saturn's rings to the planet's total flux density suggests a best fit value for the spectral index of Saturn's ring system of beta(ring) = 2 : 30 +/- 0 : 03 over the 30-1000 GHz frequency range. Estimates of the polarization amplitude of the planets have also been made in the four bands that have polarization-sensitive detectors (100-353 GHz); this analysis provides a 95% confidence level upper limit on Mars's polarization of 1.8, 1.7, 1.2, and 1.7% at 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. The average ratio between the Planck-HFI measurements and the adopted model predictions for all five planets (excluding Jupiter observations for 353 GHz) is 1.004, 1.002, 1.021, and 1.033 for 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. Model predictions for planet thermodynamic temperatures are therefore consistent with the absolute calibration of Planck-HFI detectors at about the three-percent level. We compare our measurements with published results from recent cosmic microwave background experiments. In particular, we observe that the flux densities measured by Planck HFI and WMAP agree to within 2%. These results allow experiments operating in the mm-wavelength range to cross-calibrate against Planck and improve models of radiative transport used in planetary science.

Magnetic fields in circumstellar disks The potential of Zeeman observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; line: profiles; magnetic fields; polarization; radiative transfer	MOLECULAR CLOUDS; STAR-FORMATION; BINARY-SYSTEMS; YOUNG STARS; SUBMILLIMETER; DISTRIBUTIONS	Context. Recent high angular resolution polarimetric continuum observations of circumstellar disks provide new insights into their magnetic field. However, direct constraints are limited to the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field. Observations of Zeeman split spectral lines are a potential way to enhance these insights by providing complementary information. Aims. We investigate which constraints for magnetic fields in circumstellar disks can be obtained from Zeeman observations of the 113 GHz CN lines. Furthermore, we analyze the conditions needed to perform these observations and their dependence on selected quantities. Methods. We simulate the Zeeman splitting with the radiative transfer (RT) code POLARIS extended by our Zeeman splitting RT extension ZRAD, which is based on the line RT code Mol3D. Results. We find that Zeeman observations of the 113 GHz CN lines provide significant insights into the magnetic fields of circumstellar disks. However, with the capabilities of recent and upcoming instruments and observatories, even spatially unresolved observations would be challenging. Nevertheless, these observations are feasible for the most massive disks with a strong magnetic field and high abundance of CN /H. The most restrictive quantity is the magnetic field strength, which should be at least on the order of similar to 1 mG. In addition, the inclination of the disk should be around 60 degrees to preserve the ability to derive the line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field strength and to obtain a sufficiently high circularly polarized flux. Finally, we simulate the RT of a circumbinary disk model based on a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. We find that our analysis of the magnetic field is still applicable. However, owing to their lower circularly polarized emission, Zeeman observations of circumbinary disks with a significant separation between their stellar components (r(star) similar to 10AU) are more challenging than observations of circumstellar disks with a single star.

A Comparison of Cosmological Parameters Determined from CMB Temperature Power Spectra from the South Pole Telescope and the &ITPlanck&IT Satellite	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations		The Planck cosmic microwave background temperature data are best fit with a Lambda CDM model that mildly contradicts constraints from other cosmological probes. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) 2540 deg(2) SPT-SZ survey offers measurements on sub-degree angular scales (multipoles 650 <= l <= 2500) with sufficient precision to use as an independent check of the Planck data. Here we build on the recent joint analysis of the SPT-SZ and Planck data in Hou et al. by comparing Lambda CDM parameter estimates using the temperature power spectrum from both data sets in the SPT-SZ survey region. We also restrict the multipole range used in parameter fitting to focus on modes measured well by both SPT and Planck, thereby greatly reducing sample variance as a driver of parameter differences and creating a stringent test for systematic errors. We find no evidence of systematic errors from these tests. When we expand the maximum multipole of SPT data used, we see low-significance shifts in the angular scale of the sound horizon and the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities, with a resulting trend to higher Hubble constant. When we compare SPT and Planck data on the SPT-SZ sky patch to Planck full-sky data but keep the multipole range restricted, we find differences in the parameters n(s) and A(s)e(-2 tau). We perform further checks, investigating instrumental effects and modeling assumptions, and we find no evidence that the effects investigated are responsible for any of the parameter shifts. Taken together, these tests reveal no evidence for systematic errors in SPT or Planck data in the overlapping sky coverage and multipole range and at most weak evidence for a breakdown of Lambda CDM or systematic errors influencing either the Planck data outside the SPT-SZ survey area or the SPT data at l > 2000.

Using the archival Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the newly released NEOWISE data, we found that PS16dtm is experiencing a mid-infrared (MIR) flare that started similar to 11 days before the first optical detection. Interpreting the MIR flare as a dust echo requires close pre-existing dust with a high covering factor and suggests that the optical flare may have brightened slowly for some time before it became bright detectable from the ground. More evidence is given at the later epochs. At the peak of the optical light curve, the new inner radius of the dust torus has grown to a much larger size (i.e., a factor of seven of the initial radius) due to the strong radiation field. At similar to 150 days after the first optical detection, the dust temperature has dropped well below the sublimation temperature. Other peculiar spectral features shown by PS16dtm are the transient, prominent Fe II emission lines and outflows indicated by broad absorption lines detected during the optical flare. Our model explains the enhanced Fe II. emission from iron that is newly released from the evaporated dust. The observed broad absorption line outflow could be explained by accelerated gas in the dust torus due to the radiation pressure.

I. Spectral Measurements, Derived Quantities, and AGN Demographics	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; X-RAY SOURCES; PEAKED EMISSION-LINES; EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; INTEGRAL OBJECTS; ACCRETION DISK; HOST GALAXIES	We present the first catalog and data release of the Swift-BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. We analyze optical spectra of the majority of the detected AGNs (77%, 642/836)based on their 14-195 keV emission in the 70-month Swift-BAT all-sky catalog. This includes redshift determination, absorption and emission-line measurements, and black hole mass and accretion rate estimates for the majority of obscured and unobscured AGNs (74%, 473/642), with 340 measured for the first time. With-90% of sources at z < 0.2, the survey represents a significant advance in the census of hard X-ray-selected AGNs in the local universe. In this first catalog paper, we describe the spectroscopic observations and data sets, and our initial spectral analysis. The FWHMs of the emission lines show broad agreement with the X-ray obscuration (similar to 94%), such that Sy 1-1.8 have N-H < 10(21.9) cm(-2), and Seyfert 2 have N-H > 10(21.9) cm(-2). Seyfert 1.9, however, show a range of column densities. Compared to narrow-line AGNs in the SDSS, the X-ray-selected AGNs have a larger fraction of dusty host galaxies (H alpha/H beta > 5), suggesting that these types of AGN are missed in optical surveys. Using the [O III] lambda 5007/H beta and [N lambda 6583/H alpha emission-line diagnostic, about half of the sources are classified as Seyferts similar to 15% reside in dusty galaxies that lack an H beta detection, but for which the upper limits on line emission imply either a Seyfert or LINER similar to 15% are in galaxies with weak or no emission lines despite high-quality spectra, and a few percent each are LINERS, composite galaxies, H II regions, or in known beamed AGNs.

A Multi-telescope Campaign on FRB 121102: Implications for the FRB Population	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						radio continuum: stars; stars: neutron; supernovae: general; techniques: interferometric	FAST RADIO-BURSTS; GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; REIONIZATION HISTORY; SUPERGIANT PULSES; NEUTRON-STARS; GIANT PULSES; CRAB PULSAR; HOST GALAXY; CONNECTION; SUPERNOVAE	We present results of the coordinated observing campaign that made the first subarcsecond localization of a fast radio burst, FRB 121102. During this campaign, we made the first simultaneous detection of an FRB burst using multiple telescopes: the VLA at 3 GHz and the Arecibo Observatory at 1.4 GHz. Of the nine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous observing coverage at other observatories at frequencies from 70. MHz to 15 GHz. The one multi-observatory detection and three non-detections of bursts seen at 3 GHz confirm earlier results showing that burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst spectra are characterized by a similar to 500. MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as high as 10(40). erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent dispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent profiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error to the estimate of dispersion measure by up to 1%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB class to estimate a volumetric birth rate of FRB sources R-FRB approximate to 5 x 10(-5)/N-r Mpc(-3) yr(-1), where N-r is the number of bursts per source over its lifetime. This rate is broadly consistent with models of FRBs from young pulsars or magnetars born in superluminous supernovae or long gamma-ray bursts if the typical FRB repeats on the order of thousands of times during its lifetime.

Equilibrium Shapes of Large Trans-Neptunian Objects	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitation; methods: numerical; minor planets, asteroids: general	CENTAURS; SYSTEM	The large trans-Neptunian objects (TNO) with radii larger than 400 km are thought to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Their shapes can provide clues regarding their internal structures that would reveal information on their formation and evolution. In this paper, we explore the equilibrium figures of five TNOs, and we show that the difference between the equilibrium figures of homogeneous and heterogeneous interior models can reach several kilometers for fast rotating and low density bodies. Such a difference could be measurable by ground-based techniques. This demonstrates the importance of developing the shape up to second and third order when modeling the shapes of large and rapid rotators.

The Green Bank Ammonia Survey: Observations of Hierarchical Dense Gas Structures in Cepheus-L1251	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						ISM: kinematics and dynamics; ISM: structure; stars: formation	GOULD BELT SURVEY; YOUNG STELLAR OBJECT; DARK CLOUD CORES; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; STAR-FORMATION; SCUBA-2 OBSERVATIONS; FLARE REGION; L1251; TURBULENCE; STABILITY	We use Green Bank Ammonia Survey observations of NH3 (1, 1) and (2, 2) emission with 32 '' FWHM resolution from a similar to 10 pc(2) portion of the Cepheus-L1251 molecular cloud to identify hierarchical dense gas structures. Our dendrogram analysis of the NH3 data results in 22 top-level structures, which reside within 13 lower-level parent structures. The structures are compact(0.01 pc less than or similar to R-eff less than or similar to 0.1 pc) and are spatially correlated with the highest H-2 column density portions of the cloud. We also compare the ammonia data to a catalog of dense cores identified by higher-resolution (18.'' 2 FWHM) Herschel Space Observatory observations of dust continuum emission from Cepheus-L1251. Maps of kinetic gas temperature, velocity dispersion, and NH3 column density, derived from detailed modeling of the NH3 data, are used to investigate the stability and chemistry of the ammonia-identified and Herschel-identified structures. We show that the dust and dense gas in the structures have similar temperatures, with median T-dust and T-K measurements of 11.7 +/- 1.1 K and 10.3 +/- 2.0 K, respectively. Based on a virial analysis, we find that the ammonia-identified structures are gravitationally dominated, yet may be in or near a state of virial equilibrium. Meanwhile, the majority of the Herschel-identified dense cores appear to be not bound by their own gravity and instead confined by external pressure. CCS (2(0) -1(0)) and HC5N (9-8) emission from the region reveal broader line widths and centroid velocity offsets when compared to the NH3 (1, 1) emission in some cases, likely due to these carbon-based molecules tracing the turbulent outer layers of the dense cores.

Features in the cosmic microwave background temperature power spectrum and shifts in cosmological parameters	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmology: observations; cosmic background radiation; cosmological parameters; cosmology: theory	PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; CMB ANISOTROPIES; APPROXIMATION; RADIATION	The six parameters of the standard Lambda CDM model have best-fit values derived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat from the best-fit values derived from WMAP data. These shifts are driven by features in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had never before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We have investigated these shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and to understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the optical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium tau, the baryon density omega(b), the matter density omega(m), the angular size of the sound horizon theta(*), the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, n(s), and A(s)e(-2 pi) (where As is the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum), we have examined the change in best-fit values between a WMAP-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment l < 800 in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale data set (l < 2500 Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on tau of 0.07 +/- 0.02. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1 sigma expected dispersion for each parameter, are {Delta tau, Delta A(s)e(-2 tau), Delta n(s), Delta omega(m), Delta omega(b), Delta theta(*)} = {-1.7, -2.2, 1.2, 2.0, 1.1, 0.9}, with a chi(2) value of 8.0. We find that this chi(2) value is exceeded in 15% of our simulated data sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2 sigma in 9% of simulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing l < 800 instead to l > 800, or splitting at a different multipole, yields similar results. We examined the l < 800 model residuals in the l > 800 power spectrum data and find that the features there that drive these shifts are a set of oscillations across a broad range of angular scales. Although they partly appear similar to the effects of enhanced gravitational lensing, the shifts in Lambda CDM parameters that arise in response to these features correspond to model spectrum changes that are predominantly due to non-lensing effects; the only exception is tau, which, at fixed A(s)e(-2 tau), affects the l > 800 temperature power spectrum solely through the associated change in As and the impact of that on the lensing potential power spectrum. We also ask, "what is it about the power spectrum at l < 800 that leads to somewhat different best-fit parameters than come from the full l range?" We find that if we discard the data at l < 30, where there is a roughly 2 sigma downward fluctuation in power relative to the model that best fits the full l range, the l < 800 best-fit parameters shift significantly towards the l < 2500 best-fit parameters. In contrast, including l < 30, this previously noted "low-l deficit" drives ns up and impacts parameters correlated with ns, such as omega(m) and H-0. As expected, the l < 30 data have a much greater impact on the l < 800 best fit than on the l < 2500 best fit. So although the shifts are not very significant, we find that they can be understood through the combined effects of an oscillatory-like set of high-l residuals and the deficit in low-l power, excursions consistent with sample variance that happen to map onto changes in cosmological parameters. Finally, we examine agreement between Planck TT data and two other CMB data sets, namely the Planck lensing reconstruction and the TT power spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope, again finding a lack of convincing evidence of any significant deviations in parameters, suggesting that current CMB data sets give an internally consistent picture of the Lambda CDM model.

Consequently, number counts derived from low-and high-angular-resolution observations are in tension. This demonstrates the importance of resolution effects at these wavelengths and the need for realistic simulations to explore them. We built a new 2 deg(2) simulation of the extragalactic sky from the far-infrared to the submillimeter. It is based on an updated version of the 2SFM (two star-formation modes) galaxy evolution model. Using global galaxy properties generated by this model, we used an abundance-matching technique to populate a dark-matter lightcone and thus simulate the clustering. We produced maps from this simulation and extracted the sources, and we show that the limited angular resolution of single-dish instruments has a strong impact on (sub) millimeter continuum observations. Taking into account these resolution effects, we are reproducing a large set of observables, as number counts and their evolution with redshift and cosmic infrared background power spectra. Our simulation consistently describes the number counts from single-dish telescopes and interferometers. In particular, at 350 and 500 mu m, we find that the number counts measured by Herschel between 5 and 50 mJy are biased towards high values by a factor similar to 2, and that the redshift distributions are biased towards low redshifts. We also show that the clustering has an important impact on the Herschel pixel histogram used to derive number counts from P(D) analysis. We find that the brightest galaxy in the beam of a 500 mu m Herschel source contributes on average to only similar to 60% of the Herschel flux density, but that this number will rise to similar to 95% for future millimeter surveys on 30 m-class telescopes (e.g., NIKA2 at IRAM). Finally, we show that the large number density of red Herschel sources found in observations but not in models might be an observational artifact caused by the combination of noise, resolution effects, and the steepness of color-and flux density distributions. Our simulation, called Simulated Infrared Dusty Extragalactic Sky (SIDES), is publicly available.

The Putative Cerean Exosphere	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual (Ceres); molecular processes; solid state: volatile	LUNAR ATMOSPHERE; POLAR-REGIONS; WATER REGIME; SURFACE; MOON; ICE; SUBLIMATION; TEMPERATURE; CRATERS; HISTORY	The ice-rich crust of dwarf planet 1 Ceres is the source of a tenuous water exosphere, and the behavior of this putative exosphere is investigated with model calculations. Outgassing water molecules seasonally condense around the winter pole in an optically thin layer. This seasonal cap reaches an estimated mass of at least 2 x 10(3) kg, and the aphelion summer pole may even retain water throughout summer. If this reservoir is suddenly released by a solar energetic particle event, it would form a denser transient water exosphere. Our model calculations also explore species other than H2O. Light exospheric species escape rapidly from Ceres due to its low gravity, and hence their exospheres dissipate soon after their respective source has faded. For example, the theoretical turn-over time in a water exosphere is only 7 hr. A significant fraction of CO2 and SO2 molecules can get trapped and stored in perennially shadowed regions at the current spin axis orientation, but not at the higher spin axis tilt, leaving H2O as the only common volatile expected to accumulate in polar cold traps over long timescales. The D/H fractionation during migration to the cold traps is only about 10%.

We forecast how well different configurations of a CMB Stage-4 experiment can constrain cosmological parameters, in particular, the amplitude of structure as a function of redshift sigma(g)(z), the sum of neutrino masses Sigma m(nu), and the dark energy equation of state w(z). A key element of this effort is calibrating the tSZ scaling relation by measuring the lensing signal around clusters. We examine how the mass calibration from future optical surveys like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) compares with a purely internal calibration using lensing of the CMB itself. We find that, due to its high-redshift leverage, internal calibration gives constraints on cosmological parameters comparable to the optical calibration, and can be used as a cross-check of systematics in the optical measurement. We also show that in contrast to the constraints using the CMB lensing power spectrum, lensing-calibrated tSZ cluster counts can detect a minimal Sigma m(nu) at the 3-5 sigma level even when the dark energy equation of state is freed up.

With a heightened interest in understanding the impacts of a changing climate on snow and ice processes, quantifying the impact of biological impurities on ice and snow albedo ("bioalbedo") and its evolution through time is a rapidly growing field of research. However, rigorous quantification of bioalbedo has remained elusive because of difficulties in isolating the biological contribution to ice albedo from that of inorganic impurities and the variable optical properties of the ice itself. For this reason, isolation of the biological signature in reflectance data obtained from aerial/orbital platforms has not been achieved, even when ground-based biological measurements have been available. This paper provides the cell-specific optical properties that are required to model the spectral signatures and broadband darkening of ice. Applying radiative transfer theory, these properties provide the physical basis needed to link biological and glaciological ground measurements with remotely sensed reflectance data. Using these new capabilities we confirm that biological impurities can influence ice albedo, then we identify 10 challenges to the measurement of bioalbedo in the field with the aim of improving future experimental designs to better quantify bioalbedo feedbacks. These challenges are (1) ambiguity in terminology, (2) characterising snow or ice optical properties, (3) characterising solar irradiance, (4) determining optical properties of cells, (5) measuring biomass, (6) characterising vertical distribution of cells, (7) characterising abiotic impurities, (8) surface anisotropy, (9) measuring indirect albedo feedbacks, and (10) measurement and instrument configurations. This paper aims to provide a broad audience of glaciologists and biologists with an overview of radiative transfer and albedo that could support future experimental design.

PINATUBO; ERUPTION; CLIMATE; CLOUDS; MODEL; LAYER	The Southern Hemisphere Antarctic stratosphere experienced two noteworthy events in 2015: a significant injection of sulfur from the Calbuco volcanic eruption in Chile in April and a record-large Antarctic ozone hole in October and November. Here we quantify Calbuco's influence on stratospheric ozone depletion in austral spring 2015 using observations and an Earth system model. We analyze ozonesondes, as well as data from the Microwave Limb Sounder. We employ the Community Earth System Model, version 1, with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) in a specified dynamics setup, which includes calculations of volcanic effects. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization data indicate enhanced volcanic liquid sulfate 532 nm backscatter values as far poleward as 68 degrees S during October and November (in broad agreement with WACCM). Comparison of the location of the enhanced aerosols to ozone data supports the view that aerosols played a major role in increasing the ozone hole size, especially at pressure levels between 150 and 100 hPa. Ozonesonde vertical ozone profiles from the sites of Syowa, South Pole, and Neumayer display the lowest individual October or November measurements at 150 hPa since the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption period, with Davis showing similarly low values, but no available 1990 data. The analysis suggests that under the cold conditions ideal for ozone depletion, stratospheric volcanic aerosol particles from the moderate-magnitude eruption of Calbuco in 2015 greatly enhanced austral ozone depletion, particularly at 55-68 degrees S, where liquid binary sulfate aerosols have a large influence on ozone concentrations.

Ammonia in Jupiter's Troposphere From High-Resolution 5 mu m Spectroscopy	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; troposphere; composition; ammonia	CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; GAS-COMPOSITION; ISOTOPIC RATIO; OPACITY; ORIGIN; SATURN	Jupiter's tropospheric ammonia (NH3) abundance is studied using spatially resolved 5 mu m observations from the cryogenic high-resolution infrared spectrograph (CRIRES) at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. The high-resolving power (R = 96,000) allows the line shapes of three NH3 absorption features to be resolved. We find that within the 1-4 bar pressure range, the NH3 abundance decreases with altitude. The instrument slit was aligned north-south along Jupiter's central meridian, allowing us to search for latitudinal variability. There is considerable uncertainty in the large-scale latitudinal variability, as the increase in cloud opacity in zones compared to belts can mask absorption features. However, we do find evidence for a strong NH3 enhancement at 4-6 degrees N, consistent with a localized "ammonia plume" on the southern edge of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt.

Along the eastern boundary of the Pamir-Tian Shan collision zone, we constrain secular variations of rock uplift rates for a series of five Quaternary detachment- and fault-related folds from their initiation to the modern day. When combined with GPS data, decomposition of interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series constrains the spatial pattern of surface and rock uplift on the folds deforming at decadal rates of 1-5mm/yr. These data confirm the previously proposed basinward propagation of structures during the Quaternary. By fitting our geodetic rates and previously published geologic uplift rates with piecewise linear functions, we find that gradual rate changes over >100kyr can explain the interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations where changes in average uplift rates are greater than similar to 1 mm/yr among different time intervals (similar to 10(1), 10(4-5), and 10(5-6) years).

Infrared absorption spectrum of phenanthrene in an argon matrix	CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; TITANS ATMOSPHERE; SPECTROSCOPY; EMISSION; PROFILES; AEROSOLS; FLAME; PAHS	The far-to-mid infrared absorption spectrum of phenanthrene (C14H10) has been measured in an argon matrix at 5 K. Thirty-two fundamental bands have been observed; one is detected for the first time (v(54)) and eight are observed for the first time at temperatures below room temperature (v(43), v(42), v(66), v(65), v(21), v(63), v(18) and v(55)). The relative intensities of these 32 bands have been obtained; seven (v(42), v(66), v(65), v(21), v(18), v(55), v(54)) are measured for the first time and two (v(43), v(63)) are measured for the first time below room temperature.

The goal of our study is to derive the surface density profile of the inner disk and its structure. In addition to the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array images at Band 3 (2.9 mm), Band 6 (1.3 mm), and Band 7 (0.87 mm), the most recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 7mm were included in the analysis. A simulated annealing algorithm was invoked to search for the optimum model. The radiative transfer analysis demonstrates that most radial components (i.e., > 6AU) of the disk become optically thin at a wavelength of 7 mm, which allows us to constrain, for the first time, the dust density distribution in the inner region of the disk. We found that a homogeneous grain size distribution is not sufficient to explain the observed images at different wavelengths simultaneously, while models with a shallower grain size distribution in the inner disk work well. We found clear evidence that larger grains are trapped in the first bright ring. Our results imply that dust evolution has already taken place in the disk at a relatively young (i.e., similar to 1 Myr) age. We compared the midplane temperature distribution, optical depth, and properties of various dust rings with those reported previously. Using the Toomre parameter, we briefly discussed the gravitational instability as a potential mechanism for the origin of the dust clump detected in the first bright ring via the VLA observations.

BedMachine v3: Complete Bed Topography and Ocean Bathymetry Mapping of Greenland From Multibeam Echo Sounding Combined With Mass Conservation	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RESOLUTION ICE-THICKNESS; WEST GREENLAND; GLACIER DYNAMICS; CALVING FRONT; FJORD; SHEET; RETREAT; WATERS; SHELF; ANTARCTICA	Greenland's bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage. Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150m horizontal resolution bed topography/bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.420.05m, which is 7cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.

Here we model the response of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79North) and Zachariae IsstrOm (ZI) to ocean forcing to investigate their evolution over the coming decades. Our model suggests that 79North will retreat slowly over the next century, whereas ZI will lose its floating ice tongue completely and retreat rapidly for 70 years. After 70 years, ZI will stabilize 30 km upstream of its current position on a topographic ridge. Frontal melt rates need to reach 6 m/d in the summer to dislodge the glacier from this ridge. ZI will then continue a fast and unstoppable retreat, contributing more than 16.2 mm to global sea level rise by 2100.

Observations of Phobos by the Mars Express radar MARSIS: Description of the detection techniques and preliminary results	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Phobos; Mars; Radar; Mars Express ESA mission; MARSIS; Ground penetrating radar	IONOSPHERE; SUBSURFACE; SURFACE; DEIMOS; MODELS	The Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) (Picardi et al., 2005) is a synthetic aperture low frequency radar altimeter, onboard the ESA Mars Express orbiter, launched in June 2003. It is the first and so far the only spaceborne radar that has observed the Martian moon Phobos. Radar echoes were collected on different flyby trajectories. The primary aim of sounding Phobos is to prove the feasibility of deep sounding, into its subsurface. MARSIS is optimized for deep penetration investigations and is capable of transmitting at four different bands between 1.3 MHz and 5.5 MHz with a 1 MHz bandwidth. Unfortunately the instrument was originally designed to operate exclusively on Mars, assuming that Phobos would not be observed. Following this assumption, a protection mechanism was implemented in the hardware (HW) to maintain a minimum time separation between transmission and reception phases of the radar. This limitation does not have any impact on Mars observation but it prevented the observation of Phobos. In order to successfully operate the instrument at Phobos, a particular configuration of the MARSIS onboard software (SW) parameters, called "Range Ambiguity," was implemented to override the HW protection zone, ensuring at the same time a high level of safety of the instrument. This paper describes the principles of MARSIS onboard processing, and the procedure through which the parameters of the processing software were tuned to observe targets below the minimum distance allowed by hardware. Some preliminary results of data analysis will be shown, with the support of radar echo simulations. A qualitative comparison between the simulated results and the actual data, does not support the detection of subsurface reflectors. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inhibition of ordinary and diffusive convection in the water condensation zone of the ice giants an implications for their thermal evolution	ICARUS			English	Article							OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS; MIXED-LAYER; SOLAR PONDS; ATMOSPHERE; PLANETS; URANUS; SIMULATIONS; INTERFACE; DYNAMICS; NEPTUNE	We explore the conditions under which ordinary and double-diffusive thermal convection may be inhibited by water condensation in the hydrogen atmospheres of the ice giants and examine the consequences. The saturation of vapor in the condensation layer induces a vertical gradient in the mean molecular weight that stabilizes the layer against convective instability when the abundance of vapor exceeds a critical value. In this instance, the layer temperature gradient can become superadiabatic and heat must be transported vertically by another mechanism. On Uranus and Neptune, water is inferred to be sufficiently abundant for inhibition of ordinary convection to take place in their respective condensation zones. We find that suppression of double-diffusive convection is sensitive to the ratio of the sedimentation time scale of the condensates to the buoyancy period in the condensation layer. In the limit of rapid sedimentation, the layer is found to be stable to diffusive convection. In the opposite limit, diffusive convection can occur. However, if the fluid remains saturated, then layered convection is generally suppressed and the motion is restricted in form to weak, homogeneous, oscillatory turbulence. This form of diffusive convection is a relatively inefficient mechanism for transporting heat, characterized by low Nusselt numbers. When both ordinary and layered convection are suppressed, the condensation zone acts effectively as a thermal insulator, with the heat flux transported across it only slightly greater than the small value that can be supported by radiative diffusion. This may allow a large superadiabatic temperature gradient to develop in the layer over time. Once the layer has formed, however, it is vulnerable to persistent erosion by entrainment of fluid into the overlying convective envelope of the cooling planet, potentially leading to its collapse. We discuss the implications of our results for thermal evolution models of the ice giants, for understanding Uranus' anomalously low intrinsic luminosity, and for inducing episodes of intense convection in the atmospheres of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

J	de Pater, I; de Kleer, K; Davies, AG; Adamkovics, M				de Pater, Imke; de Kleer, Katherine; Davies, Ashley G.; Adamkovics, Mate			Three decades of Loki Patera observations	ICARUS			English	Article						Io; Infrared Observations; Volcanism	ADAPTIVE OPTICS OBSERVATIONS; GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS; IOS VOLCANIC ACTIVITY; STANDARD STARS; ROVIBRONIC TRANSITION; THERMAL SIGNATURE; TIME VARIABILITY; 100 NIGHTS; MU-M; KECK	We present observations of Io's Loki Patera taken with the 10-m Keck telescopes between 1998 and 2016. Adding these data to those published by Rathbun and Spencer (2006) and the Gemini data of de Kleer and de Pater (2016a, 2017) results in a database of 3.5-3.8 mu m emission from Loki Patera over almost 3 decades. Data presented here contain adaptive optics (AO) observations of Io's sunlit hemisphere at wave-lengths between 1.6 and 5 mu m, AO observations of Io in eclipse at 2-5 mu m, and non-AO observations of Io in eclipse at 1.6-12 mu m. The non-AO data were taken in September of 1999, during the early phase of a brightening event that was documented by Howell et al. (2001). Dual-component Io Flow model (IFM) fits to our 1999 observations show a mostly cool lava crust over almost the entire patera floor, with a relatively small hotter component making up less than 1% of the total area, consistent with previous observations. The 30-year timeline of Loki Patera revealed that, after an apparent cessation of, or change in, brightening events in 2002, Loki Patera became active again in 2009. The more recent activity may have a slightly shorter periodicity than observed by Rathbun et al. (2002), and the direction of flow propagation appears to have reversed. Since 2009 the flow direction is in the clockwise direction, starting in the north or north-east corner and propagating along the patera towards the south-west. During the Galileo era the propagation was in the counter-clockwise direction, starting in the south-west and propagating towards the east. Both the 30-year timeline and the 1.6-12 mu m spectrum that was obtained during the brightening event in 1999 agree well with Matson et al.'s (2006) overturning lava lake model, as modified by de Kleer and de Pater (2017).

One drawback of LULCC emissions from DGVMs, however, is lack of observation constraint. Here, we propose a new method of using satellite-and inventory-based biomass observations to constrain historical cumulative LULCC emissions (E-LUC(c)) from an ensemble of nine DGVMs based on emerging relationships between simulated vegetation biomass and E-LUC(c). This method is applicable on the global and regional scale. The original DGVM estimates of E-LUC(c) range from 94 to 273 PgC during 1901-2012. After constraining by current biomass observations, we derive a best estimate of 155 +/- 50 PgC (1 sigma Gaussian error). The constrained LULCC emissions are higher than prior DGVM values in tropical regions but significantly lower in North America. Our emergent constraint approach independently verifies the median model estimate by biomass observations, giving support to the use of this estimate in carbon budget assessments. The uncertainty in the constrained Ec LUC is still relatively large because of the uncertainty in the biomass observations, and thus reduced uncertainty in addition to increased accuracy in biomass observations in the future will help improve the constraint. This constraint method can also be applied to evaluate the impact of land-based mitigation activities.

Ionized gas in the Scutum spiral arm as traced in [N II] and [C II]	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: clouds; ISM: structure; photon-dominated region (PDR); infrared: ISM	GALACTIC RING SURVEY; EMISSION; REGIONS	Context. The warm ionized medium (WIM) occupies a significant fraction of the Galactic disk. Determining the WIM properties at the leading edge of spiral arms is important for understanding its dynamics and cloud formation. Aims. We derive the properties of the WIM at the inner edge of the Scutum arm tangency, which is a unique location in which to disentangle the WIM from other components, using the ionized gas tracers C+ and N+. M Methods. We use high spectral resolution [C II] 158 mu m and [N II] 205 mu m fine structure line observations taken with the upGREAT and GREAT instruments, respectively, on SOFIA, along with auxiliary H I and (CO)-C-13 observations. The observations consist of samples in and out of the Galactic plane along 18 lines of sight (LOS) between longitude 30 degrees and 32 degrees. Results. We detect strong [N II] emission throughout the Scutum tangency. At V-LSR = 110 to 125 km s(-1) where there is little, if any, 13CO, we are able to disentangle the [N II] and [C II] emission that arises from the WIM at the arm's inner edge. We find an average electron density similar to 0.9 cm(-3) in the plane, and similar to 0.4 cm(-3) just above the plane. The [N II] emission decreases exponentially with latitude with a scale height similar to 55 pc. For VLSR < 110 km s(-1) there is [N II] emission tracing highly ionized gas throughout the arm's molecular layer. This ionized gas has a high density, n(e) similar to 30 cm(-3), and a few percent filling factor. We also find evidence for [C II] absorption by foreground gas. Conclusions. [N II] and [C II] observations at the Scutum arm tangency reveal a highly ionized gas with average electron density about 10 to 20 times those of the interarm WIM, and is best explained by a model in which the interarm WIM is compressed as it falls into the potential well of the arm. The widespread distribution of [N II] in the molecular layers shows that high density ionized gas is distributed throughout the Scutum arm. The electron densities derived from [N II] for these molecular cloud regions are similar to 30 cm(-3), and probably arise in the ionized boundary layers of clouds. The [N II] detected in the molecular portion of the spiral arm arises from several cloud components with a combined total depth similar to 8 pc. This [N II] emission most likely arises from ionized boundary layers, probably the result of the shock compression of the WIM as it impacts the arm's neutral gas, as well as from extended H II regions.

Progressive improvements in radar hardware and data processing methodologies have led to improved data quality for subsequent retrieval of snow depth. Existing retrieval algorithms differ in the way the air-snow (a-s) and snow-ice (s-i) interfaces are detected and localized in the radar returns and in how the system limitations are addressed (e.g., noise, resolution). In 2014, the Snow Thickness On Sea Ice Working Group (STOSIWG) was formed and tasked with investigating how radar data quality affects snow depth retrievals and how retrievals from the various algorithms differ. The goal is to understand the limitations of the estimates and to produce a well-documented, long-term record that can be used for understanding broader changes in the Arctic climate system. Here, we assess five retrieval algorithms by comparisons with field measurements from two ground-based campaigns, including the BRomine, Ozone, and Mercury EXperiment (BROMEX) at Barrow, Alaska; a field program by Environment and Climate Change Canada at Eureka, Nunavut; and available climatology and snowfall from ERA-Interim reanalysis. The aim is to examine available algorithms and to use the assessment results to inform the development of future approaches. We present results from these assessments and highlight key considerations for the production of a long-term, calibrated geophysical record of springtime snow thickness over Arctic sea ice.

Mapping functional diversity from remotely sensed morphological and physiological forest traits	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SPECIES RICHNESS; PRODUCTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; APPROACH REVEALS; CANOPY-STRUCTURE; TREE GROWTH; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERGENCE; EVENNESS; INDEXES	Assessing functional diversity from space can help predict productivity and stability of forest ecosystems at global scale using biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. We present a new spatially continuous method to map regional patterns of tree functional diversity using combined laser scanning and imaging spectroscopy. The method does not require prior taxonomic information and integrates variation in plant functional traits between and within plant species. We compare our method with leaf-level field measurements and species-level plot inventory data and find reasonable agreement. Morphological and physiological diversity show consistent change with topography and soil, with low functional richness at a mountain ridge under specific environmental conditions. Overall, functional richness follows a logarithmic increase with area, whereas divergence and evenness are scale invariant. By mapping diversity at scales of individual trees to whole communities we demonstrate the potential of assessing functional diversity from space, providing a pathway only limited by technological advances and not by methodology.

First &ITNuSTAR&IT Limits on Quiet Sun Hard X-Ray Transient Events	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Sun: flares; Sun: X-rays, gamma rays	RHESSI MICROFLARE STATISTICS; FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; SOLAR; FLARES; SPECTROSCOPY; NANOFLARES; ENERGETICS; CORONA	We present the first results of a search for transient hard X-ray (HXR) emission in the quiet solar corona with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR ) satellite. While NuSTAR was designed as an astrophysics mission, it can observe the Sun above 2 keV with unprecedented sensitivity due to its pioneering use of focusing optics. NuSTAR first observed quiet-Sun regions on 2014 November 1, although out-of-view active regions contributed a notable amount of background in the form of single-bounce (unfocused) X-rays. We conducted a search for quiet-Sun transient brightenings on timescales of 100 s and set upper limits on emission in two energy bands. We set 2.5-4 keV limits on brightenings with timescales of 100 s, expressed as the temperature T and emission measure EM of a thermal plasma. We also set 10-20 keV limits on brightenings with timescales of 30, 60, and 100 s, expressed as model-independent photon fluxes. The limits in both bands are well below previous HXR microflare detections, though not low enough to detect events of equivalent T and EM as quiet-Sun brightenings seen in soft X-ray observations. We expect future observations during solar minimum to increase the NuSTAR sensitivity by over two orders of magnitude due to higher instrument livetime and reduced solar background.

A 2500 deg(2) CMB Lensing Map from Combined South Pole Telescope and Planck Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; gravitational lensing: weak; large-scale structure of universe	CLUSTERS; PHYSICS; PROBE	We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing map produced from a linear combination of South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck temperature data. The 150 GHz temperature data from the 2500 deg(2) SPT-SZ survey is combined with the Planck 143 GHz data in harmonic space to obtain a temperature map that has a broader l coverage and less noise than either individual map. Using a quadratic estimator technique on this combined temperature map, we produce a map of the gravitational lensing potential projected along the line of sight. We measure the auto-spectrum of the lensing potential C-L(phi phi), and compare it to the theoretical prediction for a.CDM cosmology consistent with the Planck 2015 data set, finding a best-fit amplitude of 0.95(-0.06)(+0.06) (stat.)(-0.01)(+0.01)+ (sys.). The null hypothesis of no lensing is rejected at a significance of 24 sigma. One important use of such a lensing potential map is in cross-correlations with other dark matter tracers. We demonstrate this cross-correlation in practice by calculating the cross-spectrum, C-L(phi) G, between the SPT+ Planck lensing map and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) galaxies. We fit C-L(phi G) to a power law of the form p(L) = a(L/L-0)(-b) with a, L-0, and b fixed, and find eta(phi G) = C-L(phi G)/p(L) = 0.94(-0.04)(+0.04), which is marginally lower, but in good agreement with eta(phi G) = 1.00-(+0.02)(0.01), the best-fit amplitude for the cross-correlation of Planck-2015 CMB lensing and WISE galaxies over similar to 67% of the sky. The lensing potential map presented here will be used for cross-correlation studies with the Dark Energy Survey, whose footprint nearly completely covers the SPT 2500 deg(2) field.

An Active Galactic Nucleus Caught in the Act of Turning Off and On	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei	EMISSION-LINE SPECTRA; BLACK-HOLE GROWTH; X-RAY-SPECTRA; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION; IMAGING SURVEY; HOST GALAXIES; CLASSIFICATION; FEEDBACK; RADIO	We present the discovery of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is turning off and then on again in the z = 0.06 galaxy SDSS J1354+1327. This episodic nuclear activity is the result of discrete accretion events that could have been triggered by a past interaction with the companion galaxy that is currently located 12.5. kpc away. We originally targeted SDSS J1354+1327 because its Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum has narrow AGN emission lines that exhibit a velocity offset of 69. km. s(-1) relative to systemic. To determine the nature of the galaxy and its velocity-offset emission lines, we observed SDSS J1354+1327 with Chandra/ACIS, Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3, Apache Point Observatory optical longslit spectroscopy, and Keck/OSIRIS integral-field spectroscopy. We find a similar to 10 kpc cone of photoionized gas south of the galaxy center and a similar to 1 kpc semi-spherical front of shocked gas, which is responsible for the velocity offset in the emission lines, north of the galaxy center. We interpret these two outflows as the result of two separate AGN accretion events: the first AGN outburst created the southern outflow, and then < 10(5) years later, the second AGN outburst launched the northern shock front. SDSS J1354+1327 is the galaxy with the strongest evidence for an AGN that has turned off and then on again, and it fits into the broader context of AGN flickering that includes observations of AGN light echoes.

III. Observational Signatures in Thermal Emission and Scattered Light	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planet-disk interactions; planets and satellites: formation; protoplanetary disks; radiative transfer; shock waves; stars: individual (HD 100546)	ACCRETION DISKS; GAS	Recent observations of the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig Be star HD 100546 show two bright features in infrared (H and L' bands) at about 50 au, with one so far unexplained. We explore the observational signatures of a high-mass planet causing shock heating in order to determine if it could be the source of the. unexplained infrared feature in HD 100546. More fundamentally, we identify and characterize planetary shocks as an extra, hitherto ignored, source of luminosity in transition disks. The RADMC-3D code is used to perform dust radiative transfer calculations on the hydrodynamical disk models,. including volumetric heating. A stronger shock heating rate by a factor of 20. would be necessary. to. qualitatively reproduce the morphology of the second infrared source. Instead, we find that the outer. edge of the gap carved by the planet heats up by about 50% relative to the initial reference temperature, which leads to an increase in the scale height. The. bulge is illuminated by the central star, producing a lopsided feature in scattered light, as the outer gap edge shows an asymmetry in density and temperature. attributable to a secondary spiral arm launched not from the Lindblad resonances but from the 2: 1. resonance. We conclude that high-mass planets lead to shocks in disks that may be. directly observed,. particularly at wavelengths of 10. mu m or longer,. but that they are more likely to reveal their presence in scattered light by puffing up their outer gap edges and exciting multiple spiral arms.

Physical Properties of 15 Quasars at z greater than or similar to 6.5	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: high-redshift; quasars: general	BLACK-HOLE MASSES; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; EMISSION-LINE RATIOS; HIGH-REDSHIFT; II EMISSION; MU-M; Z-SIMILAR-TO-6 QUASARS; STAR-FORMATION; RAPID GROWTH	Quasars are galaxies hosting accreting supermassive black holes; due to their brightness, they are unique probes of the early universe. To date, only a few quasars have been reported at z > 6.5 (< 800 Myr after the big bang). In this work, we present six additional z greater than or similar to 6.5 quasars discovered using the Pan-STARRS1 survey. We use a sample of 15 z greater than or similar to 6.5 quasars to perform a homogeneous and comprehensive analysis of this highest-redshift quasar population. We report four main results: (1) the majority of z greater than or similar to 6.5 quasars show large blueshifts of the broad C IV lambda 1549 emission line compared to the systemic redshift of the quasars, with a median value similar to 3x higher than a quasar sample at z similar to 1; (2) we estimate the quasars' black hole masses (M-BH similar to (0.3-5) x. 10(9) M circle dot) via modeling of the Mg II lambda 2798 emission line and rest-frame UV continuum and find that quasars at high redshift accrete their material (with <(Lbol L-Edd)> = 0.39) at a rate comparable to a luminosity-matched sample at lower redshift, albeit with significant scatter (0.4 dex); (3) we recover no evolution of the Fe II/Mg II abundance ratio with cosmic time; and (4) we derive near-zone sizes and, together with measurements for z similar to 6 quasars from recent work, confirm a shallow evolution of the decreasing quasar near-zone sizes with redshift. Finally, we present new millimeter observations of the [C II] 158 mu m emission line and underlying dust continuum from NOEMA for four quasars and provide new accurate redshifts and [C II]/infrared luminosity estimates. The analysis presented here shows the large range of properties of the most distant quasars.	[Mazzucchelli, C.; Banados, E.; Venemans, B. P.; Decarli, R.; Farina, E.

Evidence for Dynamically Driven Formation of the GW170817 Neutron Star Binary in NGC 4993	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: individual (NGC 4993); galaxies: evolution; galaxies: structure; gravitational waves	STELLAR MASS; GALAXIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; SEXTRACTOR; REDSHIFTS; SPECTRA	We present a study of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of the GW170817 gravitational-wave event, the GRB 170817A short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), and the AT 2017gfo kilonova. We use Dark Energy Camera imaging, AAT spectra, and publicly available data, relating our findings to binary neutron star (BNS) formation scenarios and merger delay timescales. NGC 4993 is a nearby early-type galaxy, with an i-band Sersic index n = 4.0 and low asymmetry (A = 0.04 +/- 0.01). These properties are unusual for sGRB hosts. However, NGC 4993 presents shell-like structures and dust lanes indicative of a recent galaxy merger, with the optical transient located close to a shell. We constrain the star formation history (SFH) of the galaxy assuming that the galaxy merger produced a star formation burst, but find little to no ongoing star formation in either spatially resolved broadband SED or spectral fitting. We use the best-fit SFH to estimate the BNS merger rate in this type of galaxy, as R-NSM(gal) = 5.7(-3.3)(+0.57) x 10(-6) yr(-1). If star formation is the only considered BNS formation scenario, the expected number of BNS mergers from early-type galaxies detectable with LIGO during its first two observing seasons is 0.038(-0.022)(+0.004), as opposed to similar to 0.5 from all galaxy types. Hypothesizing that the binary formed due to dynamical interactions during the galaxy merger, the subsequent time elapsed can constrain the delay time of the BNS coalescence. By using velocity dispersion estimates and the position of the shells, we find that the galaxy merger occurred t(mer) less than or similar to 200 Myr prior to the BNS coalescence.

OGLE Collaboration; Spitzer Team; MOA Collaboration	An Isolated Microlens Observed from K2, Spitzer, and Earth	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; methods: data analysis; parallaxes; stars: fundamental parameters; techniques: photometric	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; GALACTIC BULGE; PARALLAXES; SATELLITE; DWARF	We present the result of microlensing event MOA-2016-BLG-290, which received observations from the two-wheel Kepler (K2), Spitzer, as well as ground-based observatories. A joint analysis of data from K2 and the ground leads to two degenerate solutions of the lens mass and distance. This degeneracy is effectively broken once the (partial) Spitzer light curve is included. Altogether, the lens is found to be an extremely low-mass star or brown dwarf (77(23)(+34) M-J) located in the Galactic bulge (6.8 +/- 0.4 kpc). MOA-2016-BLG-290 is the first microlensing event for which we have signals from three well-separated (similar to 1 au) locations. It demonstrates the power of two-satellite microlensing experiment in reducing the ambiguity of lens properties, as pointed out independently by S. Refsdal and A. Gould several decades ago.

Moreover, all supernovae with absorption lines in their spectra show those lines decreasing in velocity over time, as the ejecta expand and thin, revealing slower-moving material that was previously hidden. In addition, every supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has one main light-curve peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately 100 days before declining(1). Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event that has spectra identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but characteristics that differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The light curve has at least five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days; the absorption lines show little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of the line-forming region is more than an order of magnitude bigger than the radius of the photosphere derived from the continuum emission. These characteristics are consistent with a shell of several tens of solar masses ejected by the progenitor star at supernova-level energies a few hundred days before a terminal explosion. Another possible eruption was recorded at the same position in 1954. Multiple energetic pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in stars of 95 to 130 solar masses, which experience the pulsational pair instability(2-5). That model, however, does not account for the continued presence of hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. Another mechanism for the violent ejection of mass in massive stars may be required.

BICEP2 / Keck Array IX: New bounds on anisotropies of CMB polarization rotation and implications for axionlike particles and primordial magnetic fields	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We present the strongest constraints to date on anisotropies of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization rotation derived from 150 GHz data taken by the BICEP2 & Keck Array CMB experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). The definition of the polarization angle in BK14 maps has gone through self-calibration in which the overall angle is adjusted to minimize the observed TB and EB power spectra. After this procedure, the QU maps lose sensitivity to a uniform polarization rotation but are still sensitive to anisotropies of polarization rotation. This analysis places constraints on the anisotropies of polarization rotation, which could be generated by CMB photons interacting with axionlike pseudoscalar fields or Faraday rotation induced by primordial magnetic fields. The sensitivity of BK14 maps (similar to 3 mu K-arc min) makes it possible to reconstruct anisotropies of the polarization rotation angle and measure their angular power spectrum much more precisely than previous attempts. Our data are found to be consistent with no polarization rotation anisotropies, improving the upper bound on the amplitude of the rotation angle spectrum by roughly an order of magnitude compared to the previous best constraints. Our results lead to an order of magnitude better constraint on the coupling constant of the Chern-Simons electromagnetic term g(ar) <= 7.2 x 10(-2) / H-1 (95% confidence) than the constraint derived from the B-mode spectrum, where HI is the inflationary Hubble scale. This constraint leads to a limit on the decay constant of 10(-6) less than or similar to f(a) / M-pl at mass range of 10(-33) <= m(a) <= 10(-28) eV for r = 0.01, assuming g(ar) similar to alpha/(2 pi f(a)) with a denoting the fine structure constant. The upper bound on the amplitude of the primordial magnetic fields is 30 nG (95% confidence) from the polarization rotation anisotropies.	[Ade, P. A. R.; Sudiwala, R.

We describe the design and first light observations from the beta Pictoris b Ring ("bRing") project. The primary goal is to detect photometric variability from the young star beta Pictoris due to circumplanetary material surrounding the directly imaged young extrasolar gas giant planet beta Pictoris b. Methods. Over a nine month period centred on September 2017, the Hill sphere of the planet will cross in front of the star, providing a unique opportunity to directly probe the circumplanetary environment of a directly imaged planet through photometric and spectroscopic variations. We have built and installed the first of two bRing monitoring stations (one in South Africa and the other in Australia) that will measure the flux of beta Pictoris, with a photometric precision of 0 : 5% over 5 min. Each station uses two wide field cameras to cover the declination of the star at all elevations. Detection of photometric fluctuations will trigger spectroscopic observations with large aperture telescopes in order to determine the gas and dust composition in a system at the end of the planet-forming era. Results. The first three months of operation demonstrate that bRing can obtain better than 0.5% photometry on beta Pictoris in five minutes and is sensitive to nightly trends enabling the detection of any transiting material within the Hill sphere of the exoplanet.

Here, we produce for the first time the spatial patterns of carbon stored in forests of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by using airborne LiDAR inventory of more than 432,000 ha of forests based on a designed probability sampling methodology. The LiDAR mean top canopy height measurements were trained to develop an unbiased carbon estimator by using 92 1-ha ground plots distributed across key forest types in DRC. LiDAR samples provided estimates of mean and uncertainty of aboveground carbon density at provincial scales and were combined with optical and radar satellite imagery in a machine learning algorithm to map forest height and carbon density over the entire country. By using the forest definition of DRC, we found a total of 23.3 +/- 1.6 GtC carbon with a mean carbon density of 140 +/- 9 MgC ha(-1) in the aboveground and belowground live trees. The probability based LiDAR samples capture variations of structure and carbon across edaphic and climate conditions, and provide an alternative approach to national ground inventory for efficient and precise assessment of forest carbon resources for emission reduction (ER) programs.

This rate of relative sea level rise results from a combination of land subsidence, which has long been known to be present in the region, and rising seas associated with global warming on long timescales and exacerbated by shifts in ocean dynamics on shorter timescales. An understanding of the current-day magnitude of each component is needed to create accurate projections of future relative sea level rise upon which to base planning efforts. The objective of this study is to estimate the land component of relative sea level rise using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis applied to ALOS-1 synthetic aperture radar data acquired during 2007-2011 to generate high-spatial resolution (20-30 m) estimates of vertical land motion. Although these results are limited by the uncertainty associated with the small set of available historical SAR data, they highlight both localized rates of high subsidence and a significant spatial variability in subsidence, emphasizing the need for further measurement, which could be done with Sentinel-1 and NASA's upcoming NISAR mission.

Impact of a cometary outburst on its ionosphere Rosetta Plasma Consortium observations of the outburst exhibited by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 19 February 2016	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						plasmas; waves; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; comets: general; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	LOW-FREQUENCY WAVES; SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS; ELECTRON SENSOR; SOLAR-WIND; ION; RPC; INSTRUMENT; MODEL; 17P/HOLMES; MECHANISM	We present a detailed study of the cometary ionospheric response to a cometary brightness outburst using in situ measurements for the first time. The comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) at a heliocentric distance of 2.4 AU from the Sun, exhibited an outburst at similar to 1000 UT on 19 February 2016, characterized by an increase in the coma surface brightness of two orders of magnitude. The Rosetta spacecraft monitored the plasma environment of 67P from a distance of 30 km, orbiting with a relative speed of similar to 0.2 m s(-1). The onset of the outburst was preceded by pre-outburst decreases in neutral gas density at Rosetta, in local plasma density, and in negative spacecraft potential at similar to 0950 UT. In response to the outburst, the neutral density increased by a factor of similar to 1.8 and the local plasma density increased by a factor of similar to 3, driving the spacecraft potential more negative. The energetic electrons (tens of eV) exhibited decreases in the flux of factors of similar to 2 to 9, depending on the energy of the electrons. The local magnetic field exhibited a slight increase in amplitude (similar to 5 nT) and an abrupt rotation (similar to 36.4 degrees) in response to the outburst. A weakening of 10-100 mHz magnetic field fluctuations was also noted during the outburst, suggesting alteration of the origin of the wave activity by the outburst. The plasma and magnetic field effects lasted for about 4 h, from similar to 1000 UT to 1400 UT. The plasma densities are compared with an ionospheric model. This shows that while photoionization is the main source of electrons, electron-impact ionization and a reduction in the ion outflow velocity need to be accounted for in order to explain the plasma density enhancement near the outburst peak.

This study involves the analysis of 16 years of lidar observations recorded at Reunion (20.8 degrees S, 55.5 degrees E) and 21 years of lidar observations recorded at Mauna Loa (19.5 degrees N, 155.6 degrees W) together with SABER observations at these two locations. MILs appear in 10 and 9.3% of the observed temperature profiles recorded by Rayleigh lidar at Reunion and Mauna Loa, respectively. The parameters defining MILs show a semi-annual cycle over the two selected sites with maxima occurring near the equinoxes and minima occurring during the solstices. Over both sites, the maximum mean amplitude is observed in April and October, and this corresponds to a value greater than 35 K. According to lidar observations, the maximum and minimum mean of the base height ranged from 79 to 80.5 km and from 76 to 77.5 km, respectively. The MILs at Reunion appear on average similar to 1 km thinner and similar to 1 km lower, with an amplitude of similar to 2K higher than Mauna Loa. Generally, the statistical results for these two tropical locations as presented in this investigation are in fairly good agreement with previous studies. When compared to lidar measurements, on average SABER observations show MILs with greater amplitude, thickness and base altitudes of 4 K, 0.75 and 1.1 km, respectively. Taking into account the temperature error by SABER in the mesosphere, it can therefore be concluded that the measurements obtained from lidar and SABER observations are in significant agreement. The frequency spectrum analysis based on the lidar profiles and the 60-day averaged profile from SABER confirms the presence of the semi-annual oscillation where the magnitude maximum is found to coincide with the height range of the temperature inversion zone. This connection between increases in the semi-annual component close to the inversion zone is in agreement with most previously reported studies over tropics based on satellite observations. Results presented in this study confirm through the use of the ground-based Rayleigh lidar at Reunion and Mauna Loa that the semi-annual oscillation contributes to the formation of MILs over the tropical region.

Less than two seconds after the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region of the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the gravitational-wave source(4-6). This sky region was subsequently observed by optical astronomy facilities(7), resulting in the identification(8-13) of an optical transient signal within about ten arcseconds of the galaxy NGC 4993. This detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves represents the first 'multi-messenger' astronomical observation. Such observations enable GW170817 to be used as a 'standard siren'(14-18) (meaning that the absolute distance to the source can be determined directly from the gravitational-wave measurements) to measure the Hubble constant. This quantity represents the local expansion rate of the Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental importance to cosmology. Here we report a measurement of the Hubble constant that combines the distance to the source inferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity inferred from measurements of the redshift using the electromagnetic data. In contrast to previous measurements, ours does not require the use of a cosmic 'distance ladder'(19): the gravitational-wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out to cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical distance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be about 70 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This value is consistent with existing measurements(20,21), while being completely independent of them. Additional standard siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will enable the Hubble constant to be constrained to high precision.	[Abbott, B. P.; Abbott, R.; Adhikari, R.

Accurate and Robust Scene Reconstruction in the Presence of Misassociated Features for Aerial Sensing	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							IMAGE; INFRASTRUCTURE	Georeferencing through aerial imagery has several applications, including remote sensing, real-time situational mission awareness, environmental monitoring, rescue and relief, map generation, autonomous hazard avoidance, and landing and navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In aerial imagery, structure from motion (SfM) is often used for three-dimensional (3D) point reconstruction (i.e., ground locations) and for camera pose estimation (i.e., airborne position and orientation) from a set of geometrically matched features between two-dimensional (2D) images. In order to improve the correspondence estimation, outliers (defined as gross misassociated features) are determined and excluded using an outlier rejection algorithm such as random sample consensus (RANSAC); however, in practice, it is impossible to ensure that outlier rejection algorithms always lead to perfect feature correspondences. Consequently, there remain misassociations between matched features in different views that significantly lower the accuracy and robustness of 3D scene reconstruction algorithms. This paper introduces an adaptive resection-intersection bundle adjustment approach that refines the 3D points and camera poses separately after the gross misassociations are removed by an outlier rejection algorithm. For each iteration, the proposed approach identifies the potential misassociated features independently in the resection as well as the intersection stage, where these potential outliers, contrary to previous studies, are reexamined at later iterations. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach leads to smaller 3D reconstruction errors by rejecting almost all of the misassociations as outliers while the maximum number of inlier matched features are retained. The results from several numerical simulations and real data sets are presented, and it is shown that the proposed approach outperforms existing bundle adjustment (BA) approaches in the presence of misassociated features although the convergence rate is slower.

The sequence was initiated with two major (M(w)6.0) foreshocks, and the mainshock (M-w) occurred 25h after the second major foreshock. We combine GPS, strong motion, synthetic aperture radar images, and surface offset data in a joint inversion to resolve the kinematic rupture process of the mainshock and coseismic displacement of the foreshocks. The joint inversion results reveal a unilateral rupture process for the mainshock involving sequential rupture of four major asperities. The slip area of the foreshocks and mainshock and the aftershock loci form a detailed complementary pattern. The mainshock rupture terminates near the rim of the caldera, leaving a similar to 10km long gap of aftershocks. This area is characterized by high temperature and low shear wave velocity, density, and resistivity, which may be related to the partially melted geothermal condition. Ductile material property near the volcano may act as a material barrier to the dynamic rupture. Topographic weight of the caldera increases compressional normal stress on the fault plane, which may behave as a stress barrier. Long-term seismic hazard and deformation behaviors related to these two types of barriers are discussed in terms of the associated frictional mechanism. Significant postseismic creeps observed near the volcano area indicates a velocity strengthening frictional behavior near the rupture termination, which confirms that the material barrier mechanism is likely the dominant rupture termination mechanism.

A Statistical Graphical Model of the California Reservoir System	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						water resources; sustainability; graphical models; latent variables; convex optimization	COVARIANCE ESTIMATION; WATER-LEVEL; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; STREAMFLOW; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; DROUGHT	The recent California drought has highlighted the potential vulnerability of the state's water management infrastructure to multiyear dry intervals. Due to the high complexity of the network, dynamic storage changes in California reservoirs on a state-wide scale have previously been difficult to model using either traditional statistical or physical approaches. Indeed, although there is a significant line of research on exploring models for single (or a small number of) reservoirs, these approaches are not amenable to a system-wide modeling of the California reservoir network due to the spatial and hydrological heterogeneities of the system. In this work, we develop a state-wide statistical graphical model to characterize the dependencies among a collection of 55 major California reservoirs across the state; this model is defined with respect to a graph in which the nodes index reservoirs and the edges specify the relationships or dependencies between reservoirs. We obtain and validate this model in a data-driven manner based on reservoir volumes over the period 2003-2016. A key feature of our framework is a quantification of the effects of external phenomena that influence the entire reservoir network. We further characterize the degree to which physical factors (e.g., state-wide Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), average temperature, snow pack) and economic factors (e.g., consumer price index, number of agricultural workers) explain these external influences. As a consequence of this analysis, we obtain a system-wide health diagnosis of the reservoir network as a function of PDSI.

First Detection of Two Near-Earth Asteroids With a Southern Hemisphere Planetary Radar System	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article						planetary radar; asteroid; Tidbinbilla; Southern Hemisphere; radar	LUNAR POLES; ICE; CRATERS	We describe the first demonstration of a Southern Hemisphere planetary radar system to detect two near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). The demonstration was conducted in a bistatic manner, with the 70m antenna of the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex transmitting at2.1GHz and reception at the Parkes Radio Telescope, outfitted with multiple receivers, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. This initial system was used to detect the NEAs (43577) 2005UL5 and(33342) 1998WT24 during their close approaches in2015 November and2015 December, respectively. We describe the performance of the system and consider future possibilities using other antennas of the Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex as transmitters. Plain Language Summary Planetary radar uses large radio dishes to transmit and receive radar signals off distant objects in the solar system. Careful processing of these signals over periods of several hours allows researchers to very accurately determine orbits, measure rotation rates, and in some cases to map surface features. In the past all of these activities have been performed with assets in the Northern Hemisphere. This paper details the first use of a Southern Hemisphere network for this task. The 70m dish at the NASA/JPL/CSIRO complex at Tidbinbilla in Canberra, Australia, was used as the transmitter, and the Parkes and Narrabri radio telescopes were used as receivers to successfully detect and track asteroids. A Southern Hemisphere network allows asteroids approaching from the south to be observed, filling in a blind spot in our existing capabilities.

In this study, we investigate Kelvin waves (KWs) during the Hai-Tang typhoon of 2005 using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) of regional precipitation, zonal and meridional winds. For the analysis, we use daily precipitation datasets from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and wind datasets from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-analysis (ERA-Interim). As an additional measurement, we use in-situ precipitation datasets from rain-gauges over the Taiwan region. The maximum accumulated precipitation was approximately 2400 mm during the period July 17-21, 2005 over the southwestern region of Taiwan. The spectral analysis using the wind speed at 950 hPa found in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) reveals prevailing Kelvin wave periods of similar to 3 days,similar to 4-6 days, and similar to 6-10 days, respectively. From our analysis of precipitation datasets, we found the Kelvin waves oscillated with periods between similar to 8 and 20 days.

However, errors in a given model in the high-frequency domain, primarily due to unresolved gravity features, can result in errors in the estimated along-track freeboard. These errors are exacerbated in areas with a sparse lead distribution in consolidated ice pack conditions. Additionally model errors can impact ocean geostrophic currents, derived from satellite altimeter data, while remaining biases in these models may impact longer-term, multisensor oceanographic time series of sea level change in the Arctic. This study focuses on an assessment of five state-of-the-art Arctic MSS models (UCL13/04 and DTU15/13/10) and a commonly used GGM (EGM2008). We describe errors due to unresolved gravity features, intersatellite biases, and remaining satellite orbit errors, and their impact on the derivation of sea ice freeboard. The latest MSS models, incorporating CryoSat-2 sea surface height measurements, show improved definition of gravity features, such as the Gakkel Ridge. The standard deviation between models ranges 0.03-0.25 m. The impact of remaining MSS/GGM errors on freeboard retrieval can reach several decimeters in parts of the Arctic. While the maximum observed freeboard difference found in the central Arctic was 0.59 m (UCL13 MSS minus EGM2008 GGM), the standard deviation in freeboard differences is 0.03-0.06 m.

Interannual Variation in Offshore Advection of Amazon-Orinoco Plume Waters: Observations, Forcing Mechanisms, and Impacts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Amazon-Orinoco plume; sea surface salinity; advection; Lagrangian; sea surface temperature	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RIVER PLUME; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; SALINITY; CURRENTS; MATTER; SPACE; LAYER; RINGS	This study investigates sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the tropical Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles, a region where freshwater advection from the Amazon and Orinoco Rivers, may potentially impact air-sea interaction. Observations are used to document later-summer variability and evaluate offshore riverine transport from 2010 to 2014. During this period, the largest difference in plume-affected areas, defined as the extent covered by SSS lower than 35.5 pss, is found between 2011 and 2014. Plume waters covered 92% of the study region in 2011 and 60% in 2014, with the average SSS in the study region being 2 pss lower in 2011. Lagrangian particle tracking based on satellite-derived ocean currents is used to diagnose the impact of the river plumes on SSS and SST from 2010 to 2014. Northward freshwater flux in summer 2014 was significantly weaker than fluxes in 2010-2013. This difference is not due to interannual discharge variability, but to significant changes in eddy-driven transport and cross-shore winds. In particular, the stronger cross-shore wind in May 2014 restricted offshore freshwater flow and lead to a smaller plume-affected area. Persistent SST gradients are often found near the plume edge, which may have implications for ocean-atmosphere coupling associated with atmospheric convection. SST in the study region was 1 degrees C higher in 2010 compared to other years, and is related to basin-scale ocean-atmosphere processes. Interannual variation in Amazon advective pathways and the associated SSS changes are also influenced by changes in the ITCZ position between 2011 and 2014.	[Fournier, S.; Lee, T.; Gierach, M.

The Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction instrument on Curiosity performed quantitative mineralogical analyses of the <150m size fraction of the Namib dune at a location called Gobabeb. Gobabeb is dominated by basaltic minerals. Plagioclase, Fo56 olivine, and two Ca-Mg-Fe pyroxenes account for the majority of crystalline phases along with minor magnetite, quartz, hematite, and anhydrite. In addition to the crystalline phases, a minimum similar to 42wt % of the Gobabeb sample is X-ray amorphous. Mineralogical analysis of the Gobabeb data set provides insights into the origin(s) and geologic history of the dune material and offers an important opportunity for ground truth of orbital observations. CheMin's analysis of the mineralogy and phase chemistry of modern and ancient Gale crater dune fields, together with other measurements by Curiosity's science payload, provides new insights into present and past eolian processes on Mars.

Quantifying Microorganisms at Low Concentrations Using Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM)	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Bioengineering; Issue 129; Volumetric microscopy; holographic microscopy; Mach-Zehnder; interferometric microscopy; bacterial enumeration; label-free imaging; astrobiology; life detection	SYBR GREEN I; EPIFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MEMBRANE FILTERS; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; TOTAL BACTERIA; GRAM STAIN; ENUMERATION; WATER; IDENTIFICATION	Accurately detecting and counting sparse bacterial samples has many applications in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical processing industries, in medical diagnostics, and for life detection by robotic missions to other planets and moons of the solar system. Currently, sparse bacterial samples are counted by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times (days to weeks), and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample. Here, we demonstrate how to use off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) to enumerate bacteria in very dilute cultures (100-10(4) cells/mL). First, the construction of the custom DHM is discussed, along with detailed instructions on building a low-cost instrument. The principles of holography are discussed, and a statistical model is used to estimate how long videos should be to detect cells, based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument and the concentration of the bacterial solution (Table 2). Video detection of cells at 10(5), 10(4), 10(3), and 100 cells/mL is demonstrated in real time using unreconstructed holograms. Reconstruction of amplitude and phase images is demonstrated using an open-source software package.

The focus lies on the EOP (Earth Orientation Parameter) determination based on the Continuous VLBI Campaign 2014 (CONT14) data, but also earlier CONT campaigns are analyzed. For validation and comparison purposes we use EOP determined with the classical LSM (least squares method) estimated from the same VLBI data set as the Kalman solution with a daily resolution. To gain higher resolved EOP from LSM we run solutions which yield hourly estimates for polar motion and dUT1 = Universal Time (UT1) - Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). As an external validation data set we use a GPS (Global Positioning System) solution providing hourly polar motion results. Further, we describe our approach for determining the noise driving the Kalman filter. It has to be chosen carefully, since it can lead to a significant degradation of the results. We illustrate this issue in context with the de-correlation of polar motion and nutation. Finally, we find that the agreement with respect to GPS can be improved by up to 50% using our filter compared to the LSM approach, reaching a similar precision than the GPS solution. Especially the power of erroneous high-frequency signals can be reduced dramatically, opening up new possibilities for high-frequency EOP studies and investigations of the models involved in VLBI data analysis. We prove that the Kalman filter is more than on par with the classical least squares method and that it is a valuable alternative, especially on the advent of the VLBI2010 Global Observing System and within the GGOS frame work.

Increased vapor variance is associated with decreased high cloud fraction and an enhancement of low-level radiative cooling in dry regions of the domain. The result is found across a range of sea surface temperatures and rain rates. This suggests the possibility of an enhanced low-level circulation feeding the moist convecting areas when vapor variance is large. These findings are consistent with idealized models of self-aggregation, in which the aggregation of convection is maintained by a combination of low-level radiative cooling in dry regions and mid-to-upper-level radiative warming in cloudy regions.

Emerging Technologies and Synergies for Airborne and Space-Based Measurements of Water Vapor Profiles	SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						Remote sensing; Water vapor profiles; Atmospheric science; Lidar; Differential absorption lidar; Radar; Differential absorption radar; Microwave occultation; Hyperspectral microwave; Emerging technology	EMITTED RADIANCE INTERFEROMETER; LIDAR MEASUREMENTS; UPPER-TROPOSPHERE; THERMODYNAMIC PROFILES; RADIO OCCULTATION; ATMOSPHERIC WATER; DELTA-D; CLOUD; PERFORMANCE; TEMPERATURE	A deeper understanding of how clouds will respond to a warming climate is one of the outstanding challenges in climate science. Uncertainties in the response of clouds, and particularly shallow clouds, have been identified as the dominant source of the discrepancy in model estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity. As the community gains a deeper understanding of the many processes involved, there is a growing appreciation of the critical role played by fluctuations in water vapor and the coupling of water vapor and atmospheric circulations. Reduction of uncertainties in cloud-climate feedbacks and convection initiation as well as improved understanding of processes governing these effects will result from profiling of water vapor in the lower troposphere with improved accuracy and vertical resolution compared to existing airborne and space-based measurements. This paper highlights new technologies and improved measurement approaches for measuring lower tropospheric water vapor and their expected added value to current observations. Those include differential absorption lidar and radar, microwave occultation between low-Earth orbiters, and hyperspectral microwave remote sensing. Each methodology is briefly explained, and measurement capabilities as well as the current technological readiness for aircraft and satellite implementation are specified. Potential synergies between the technologies are discussed, actual examples hereof are given, and future perspectives are explored. Based on technical maturity and the foreseen near-mid-term development path of the various discussed measurement approaches, we find that improved measurements of water vapor throughout the troposphere would greatly benefit from the combination of differential absorption lidar focusing on the lower troposphere with passive remote sensors constraining the upper-tropospheric humidity.

J	Behrangi, A; Wen, YX				Behrangi, Ali; Wen, Yixin			On the Spatial and Temporal Sampling Errors of Remotely Sensed Precipitation Products	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						precipitation; remote sensing; spatial error; temporal error		Observation with coarse spatial and temporal sampling can cause large errors in quantification of the amount, intensity, and duration of precipitation events. In this study, the errors resulting from temporal and spatial sampling of precipitation events were quantified and examined using the latest version (V4) of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission integrated multi-satellite retrievals for GPM (IMERG), which is available since spring of 2014. Relative mean square error was calculated at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees every 0.5 h between the degraded (temporally and spatially) and original IMERG products. The temporal and spatial degradation was performed by producing three-hour (T3), six-hour (T6), 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees (S5), and 1.0 degrees x 1.0 degrees (S10) maps. The results show generally larger errors over land than ocean, especially over mountainous regions. The relative error of T6 is almost 20% larger than T3 over tropical land, but is smaller in higher latitudes. Over land relative error of T6 is larger than S5 across all latitudes, while T6 has larger relative error than S10 poleward of 20 degrees S-20 degrees N. Similarly, the relative error of T3 exceeds S5 poleward of 20 degrees S-20 degrees N, but does not exceed S10, except in very high latitudes. Similar results are also seen over ocean, but the error ratios are generally less sensitive to seasonal changes. The results also show that the spatial and temporal relative errors are not highly correlated. Overall, lower correlations between the spatial and temporal relative errors are observed over ocean than over land. Quantification of such spatiotemporal effects provides additional insights into evaluation studies, especially when different products are cross-compared at a range of spatiotemporal scales.

The Cross-Calibration of Spectral Radiances and Cross-Validation of CO2 Estimates from GOSAT and OCO-2	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						greenhouse gas remote sensing; satellite validation and calibration; inter-comparison; carbon dioxide; GOSAT; OCO-2	RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; TANSO-FTS; CARBON; SPECTROMETER; PERFORMANCE; INSTRUMENT; SCIAMACHY; SATELLITE	The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) launched in January 2009 has provided radiance spectra with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer for more than eight years. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) launched in July 2014, collects radiance spectra using an imaging grating spectrometer. Both sensors observe sunlight reflected from Earth's surface and retrieve atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, but use different spectrometer technologies, observing geometries, and ground track repeat cycles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing for CO2 monitoring, the GOSAT and OCO-2 teams have worked together pre- and post-launch to cross-calibrate the instruments and cross-validate their retrieval algorithms and products. In this work, we first compare observed radiance spectra within three narrow bands centered at 0.76, 1.60 and 2.06 mu m, at temporally coincident and spatially collocated points from September 2014 to March 2017. We reconciled the differences in observation footprints size, viewing geometry and associated differences in surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). We conclude that the spectral radiances measured by the two instruments agree within 5% for all bands. Second, we estimated mean bias and standard deviation of column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) retrieved from GOSAT and OCO-2 from September 2014 to May 2016. GOSAT retrievals used Build 7.3 (V7.3) of the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) algorithm while OCO-2 retrievals used Version 7 of the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm. The mean biases and standard deviations are -0.57 +/- 3.33 ppm over land with high gain, -0.17 +/- 1.48 ppm over ocean with high gain and -0.19 +/- 2.79 ppm over land with medium gain. Finally, our study is complemented with an analysis of error sources: retrieved surface pressure (P-surf), aerosol optical depth (AOD), BRDF and surface albedo inhomogeneity. We found no change in XCO2 bias or standard deviation with time, demonstrating that both instruments are well calibrated.

On the other hand, the images obtained using infrared/visible sensors are often of higher resolution. In this paper, we develop a data fusion methodology and apply it to enhance the resolution of a microwave image using the data from a collocated infrared/visible sensor. Such an approach takes advantage of the spatial resolution of the infrared instrument and the sensing accuracy of the microwave instrument. The model leverages sparsity in signals and is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing. We tested our method using a precipitation scene captured with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-B) microwave instrument and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared instrument and compared the results to simultaneous radar observations. We show that the data fusion product is better than the original AMSU-B and AVHRR observations across all statistical indicators.

The microfluidic instrument is composed of three major components. These include a mixing chamber where the soil sample is mixed and agitated with the solvent (water), a subcritical water extraction chamber where the sample is sealed with a freeze valve at the chip inlet after a vapor bubble is injected into the inlet channels to ensure the pressure in the chip is in equilibrium with the vapor pressure and the slurry is then heated to <= 200 degrees C in the SCWE chamber, and a filter or settling chamber where the slurry is pumped to after extraction. The extraction yield of the microfluidic SCWE chip process ranged from 50% compared to acid hydrolysis and 80%-100% compared to a benchtop microwave SCWE for low biomass samples.

The NuSTAR Extragalactic Survey: Average Broadband X-Ray Spectral Properties of the NuSTAR-detected AGNs	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; quasars: general; surveys; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; DEEP FIELD-SOUTH; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; STAR-FORMATION; SKY SURVEY; CHANDRA; SAMPLE; EVOLUTION; REFLECTION; CONSTRAINTS	We present a study of the average X-ray spectral properties of the sources detected by the NuSTAR extragalactic survey, comprising observations of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDFS), Extended Groth Strip (EGS), and the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). The sample includes 182 NuSTAR sources (64 detected at 8-24 keV), with 3-24 keV fluxes ranging between f3(-24keV) approximate to 10(-14) and 6 x 10(-13) erg cm(-2) S-1 (f(8-24 keV) approximate to 3 x 10(-14)-3 x 10(-13) erg cm(-2) S-1) and redshifts in the range of z = 0.04-3.21. We produce composite spectra from the Chandra + NuSTAR data (E approximate to 2-40 keV, rest frame) for all the sources with redshift identifications (95%) and investigate the intrinsic, average spectra of the sources, divided into broad-line (BL) and narrow-line (NL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and also in different bins of X-ray column density and luminosity. The average power-law photon index for the whole sample is Gamma = 1.651(-0.03)(+0.03), flatter than the Gamma approximate to 1.8 typically found for AGNs. While the spectral slope of BL and X-ray unabsorbed AGNs is consistent with the typical values (Gamma = 1.79(-0.01)(+0.01)), a significant flattening is seen in NL AGNs and heavily absorbed sources (Gamma = 1.60(-0.05)(+0.08) and Gamma = 1.38(-0.12)(+0.12), respectively), likely due to the effect of absorption and to the contribution from the Compton reflection component to the high-energy flux (E > 10 keV). We find that the typical reflection fraction in our spectra is R approximate to 0.5 (for F = 1.8), with a tentative indication of an increase of the reflection strength with X-ray column density. While there is no significant evidence for a dependence of the photon index on X-ray luminosity in our sample, we find that R decreases with luminosity, with relatively high levels of reflection (R approximate to 1.2) for L10-40 keV < 10(44) erg s(-1) and R approximate to 0.3 for L10-40 (keV) > 10(44) erg s(-1) AGNs, assuming a fixed spectral slope of Gamma = 1.8.

We describe the Virgo Redux program, which provides high-resolution UV and NIR imaging. Combining this data with optical and NIR imaging from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey, we estimate masses, metallicities, and ages using simple stellar population (SSP) models. For 19 nuclei, we compare to SSP parameters derived from Keck and Gemini spectra and find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic metallicity: the rms scatter is 0.3. dex. We reproduce the nucleus-galaxy mass fraction of 0.33(-0.07)(+0.09)% for galaxy stellar masses 10(8.4)-10(10.3) M-circle dot with a typical precision of similar to 35% for the nuclei masses. Based on available model predictions, there is no single preferred formation scenario for nuclei, suggesting that nuclei are formed stochastically through a mix of processes. Nuclei metallicities are statistically identical to those of their hosts, appearing 0.07 +/- 0.3 dex more metal-rich on average; however, omitting galaxies with unusual origins, nuclei are 0.20 +/- 0.28 dex more metal-rich. Nuclei appear to be 0.56 +/- 0.12 dex more metal-rich than ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) at fixed mass. We find no clear age difference between nuclei and their galaxies, with nuclei displaying a broad range of ages. Interestingly, we find that the most massive nuclei may be flatter and more closely aligned with the semimajor axes of their hosts, suggesting that they formed through predominantly dissipative processes.

While the coarse resolution is satisfactory to many applications, there are also a lot of applications which would benefit from a higher resolution SM product. The SMAP radiometer-based SM product was downscaled to 1 km using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and validated against airborne data from the Passive Active L-band System instrument. The downscaling approach uses MODIS land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index to construct soil evaporative efficiency, which is used to downscale the SMAP SM. The algorithm was applied to one SMAP pixel during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2015 (SMAPVEX15) in a semiarid study area for validation of the approach. SMAPVEX15 offers a unique data set for testing SM downscaling algorithms. The results indicated reasonable skill (root-mean-square difference of 0.053 m(3)/m(3) for 1-km resolution and 0.037 m(3)/m(3) for 3-km resolution) in resolving high-resolution SM features within the coarse-scale pixel. The success benefits from the fact that the surface temperature in this region is controlled by soil evaporation, the topographical variation within the chosen pixel area is relatively moderate, and the vegetation density is relatively low over most parts of the pixel. The analysis showed that the combination of the SMAP and MODIS data under these conditions can result in a high-resolution SM product with an accuracy suitable for many applications.

Microwave Signatures of Snow Cover Using Numerical Maxwell Equations Based on Discrete Dipole Approximation in Bicontinuous Media and Half-Space Dyadic Green's Function	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Active and passive microwave; backscattering enhancement; coherent layer effects; dense media radiative transfer (DMRT); dense media scattering; discrete dipole approximation (DDA); full wave simulation; half-space Green's function; snow remote sensing; volume integral equation (VIE)	BACKSCATTERING ENHANCEMENT; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; EMISSION MODEL; ALGORITHM; SURFACES; BAND	A three-dimensional snowpack scattering and emission model is developed by numerically solving Maxwell's equations (NMM3D) over the entire snowpack on an underlying half-space. The solutions are crucial to microwave remote sensing that requires the preservation of coherent phase information. The heterogeneous snowpack is represented as a bicontinuous medium. Effects of the underlying half-space are included through a half-space Green's function in a volume integral equation formulation. The volume integral equation is then solved using the discrete dipole approximation. The fast Fourier transform is effectuated for all three dimensions with half-space Green's function rather than the conventional free space Green's function. To overcome the snow volume truncation in the finite numerical calculations, periodic boundary conditions are applied in the lateral extent. Thus, in NMM3D, the physical microwave scattering and emission problem is solved without using any radiative transfer equations. In this formulation, the scattering matrix of the snowpack accounts for both the magnitude and phase. The NMM3D simulations are demonstrated at Ku-band frequency for a snow cover up to 25-cm thick. The results are applicable to remote sensing of snow over sea ice, and thin layers of terrestrial snow. Quantitative values of backscattering and bistatic scattering coefficients are derived for active microwave remote sensing, and brightness temperatures for passive microwave remote sensing. The full wave simulation results are compared with those of the partially coherent approach of the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT). The NMM3D results capture effects of backscattering enhancement and coherent layering that are missed in DMRT. The full wave solution to Maxwell equations is important to advance radar polarimetry, interferometry, and tomography that require the preservation of the full phase information and all interface interactions for applications to radar remote sensing of snow cover on land and on sea ice.

J	Kim, SB; Arii, M; Jackson, T				Kim, Seung-bum; Arii, Motofumi; Jackson, Thomas			Modeling L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data Through Dielectric Changes in Soil Moisture and Vegetation Over Shrublands	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Radar scattering model; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)	SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; SAR DATA; RETRIEVAL; BACKSCATTERING; SCATTERING; AREAS	L-band airborne synthetic aperture radar observations were made over California shrublands to better understand the effects of soil and vegetation parameters on backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)). Temporal changes in sigma(0) of up to 3 dB were highly correlated to surface soil moisture but not to vegetation, even though vegetation water content (VWC) varied seasonally by a factor of two. HH was always greater than VV, suggesting the importance of double-bounce scattering by the woody parts. However, the geometric and dielectric properties of the woody parts did not vary significantly over time. Instead the changes in VWC occurred primarily in thin leaves that may not meaningfully influence absorption and scattering. A physically based model for single scattering by discrete elements of plants successfully simulated the magnitude of the temporal variations in HH, VV, and HH/VV with a difference of less than 0.9 dB for both the mean and standard deviation when compared with the airborne data. In order to simulate the observations, the VWC input of the plant to the model was formulated as a function of plant's dielectric property (water fraction) while the plant geometry remains static in time. In comparison, when the VWC input was characterized by the geometry of a growing plant, the model performed poorly in describing the observed patterns in the sigma(0) changes. The modeling results offer explanation of the observation that soil moisture correlated highly with sigma(0) : the dominant mechanisms for HH and VV are double-bounce scattering by trunk, and soil surface scattering, respectively. The time-series inversion of the physical model was able to retrieve soil moisture with the difference of -0.037 m(3)/m(3) (mean), 0.025 m(3)/m(3) (standard deviation), and 0.89 (correlation), which demonstrates the efficacy of the model-based time-series soil moisture retrieval for shrublands.

Because surface radar reflection prevents hydrometeor detection below similar to 720 m, the CloudSat 2C-RAIN-PROFILE retrieval uses an evaporation-sedimentation model to extend its profile estimates to the surface. We use in situ radar measurements from the ship-based Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) campaign in the Northeastern subtropical Pacific, which sampled a diverse set of shallow marine cloud regimes, to evaluate the evaporation-sedimentation model near the surface. We suggest an empirical bias correction, which can be applied to the 2C-RAIN-PROFILE retrieval. Before this correction, the evaporation-sedimentation model produced a mean surface rain rate bias along the MAGIC transect of 57%; after correction, this bias was effectively eliminated. We also present the evidence of the validity of this bias correction across regimes in the MAGIC region, and also in the southeast subtropical Pacific, where the magnitude of the mean bias for surface rain due to the evaporation-sedimentation model is reduced by a factor of 4.

Models of the Jovian-trapped radiation environment are a prerequisite for planning missions to this extreme environment. The high energy (>0.1 MeV for electrons and >1 MeV/nuc for protons and heavier ions) particle environment drives the shielding and microelectronic parts design for a spacecraft. Recently, models based on the measurements by the Galileo energetic particle detector and heavy ion counter have been updated for the trapped protons and heavy ions. The purpose of this paper is to describe these changes to the proton and heavy ion models and demonstrate their application to and relative impact on mission design. While trapped electrons at Jupiter dominate for total ionizing dose and displacement damage dose for typically shielded parts/materials (e.g., with similar to 100 mil or 2.54 mm of aluminum shielding), trapped protons can be a significant contributor to lightly shielded components (e.g., solar cells under 10-20 mil of cover glass). In contrast, although they will be described here for completeness, the Jovian-trapped heavy ions are typically not a driving environmental consideration for single event effects evaluations (their energies are so low that a small amount of shielding will attenuate the fluxes to levels below the interplanetary solar energetic particle and galactic cosmic rays).

Direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to hidden nutrient loads along the Great Lakes coast of the United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Water quality; Nutrients; Water budget; Seepage meter; Direct groundwater discharge; Great Lakes	HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CLOSED-BASIN LAKE; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SEEPAGE; PHOSPHORUS; WATER; ERIE; NITRATE; RIVER; ZONE	Direct groundwater discharge delivers nutrients from land and lakebed sediments to the Great Lakes, which impacts lake water quality. Broad spatial distributions of discharging groundwater are often difficult to measure directly. We present high resolution estimates of direct groundwater discharge across 43% of the Great Lakes coastline based on a water budget approach that uses hydroclimatic models and high-resolution hydrographic data available within the United States. We also integrate land use data to identify coastal areas vulnerable to high groundwater-borne nutrient loads. Estimated rates of direct groundwater discharge along the Great Lakes coast are highly variable, but generally are greatest for Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Almost one-third of Lake Erie's United States coastline is vulnerable to groundwater sources of nutrients. To assess uncertainties and limitations in our vulnerability analysis, a vulnerable site along Lake Erie was selected for detailed field measurements of direct groundwater discharge rates and nutrient fluxes. Measured discharge rates were significantly lower than water budget-based estimates (354 +/- 25 m(3) y(-1) m(-1) compared to 588 +/- 181 m(3) y(-1) m(-1)). Dissolved phosphorous concentrations in the lakebed were elevated compared to onshore groundwater, while nitrate concentrations were lower, indicative of a highly reactive sediment-water interface. Some of the measured phosphorus may be locally sourced from desorption of legacy P or mineralization of organic matter in the lakebed, which our vulnerability framework does not include. Much of the land-derived nitrogen may be transformed along groundwater flow paths prior to discharge. While model-based estimates of direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to nutrient loading are important for managing Great Lakes water quality, direct field observations remain essential for quantifying fluxes.

J	Alpers, W; Holt, B; Zeng, K				Alpers, Werner; Holt, Benjamin; Zeng, Kan			Oil spill detection by imaging radars: Challenges and pitfalls	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Oil spills; Biogenic slicks; SAR; Polarimetry; Co-polarized phase difference	SEA-SURFACE; POLARIMETRIC SAR; PHASE DIFFERENCE; CROSS-SECTION; SATELLITE; OCEAN; SLICKS; MODEL; PLUMES; MULTIFREQUENCY	Criteria for discriminating between radar signatures of oil films and biogenic slicks visible on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface as dark patches are critically reviewed. We question the often claimed high success rate of oil spill detection algorithms using single-polarization SARs because the SAR images used to train these algorithms are based usually on subjective interpretation and are not validated by on-site inspections or multi-sensor measurements carried out from oil pollution surveillance planes. Furthermore, we doubt that polarimetric parameters derived from fully-polarimetric SAR data, like entropy, anisotropy, and mean scattering angle, are beneficial for discriminating between mineral oil films and biogenic slicks. We challenge the often made claim that another scattering mechanism than Bragg scattering applies for radar backscattering from mineral oil films than from biogenic slicks. This view is supported by data acquired by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) of NASA/JPL, which operates at L-band and has an extremely low noise floor. We suspect that opposing results obtained from previous analyses of spacebome polarimetric SAR data are caused by the high noise floors of the spacebome SARs. However, most of the analyzed spacebome polarimetric data were not acquired at L-band, but at C-and X-band. On the other hand, differences in the statistical behavior of the radar backscattering could be real due to the fact that, other than biogenic surface films, mineral oil films, can form multi-layers, whose thickness can vary within an oil patch. Radar back scattering from emulsion layers can also fluctuate due to variations of the oil/water mixture ratio. These effects could cause an increase of the standard deviation (STD) of the co-polarized phase difference (CPD) for scattering at mineral oil films and emulsions. In the special case of thick oil layers or oil/water emulsion layers, where the radar is sensitive to the dielectric constant of the oil, discrimination becomes possible due the fact that Bragg scattering depends on the dielectric constant of the scattering medium.

The independent pulsations of Jupiter's northern and southern X-ray auroras	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SOLAR-WIND; MAGNETOSPHERE; WAVES; FLUX	Auroral hot spots are observed across the Universe at different scales' and mark the coupling between a surrounding plasma environment and an atmosphere. Within our own Solar System, Jupiter possesses the only resolvable example of this large-scale energy transfer. Jupiter's northern X-ray aurora is concentrated into a hot spot, which is located at the most poleward regions of the planet's aurora and pulses either periodically(2,3) or irregularly(4,4). X-ray emission line spectra demonstrate that Jupiter's northern hot spot is produced by high charge-state oxygen, sulfur and/or carbon ions with an energy of tens of MeV (refs (4-6)) that are undergoing charge exchange. Observations instead failed to reveal a similar feature in the south(2,3,4,4). Here, we report the existence of a persistent southern X-ray hot spot. Surprisingly, this largescale southern auroral structure behaves independently of its northern counterpart. Using XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray campaigns, performed in May-June 2016 and March 2007, we show that Jupiter's northern and southern spots each exhibit different characteristics, such as different periodic pulsations and uncorrelated changes in brightness. These observations imply that highly energetic, non-conjugate magnetospheric processes sometimes drive the polar regions of Jupiter's day side magnetosphere. This is in contrast to current models of X-ray generation for Jupiter(4,10). Understanding the behaviour and drivers of Jupiter's pair of hot spots is critical to the use of X-rays as diagnostics of the wide range of rapidly rotating celestial bodies that exhibit these auroral phenomena.

Earth's quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) (observed in the lower stratospheric winds with an average period of 28 months) is one of the most regular, repeatable cycles exhibited by our climate system(1,5,6), and yet recent work has shown that this regularity can be disrupted by events occurring far away from the equatorial region, an example of a phenomenon known as atmospheric teleconnection2,2. Here, we reveal that Saturn's equatorial quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) (with an-15-year period(3,9)) can also be dramatically perturbed. An intense springtime storm erupted at Saturn's northern mid-latitudes in December 2010(10-12), spawning a gigantic hot vortex in the stratosphere at 40 N that persisted for three years(13). Far from the storm, the Cassini temperature measurements showed a dramatic similar to 10 K cooling in the 0.5-5 mbar range across the entire equatorial region, disrupting the regular QPO pattern and significantly altering the middle-atmospheric wind structure, suggesting an injection of westward momentum into the equatorial wind system from waves generated by the northern storm. Hence, as on Earth, meteorological activity at mid-latitudes can have a profound effect on the regular atmospheric cycles in Saturn's tropics, demonstrating that waves can provide horizontal teleconnections between the phenomena shaping the middle atmospheres of giant planets.

This design is applicable for instruments where circularly symmetric feedhorns are required to mate with rectangular waveguide-fed receiver devices that house the detector chip. The transformer was fabricated by direct metal micromachining, which offers significant advantages in reducing the complexity, timescale, and cost of manufacturing over competing techniques, such as transformer segments machined into separate blocks or machined into splitblock segments. We simulate the tradeoff between the fabrication technique and the cost of rounding the edges of the rear rectangular waveguide. Simulations of the transformer circuitry using multiple electromagnetic software packages were used to finalize the dimensions of the optimized transformer. A single pixel feed-horntransf ormer module was manufactured on a three-axis milling machine to test the feasibility of the design and manufacturing technique. We tested the performance of the integrated feedhorntransformer modules using waveguide-fed hot electron bolometer mixers designed and fabricated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Radiation patterns of the Pickett-Potter modules were measured using a high-power 1.9 THz multiplication chain as the source. We find good agreement between the simulated and measured beam pattern.

Satellite- and Reanalysis-Based Mass Balance Estimates of Global Continental Discharge (1993-2015)	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN TEMPERATURE; SALINITY PROFILES; RIVER DISCHARGE; WATER DISCHARGE; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; CLIMATOLOGY; CYCLES; AMAZON	Total continental freshwater discharge into the oceans is a key feature of the global water cycle, but it is currently impossible to observe using ground-based methods alone. To characterize the uncertainty across existing modeling and satellite approaches, the authors present ensembles of historic monthly global continental discharge estimates that enforce water mass balance over land and ocean. The authors combine independent measurements of ocean-landmass change from altimetry and GRACE with multiple estimates of evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) from remote sensing and reanalysis data to compute 28 time series of global discharge. Results reveal agreement in mass budget across approaches but a large spread in global E-P estimates that propagates into the discharge estimates. It is found that discharges with reanalysis-based E-P provide a closer comparison with current observation-based estimates. After combining GRACE-and altimetry-based mass change estimates with moisture convergences from reanalysis, the total annual mean continental discharge into the oceans is 38 550 +/- 4800 km(-3) yr(-1). Last, the authors provide continent-wise discharge estimates from GRACE and moisture convergences over land, compare them to other studies, and discuss implications for ocean modeling.

Sampling the surface of a comet is a high priority for the New Frontiers program. Planetary simulants are crucial to the development of adequate in situ instruments and sample acquisition systems. A high-fidelity comet surface simulant has been developed to support hardware design and development for one Comet Surface Sample Return tool, the BiBlade Comet Sampler. Mechanical Porous Ambient Comet Simulants (MPACS) can be manufactured to cover a wide range of desired physical properties, such as' density and cone penetration resistance, and exhibit a brittle fracture mode. The structure of the MPACS materials is an aggregated composite structure of weakly-bonded grains of very small size (diameter <= 40 mu m) that are most relevant to the structure of the surface of a comet nucleus.

A Radio Relic and a Search for the Central Black Hole in the Abell 2261 Brightest Cluster Galaxy	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: jets; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: nuclei	HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; COMPACT SYMMETRIC OBJECTS; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; GALACTIC NUCLEI; BRIGHTNESS PROFILES; HOST GALAXIES; SKY SURVEY; CENTERS; CORE	We present VLA images and HST/STIS spectra of sources within the center of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in Abell 2261. These observations were obtained to test the hypothesis that its extremely large, flat core reflects the ejection of its supermassive black hole. Spectra of three of the four most luminous "knots" embedded in the core were taken to test whether one may represent stars bound to a displaced massive black hole. The three knots have radial velocity offsets (vertical bar Delta V vertical bar less than or similar to 150 km s(-1)) from the BCG. Knots 2 and 3 show kinematics, colors, and stellar masses consistent with infalling low-mass galaxies or larger stripped cluster members. Large errors in the stellar velocity dispersion of Knot 1, however, mean that we cannot rule out the hypothesis that it hosts a high-mass black hole. A2261-BCG has a compact, relic radio source offset by 6.5 kpc (projected) from the optical core's center, but no active radio core that would pinpoint the galaxy's central black hole to a tight 10 GHz flux limit <3.6 mu Jy. Its spectrum and morphology are suggestive of an active galactic nucleus that switched off >48 Myr ago, with an equipartition condition magnetic field of 15 mu G. These observations are still consistent with the hypothesis that the nuclear black hole has been ejected from its core, but the critical task of locating the supermassive black hole or demonstrating that A2261-BCG lacks one remains to be done.

J	Kim, W; Choi, YS				Kim, WonMoo; Choi, Yong-Sang			Long-term change of the atmospheric energy cycles and weather disturbances	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Energetics; Energy cascade; Baroclinic energy conversion; Reanalysis data; Data discrepancy; Climate change	POLAR AMPLIFICATION; ENERGETICS; TEMPERATURE; HUMIDITY; HIATUS	Weather disturbances are the manifestation of mean atmospheric energy cascading into eddies, thus identifying atmospheric energy structure is of fundamental importance to understand the weather variability in a changing climate. The question is whether our observational data can lead to a consistent diagnosis on the energy conversion characteristics. Here we investigate the atmospheric energy cascades by a simple framework of Lorenz energy cycle, and analyze the energy distribution in mean and eddy fields as forms of potential and kinetic energy. It is found that even the widely utilized independent reanalysis datasets, NCEP-DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis (NCEP2) and ERA-Interim (ERA-INT), draw different conclusions on the change of weather variability measured by eddy-related kinetic energy. NCEP2 shows an increased mean-to-eddy energy conversion and enhanced eddy activity due to efficient baroclinic energy cascade, but ERA-INT shows relatively constant energy cascading structure between the 1980s and the 2000s. The source of discrepancy mainly originates from the uncertainties in hydrological variables in the mid-troposphere. Therefore, much efforts should be made to improve mid-tropospheric observations for more reliable diagnosis of the weather disturbances as a consequence of man-made greenhouse effect.

The switching frequency of the hysteretic converter is digitally synchronized to the input clock reference with less than +/- 1.5% error in the switching frequency range of 3-9.5 MHz. The online offset calibration cancels the input-referred offset of the hysteretic comparator and enables +/- 1.1% voltage regulation accuracy. Maximum current-sharing error of +/- 3.6% is achieved by a duty-cycle-calibrated delay line-based pulsewidth modulation generator, without affecting the phase synchronization timing sequence. In light-load conditions, individual converter phases can be disabled, and the final stage power converter output stage is segmented for high efficiency. The dc-dc converter achieves 93% peak efficiency for V-i = 2 V and V-o = 1.6 V.

An Interferometric Approach to Cross-Track Clutter Detection in Two-Channel VHF Radar Sounders	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Clutter; interferometry; planetary radar; radar sounder (RS)	WEST ANTARCTICA; ICE; GLACIER; TOPOGRAPHY; DESIGN	Surface cross-track clutter can corrupt both earth and planetary radar sounder (RS) observations preventing definitive interpretation of subsurface features, which are often of primary interest to geologists and planetary scientists. This clutter is usually identified either by manual or automatic techniques that require ancillary information about the topography of the surface, or by using multichannel RS systems with arrays of antennas. However, topographic information is not always available and multichannel systems are generally too massive and costly to mount on satellites for the planetary exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to clutter discrimination that is independent of ancillary information and limits the hardware complexity of the RS system. This approach uses a two-channel RS and exploits cross-channel interferometric phase differences to discriminate the clutter. Our approach includes three main steps: 1) manual feature extraction and theoretical phase-difference estimation; 2) RS interferogram formation; and 3) comparison of theoretical and real phase difference distributions. The proposed method was validated on RS data acquired in Greenland and provides a proof of concept for the surface clutter discrimination using RS data.

Ice mass change in Greenland and Antarctica between 1993 and 2013 from satellite gravity measurements	JOURNAL OF GEODESY			English	Article						Time-variable Gravity; Mass change; Greenland; Antarctica	TIME-VARIABLE GRAVITY; GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; SEA-LEVEL CHANGE; CLIMATE EXPERIMENT; SHEET; GRACE; BALANCE; MODEL; RECOVERY; SYSTEM	We construct long-term time series of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet mass change from satellite gravity measurements. A statistical reconstruction approach is developed based on a principal component analysis (PCA) to combine high-resolution spatial modes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with the gravity information from conventional satellite tracking data. Uncertainties of this reconstruction are rigorously assessed; they include temporal limitations for short GRACE measurements, spatial limitations for the low-resolution conventional tracking data measurements, and limitations of the estimated statistical relationships between low- and high-degree potential coefficients reflected in the PCA modes. Trends of mass variations in Greenland and Antarctica are assessed against a number of previous studies. The resulting time series for Greenland show a higher rate of mass loss than other methods before 2000, while the Antarctic ice sheet appears heavily influenced by interannual variations.

J	Roa, J; Kasdin, NJ				Roa, Javier; Kasdin, N. Jeremy			Alternative Set of Nonsingular Quaternionic Orbital Elements	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							KUSTAANHEIMO-STIEFEL REGULARIZATION; N-BODY PROBLEM; CELESTIAL MECHANICS; TIME TRANSFORMATIONS; HYPERCOMPLEX FORM; KS-TRANSFORMATION; KEPLER-PROBLEM; GAUGE FREEDOM; INTEGRATION; MOTION	Quaternionic elements in orbital mechanics are usually related to the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation or to the definition of the orbital plane. The new set of regular elements presented in this paper stems from the form of the equations of motion of a rotating solid, which model the evolution of a quaternion defining the orientation of a body-fixed frame and the change in the angular velocity of such frame. By replacing the body-fixed frame with a special orbital frame and accounting for the radial motion separately, an equivalent solution to orbital motion can be constructed. The variation of parameters technique furnishes a new set of elements that is independent from the orbital plane. A second-order Sundman transformation introduces a fictitious time that replaces the physical time as the independent variable. This technique improves the numerical performance of the method and simplifies the derivation. The use of a time element yields an even smoother evolution of the orbital elements under perturbations. Once the Lagrange and Poisson brackets are obtained, the most general nonosculating version of the set of elements is presented. Regarding the performance, numerical experiments show that the method is comparable to other formulations involving similar stabilization and regularization techniques.	[Roa, Javier; Kasdin, N.

Measurements and modeling of long-path (CH4)-C-12 spectra in the 5300-5550 cm(-1) region	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						High resolution spectra; CH4; Methane; Tetradecad; Long path FTIR; Vibration-rotation states; Intensities; Infrared absorption; Effective Hamiltonian	EMPIRICAL LINE LISTS; M TRANSPARENCY WINDOW; 80 K; ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM; TETRAHEDRAL MOLECULES; POTENTIAL-ENERGY; 1ST ASSIGNMENT; GROUND-STATE; 2-NU(3) BAND; NU-4 BANDS	A new study of (CH4)-C-12 line positions and intensities was performed for part of the Tetradecad region between 5300 and 5550 cm(-1) using four long path (202 m, 602 m, 1604 m and 1804 m) spectra of normal samples of CH4 at different pressures recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer in Reims, France. Line positions and intensities were retrieved by least square curve-fitting procedures and analyzed using the effective Hamiltonian and the effective dipole moment expressed in terms of irreducible tensor operators adapted to spherical top molecules. An 80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched (CH4)-C-12 was used for low-J line positions. One other 80 K spectrum from JPL of enriched (CH4)-C-13 was used to discern the isotopic lines. A new measured linelist contains positions and intensities for 5934 features. Quantum assignments were made for 2847 transitions, which represent similar to 90% of the integrated line intensity observed in this region. All assigned line positions and 2227 selected line intensities were fitted with RMS standard deviations of 0.0025 cm(-1) and 8.6%, respectively. The sum of observed intensities between 5300 and 5550 cm(-1) fell within 2% of the predicted value from ab initio variational calculations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Nikitin, A.

Reexamining the mechanical property space of three-dimensional lattice architectures	ACTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Nanolattices; Nanoarchitected materials; Lattices; Cellular solids; Mechanics	CERAMIC NANOLATTICES; PHOTONIC CRYSTALS; HIGH-STRENGTH; FABRICATION; METAMATERIALS; 3D; ULTRALIGHT; DENSITY; ROUTE; FOAMS	Lightweight materials that are simultaneously strong and stiff are desirable for a range of applications from transportation to energy storage to defense. Micro- and nanolattices represent some of the lightest fabricated materials to date, but studies of their mechanical properties have produced inconsistent re sults that are not well captured by existing lattice models. We performed systematic nanomechanical experiments on four distinct geometries of solid polymer and hollow ceramic (AI(2)O(3)) nanolattices. All samples tested had a nearly identical scaling of strength (sigma(y)) and Young's modulus (E) with relative density ((rho)over-bar), ranging from (sigma(y)) infinity(rho)over-bar(145) top (rho)over-bar(1.92) and E infinity (rho)over-bar(1.41) to (rho)over-bar (1.83), revealing that changing topology alone does not necessarily have a significant impact on nanolattice mechanical properties. Finite element analysis was performed on solid and hollow lattices with structural parameters beyond those realized experimentally, enabling the identification of transition regimes where solid-beam lattices diverge from existing analytical theories and revealing the complex parameter space of hollow-beam lattices. We propose a simplified analytical model for solid-beam lattices that provides insight into the mechanisms behind their observed stiffness, and we investigate different hollow-beam lattice parameters that give rise to their aberrant properties. These experimental, computational and theoretical results uncover how architecture can be used to access unique lattice mechanical property spaces while demonstrating the practical limits of existing beam-based models in characterizing their behavior.

Third Photometry Data Release of Low-redshift Type Ia Supernovae and Other White Dwarf Explosions	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: photometers; supernovae: general; surveys; techniques: photometric	INFRARED STANDARD STARS; LIGHT CURVES; ABSOLUTE SPECTROPHOTOMETRY; DECLINE-RATE; SYSTEM; TELESCOPE; SEARCH; PROGENITOR; LUMINOSITY; COMPANION	We present final natural-system optical (ugriBV) and near-infrared (YJH) photometry of 134 supernovae (SNe) with probable white dwarf progenitors that were observed in 2004-2009 as part of the first stage of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I). The sample consists of 123 Type. Ia SNe, 5 Type. Iax SNe, 2 super-Chandrasekhar SN candidates, 2 Type. Ia SNe interacting with circumstellar matter, and 2 SN. 2006bt-like events. The redshifts of the objects range from z = 0.0037 to 0.0835; the median redshift is 0.0241. For 120 (90%) of these SNe, near-infrared photometry was obtained. Average optical extinction coefficients and color terms are derived and demonstrated to be stable during the five CSP-I observing campaigns. Measurements of the CSP-I near-infrared bandpasses are also described, and near-infrared color terms are estimated through synthetic photometry of stellar atmosphere models. Optical and near-infrared magnitudes of local sequences of tertiary standard stars for each supernova are given, and a new calibration of Y-band magnitudes of the Persson et al. standards in the CSP-I natural system is presented.

From new JHK1L' photometry and spectroscopy obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE, and Keck/NIRC2, and a reanalysis of the discovery data obtained with VLT/SPHERE, we derive colors, spectra, and astrometry for HD 131399 Ab. The broader wavelength coverage and higher data quality allow us to reinvestigate its status. Its near-infrared spectral energy distribution excludes spectral types later than L0 and is consistent with a K or M dwarf, which are the most likely candidates for a background object in this direction at the apparent magnitude observed. If it were a physically associated object, the projected velocity of HD 131399 Ab would exceed escape velocity given the mass and distance to HD 131399 A. We show that HD 131399 Ab is also not following the expected track for a stationary background star at infinite distance. Solving for the proper motion and parallax required to explain the relative motion of HD 131399 Ab, we find a proper motion of 12.3 mas yr(-1). When compared to predicted background objects drawn from a galactic model, we find this proper motion to be high but consistent with the top 4% fastest-moving background stars. From our analysis, we conclude that HD 131399 Ab is a background K or M dwarf.

OGLE Collaboration; KMTNet Grp; Spitzer Team	OGLE-2016-BLG-0168 Binary Microlensing Event: Prediction and Confirmation of the Microlens Parallax Effect from Space-based Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; gravitational lensing: micro	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; PHOTOMETRY; DISTANCES; SYSTEMS; SPITZER; PLANET; DWARF	The microlens parallax is a crucial observable for conclusively identifying the nature of lens systems in microlensing events containing or composed of faint (even dark) astronomical objects such as planets, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and black holes. With the commencement of a new era of microlensing in collaboration with space-based observations, the microlens parallax can be routinely measured. In addition, space-based observations can provide opportunities to verify the microlens parallax measured from ground-only observations and to find a unique solution to the lensing light-curve analysis. Furthermore, since most space-based observations cannot cover the full light curves of lensing events, it is also necessary to verify the reliability of the information extracted from fragmentary space-based light curves. We conduct a test based on the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0168, created by a binary lens system consisting of almost equal mass M-dwarf stars, to demonstrate that it is possible to verify the microlens parallax and to resolve degeneracies using the space-based light curve even though the observations are fragmentary. Since space-based observatories will frequently produce fragmentary light curves due to their short observing windows, the methodology of this test will be useful for next-generation microlensing experiments that combine space-based and ground-based collaboration.

Methodology and Planet Sensitivities of the 2015 High-cadence Spitzer Microlens Sample	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; methods: statistical; planetary systems; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; INITIAL MASS FUNCTION; MILKY-WAY; GAS GIANTS; STARS; BULGE; STELLAR; EVENTS; COMPANIONS; PARALLAXES	We analyze an ensemble of microlensing events from the 2015 Spitzer microlensing campaign, all of which were densely monitored by ground-based high-cadence survey teams. The simultaneous observations from Spitzer and the ground yield measurements of the microlensing parallax vector pi(E), from which compact constraints on the microlens properties are derived, including less than or similar to 25% uncertainties on the lens mass and distance. With the current sample, we demonstrate that the majority of microlenses are indeed in the mass range of M dwarfs. The planet sensitivities of all 41 events in the sample are calculated, from which we provide constraints on the planet distribution function. In particular, assuming a planet distribution function that is uniform in log q, where q is the planet-to-star mass ratio, we find a 95% upper limit on the fraction of stars that host typical microlensing planets of 49%, which is consistent with previous studies. Based on this planet-free sample, we develop the methodology to statistically study the Galactic distribution of planets using microlensing parallax measurements. Under the assumption that the planet distributions are the same in the bulge as in the disk, we predict that similar to 1/3 of all planet detections from the microlensing campaigns with Spitzer should be in the bulge. This prediction will be tested with a much larger sample, and deviations from it can be used to constrain the abundance of planets in the bulge relative to the disk.	[Zhu, Wei; Gould, A.; Pogge, R.

A stable vortex formed by early December and the early winter was exceptionally cold. Cold pool temperatures dropped below the nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) existence temperature of about 195 K, thus allowing polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) to form. The low temperatures in the polar stratosphere persisted until early March, allowing chlorine activation and catalytic ozone destruction. Satellite observations indicate that sedimentation of PSC particles led to denitrification as well as dehydration of stratospheric layers. Model simulations of the 2015/2016 Arctic winter nudged toward European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analysis data were performed with the atmospheric chemistry-climate model ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) for the Polar Stratosphere in a Changing Climate (POLSTRACC) campaign. POLSTRACC is a High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) mission aimed at the investigation of the structure, composition and evolution of the Arctic upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). The chemical and physical processes involved in Arctic stratospheric ozone depletion, transport and mixing processes in the UTLS at high latitudes, PSCs and cirrus clouds are investigated. In this study, an overview of the chemistry and dynamics of the 2015/2016 Arctic winter as simulated with EMAC is given. Further, chemical-dynamical processes such as denitrification, dehydration and ozone loss during the 2015/2016 Arctic winter are investigated. Comparisons to satellite observations by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS) as well as to airborne measurements with the Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA) performed aboard HALO during the POLSTRACC campaign show that the EMAC simulations nudged toward ECMWF analysis generally agree well with observations. We derive a maximum polar stratospheric O-3 loss of similar to 2 ppmv or 117DU in terms of column ozone in mid-March. The stratosphere was denitrified by about 48 ppbv HNO3 and dehydrated by about 0.6-1 ppmv H2O from the middle to the end of February. While ozone loss was quite strong, but not as strong as in 2010/2011, denitrification and dehydration were so far the strongest observed in the Arctic stratosphere in at least the past 10 years.

A New Generation of Tropical Cyclone Size Measurements from Space	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							FREQUENCY MICROWAVE RADIOMETER; GEOPHYSICAL MODEL FUNCTION; C-BAND; WIND STRUCTURE; SURFACE WIND; ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS; NORTH-ATLANTIC; HURRICANE; SEA; FOAM	Wind radii estimates in tropical cyclones (TCs) are crucial to helping determine the TC wind structure for the production of effective warnings and to constrain initial conditions for a number of applications. In that context, we report on the capabilities of a new generation of satellite microwave radiometers operating at L-band frequency (approximate to 1.4 GHz) and dual C band (approximate to 6.9 and 7.3 GHz). These radiometers provide wide-swath (>1,000 km) coverage at a spatial resolution of approximate to 40 km and revisit of approximate to 3 days. The L-band measurements are almost unaffected by rain and atmospheric effects, while dual C-band data offer an efficient way to significantly minimize these impacts. During storm conditions, increasing foam coverage and thickness at the ocean surface sufficiently modify the surface emissivity at these frequencies and, in turn, the brightness temperature (Tb) measurements. Based on aircraft measurements, new geophysical model functions have been derived to infer reliable ocean surface wind speeds from measured Tb variations. Data from these sensors collected over 2010-15 are shown to provide reliable estimates of the gale-force (34 kt), damaging (50 kt), and destructive winds (64 kt) within the best track wind radii uncertainty. Combined, and further associated with other available observations, these measurements can now provide regular quantitative and complementary surface wind information of interest for operational TC forecasting operations.

Incorporating a dependency on vapor pressure deficit, apparent underlying WUE (uWUE) provides a better indicator of how terrestrial ecosystems respond to environmental changes than other WUE formulations. Here we used 20th century simulations from four terrestrial biosphere models to develop a novel variance decomposition method. With this method, we attributed variations in apparent uWUE to both the trend and interannual variation of environmental drivers. The secular increase in atmospheric CO2 explained a clear majority of total variation (6632%: meanone standard deviation), followed by positive trends in nitrogen deposition and climate, as well as a negative trend in land use change. In contrast, interannual variation was mostly driven by interannual climate variability. To analyze the mechanism of the CO2 effect, we partitioned the apparent uWUE into the transpiration ratio (transpiration over evapotranspiration) and potential uWUE. The relative increase in potential uWUE parallels that of CO2, but this direct CO2 effect was offset by 204% by changes in ecosystem structure, that is, leaf area index for different vegetation types. However, the decrease in transpiration due to stomatal closure with rising CO2 was reduced by 84% by an increase in leaf area index, resulting in small changes in the transpiration ratio. CO2 concentration thus plays a dominant role in driving apparent uWUE variations over time, but its role differs for the two constituent components: potential uWUE and transpiration.

Mangrove trees rely on ocean surface currents to spread their hydrochorous propagules through space. Since pollen dispersal is generally restricted to local scales, high level of short-distance propagule dispersal is expected to result in FSGS in Rhizophora spp. We investigated FSGS, recent bottleneck events, as well as historical and contemporary expansion patterns in Rhizophora racemosa populations from the entire coast of Cameroon, using 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Populations of the Cameroon Estuary complex (CEC) showed significant FSGS and significant reduction in effective population sizes (recent bottlenecks), compared to the other areas. Additionally, our results indicate stark differences between historical and contemporary expansion models. These suggest that contemporary processes such as restricted propagule dispersal, bottleneck events from high indirect and direct anthropogenic pressure, and recolonization by founders from ancient local pockets/refugia most plausibly shape the patterns of FSGS in the CEC.

Changes in Jupiter's Zonal Wind Profile preceding and during the Juno mission	ICARUS			English	Article							SPEED JOVIAN JET; CASSINI IMAGES; CLOUD LEVEL; HOT-SPOTS; EQUATORIAL; ATMOSPHERE; DYNAMICS; FLOW; VARIABILITY; DISTURBANCE	We present five epochs of WFC3 HST Jupiter observations taken between 2009-2016 and extract global zonal wind profiles for each epoch. Jupiter's zonal wind field is globally stable throughout these years, but significant variations in certain latitude regions persist. We find that the largest uncertainties in the wind field are due to vortices or hot-spots, and show residual maps which identify the strongest vortex flows. The strongest year-to-year variation in the zonal wind profiles is the 24 degrees N jet peak. Numerous plume outbreaks have been observed in the Northern Temperate Belt and are associated with decreases in the zonal velocity and brightness. We show that the 24 degrees N jet peak velocity and brightness decreased in 2012 and again in late 2016, following outbreaks during these years. Our February 2016 zonal wind profile was the last highly spatially resolved measurement prior to Juno's first science observations. The final 2016 data were taken in conjunction with Juno's perijove 3 pass on 11 December 2016, and show the zonal wind profile following the plume outbreak at 24 degrees N in October 2016.

The random rough surface models were applied to soil surfaces and ocean surfaces. The discrete random media models were applied to snow and vegetation. For rough surface scattering, we use the surface integral equations of Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai that are solved by the method of moments using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions. The sparse matrix canonical grid method is used to accelerate the matrix column multiplications. In modeling the rough surfaces, we use the exponential correlation functions for soil surfaces and the Durden-Vesecky ocean spectrum for ocean surfaces. In scattering by terrestrial snow and snow on sea ice, we use the volume integral equations formulated with the dyadic half-space Green's function. The microstructure of snow is modeled by the bicontinuous media. In scattering by vegetation, we use the discrete scatterers of cylinder. The NMM3D formulation is based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations in conjunction with the body of revolution for a single scatterer. For rough surface scattering, simulations results are compared with advanced integral equation model, small slope approximation, small perturbation method, and two scale model. For volume scattering by snow, results are compared with the bicontinuous dense media radiative transfer. For scattering by vegetation, results are compared with distorted Born approximation and radiative transfer equation. Comparisons are also made with experiments.

The SMAP Level 4 Carbon Product for Monitoring Ecosystem Land-Atmosphere CO2 Exchange	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						CO2 fluxes; carbon cycle; ecosystems; environmental monitoring; microwave remote sensing; soil moisture; Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Mission; vegetation; water cycle	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; EDDY COVARIANCE; PROCESS MODEL; MOISTURE; SATELLITE; DIOXIDE	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product provides model estimates of the Net Ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) incorporating SMAP soil moisture information. The L4C product includes NEE, computed as total ecosystem respiration less gross photosynthesis, at a daily time step posted to a 9-km global grid by plant functional type. Component carbon fluxes, surface soil organic carbon stocks, underlying environmental constraints, and detailed uncertainty metrics are also included. The L4C model is driven by the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture data assimilation product, with additional inputs from the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 weather analysis, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite vegetation data. The L4C data record extends from March 31, 2015 to present with ongoing production and 8-12 day latency. Comparisons against concurrent global CO2 eddy flux tower measurements, satellite solar-induced canopy florescence, and other independent observation benchmarks show favorable L4C performance and accuracy, capturing the dynamic biosphere response to recent weather anomalies. Model experiments and L4C spatiotemporal variability were analyzed to understand the independent value of soil moisture and SMAP observations relative to other sources of input information. This analysis highlights the potential for microwave observations to inform models where soil moisture strongly controls land CO2 flux variability; however, skill improvement relative to flux towers is not yet discernable within the relatively short validation period. These results indicate that SMAP provides a unique and promising capability for monitoring the linked global terrestrial water and carbon cycles.

On the "Cal-Mode" Correction to TOPEX Satellite Altimetry and Its Effect on the Global Mean Sea Level Time Series	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						satellite altimetry; TOPEX; mean sea level	RADAR ALTIMETER; WAVE HEIGHT; ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION; TIDE GAUGES; JASON-1; TOPEX/POSEIDON; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY; HARVEST	Comparison of satellite altimetry against a high-quality network of tide gauges suggests that sea-surface heights from the TOPEX altimeter may be biased by 5 mm, in an approximate piecewise linear, or U-shaped, drift. This has been previously reported in at least two other studies. The bias is probably caused by use of an internal calibration-mode range correction, included in the TOPEX net instrument correction, which is suspect owing to changes in the altimeter's point target response. Removal of this correction appears to mitigate most of the drift problem. In addition, a new time series based on retracking the TOPEX waveforms, again without the calibration-mode correction, also reduces the drift aside for a clear problem during the first 2 years. With revision, the TOPEX measurements, combined with successor Jason altimeter measurements, show global mean sea level rising fairly steadily throughout most of 24 year time period, with rates around 3 mm/yr, although higher over the last few years.

Constraints on Ceres' Internal Structure and Evolution From Its Shape and Gravity Measured by the Dawn Spacecraft	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						gravity; topography; interiors; dwarf planet; isostasy; mascon	DWARF-PLANET CERES; ADAPTIVE OPTICS IMAGES; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; ELLIPSOID DIMENSIONS; SURFACE-TOPOGRAPHY; ASTEROIDS; VESTA; CRUST; FIELD; MARS	Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt with a radius of approximately 470km. In part due to its large mass, Ceres more closely approaches hydrostatic equilibrium than major asteroids. Pre-Dawn mission shape observations of Ceres revealed a shape consistent with a hydrostatic ellipsoid of revolution. The Dawn spacecraft Framing Camera has been imaging Ceres since March 2015, which has led to high-resolution shape models of the dwarf planet, while the gravity field has been globally determined to a spherical harmonic degree 14 (equivalent to a spatial wavelength of 211km) and locally to 18 (a wavelength of 164km). We use these shape and gravity models to constrain Ceres' internal structure. We find a negative correlation and admittance between topography and gravity at degree 2 and order 2. Low admittances between spherical harmonic degrees 3 and 16 are well explained by Airy isostatic compensation mechanism. Different models of isostasy give crustal densities between 1,200 and 1,400 kg/m(3) with our preferred model giving a crustal density of 1,28<mml:msubsup>7+70-87</mml:msubsup>kg/m(3). The mantle density is constrained to be 2,43<mml:msubsup>4+5-8</mml:msubsup>kg/m(3). We compute isostatic gravity anomaly and find evidence for mascon-like structures in the two biggest basins. The topographic power spectrum of Ceres and its latitude dependence suggest that viscous relaxation occurred at the long wavelengths (>246km). Our density constraints combined with finite element modeling of viscous relaxation suggests that the rheology and density of the shallow surface are most consistent with a rock, ice, salt and clathrate mixture. Plain Language Summary Ceres is the largest body in the asteroid belt. Unlike most of the objects in that region of the solar system, Ceres has a round shape due to its sufficient gravity. Little was known about Ceres before the Dawn mission. The measurements by the Dawn spacecraft allowed precise determination of Ceres' shape and gravity field. We use these two data sets to understand its internal structure. It was predicted in the past that Ceres topography would quickly viscously relax if Ceres had an icy crust. We find only a modest evidence of viscous relaxation, which implies that Ceres' crust is much stronger than water ice. We also find that Ceres topography is isostatically compensated. That is, much like with a floating iceberg, the weight of mountains is compensated by a displaced volume of the underlying mantle. Such a simple model explains most of Ceres' gravity anomalies. However, some gravity anomalies remain unaccounted for. For example, we find evidence for a mass concentration analogous to those in lunar maria in the two biggest impact basins. A strong negative anomaly is observed around Occatorthe famous bright spot crater. A strong positive anomaly is centered at Ahuna Monsa unique pyramid-shaped mountain. The globally averaged crustal density that we find is rather low. Remarkably, Ceres crust is made out of a strong, rock-like material that, however, has a density much lower than that of rocks. This implies that Ceres' crust contains a lot of salts and clathrates, which are strong and light materials.	[Ermakov, A. I.; Smith, D. E.; Zuber, M.

Analysis of IR-bright regions of Jupiter in JIRAM-Juno data: Methods and validation of algorithms	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; MODEL	In this paper, we detail the retrieval methods developed for the analysis of the spectral data from the JIRAM experiment on board of the Juno NASA mission [1], operating in orbit around Jupiter since July 2016. Our focus is on the analysis of the thermal radiation in the 5 pm transparency window in regions of lesser cloud opacity (namely, hot-spots). Moving from the preliminary analysis presented in [2], a retrieval scheme has been developed and implemented as a complete end-to-end processing software. Performances in terms of fit quality and retrieval errors are discussed from tests on simulated spectra, while some example and issue from usage on actual Jupiter data are also discussed. Following the suggestion originally presented in [3] for the analysis of the data from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on board of the NASA Galileo spacecraft, the state vector to be retrieved has been drastically simplified on physically sounding basis, aiming mostly to distinguish between the 'deep' content of minor gaseous components (H2O, NH3, PH3) and their relative humidity or fractional scale height in the upper troposphere. The retrieval code is based on a Bayesian scheme [4], complemented by simulated annealing method for most problematic cases. The key parameters retrievable from JIRAM individual spectra are the NH3 and PH3 deep contents, the H2O vapor relative humidity as well as the total aerosol opacity. Limitations related to the approximations of forward model methods are also assessed quantitatively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new statistical analysis of single-laser-shot spectra of igneous targets observed by ChemCam shows a strong peak at similar to 55wt% SiO2 and 6wt% total alkalis, with a minor secondary maximum at 47-51wt% SiO2 and lower alkali content. The centers of these distributions, together with the rock textures, indicate that many of the ChemCam igneous targets are trachybasalts, Mg#=27 but with a secondary concentration of basaltic material, with a focus of compositions around Mg#=54. We suggest that all of these igneous rocks resulted from low-pressure, olivine-dominated fractionation of Adirondack (MER) class-type basalt compositions. This magmatism has subalkaline, tholeiitic affinities. The similarity of the basalt endmember to much of the Gale sediment compositions in the first 1000 sols of the MSL mission suggests that this type of Fe-rich, relatively low-Mg#, olivine tholeiite is the dominant constituent of the Gale catchment that is the source material for the fine-grained sediments in Gale. The similarity to many Gusev igneous compositions suggests that it is a major constituent of ancient Martian magmas, and distinct from the shergottite parental melts thought to be associated with Tharsis and the Northern Lowlands. The Gale Crater catchment sampled a mixture of this tholeiitic basalt along with alkaline igneous material, together giving some analogies to terrestrial intraplate magmatic provinces.

DES Collaboration	OzDES multifibre spectroscopy for the Dark Energy Survey: 3-yr results and first data release	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; dark energy	SURVEY DESIGN; GALAXIES; TELESCOPE; IDENTIFICATION; MASSES; QUASAR	We present results for the first three years of OzDES, a six year programme to obtain redshifts for objects in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova fields using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey targeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multiyear baseline and is one of the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to dynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery. At the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100 supernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17 000 objects, including the redshifts of 2566 supernova hosts. We examine how our ability to measure redshifts for targets of various types depends on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), magnitude and exposure time, finding that our redshift success rate increases significantly at a S/N of 2-3 per 1-angstrom bin. We also find that the change in S/N with exposure time closely matches the Poisson limit for stacked exposures as long as 10 h. We use these results to predict the redshift yield of the full OzDES survey, as well as the potential yields of future surveys on other facilities such as (i.e. the 4-m Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph and the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer). This work marks the first OzDES data release, comprising 14 693 redshifts. OzDES is on target to obtain over 30 000 redshifts over the 6-yr duration of the survey, including a yield of approximately 5700 supernova host-galaxy redshifts.	[Childress, M.

We find competitive constraints in the Omega(m)-sigma(8) plane from the convergence PDF with 188 arcmin(2) pixels compared to the cosmic shear power spectrum with an equivalent number of modes (l < 886). The convergence PDF also partially breaks the degeneracy cosmic shear exhibits in that parameter space. A joint analysis of the convergence PDF and shear 2-point function also reduces the impact of shape measurement systematics, to which the PDF is less susceptible, and improves the total figure of merit by a factor of 2-3, depending on the level of systematics. Finally, we present a correction factor necessary for calculating the unbiased Fisher information from finite differences using a limited number of cosmological simulations.

Clay mineral formation under oxidized conditions and implications for paleoenvironments and organic preservation on Mars	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MOSSBAUER-SPECTROSCOPY; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; SILICATE MINERALS; CRYSTAL-CHEMISTRY; GALE CRATER; IRON; NONTRONITE; FE; SMECTITES; SAPONITE	Clay mineral-bearing locations have been targeted for martian exploration as potentially habitable environments and as possible repositories for the preservation of organic matter. Although organic matter has been detected at Gale Crater, Mars, its concentrations are lower than expected from meteoritic and indigenous igneous and hydrothermal reduced carbon. We conducted synthesis experiments motivated by the hypothesis that some clay mineral formation may have occurred under oxidized conditions conducive to the destruction of organics. Previous work has suggested that anoxic and/or reducing conditions are needed to synthesize the Fe-rich clay mineral nontronite at low temperatures. In contrast, our experiments demonstrated the rapid formation of Fe-rich clay minerals of variable crystallinity from aqueous Fe3+ with small amounts of aqueous Mg2+. Our results suggest that Fe-rich clay minerals such as nontronite can form rapidly under oxidized conditions, which could help explain low concentrations of organics within some smectite-containing rocks or sediments on Mars.

Data Assimilation to Extract Soil Moisture Information from SMAP Observations	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						data assimilation; SMAP soil moisture; neural networks; bias correction	NETWORK; PRECIPITATION; VALIDATION; PRODUCTS; SYSTEM; FIELDS; IMPACT	This study compares different methods to extract soil moisture information through the assimilation of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observations. Neural network (NN) and physically-based SMAP soil moisture retrievals were assimilated into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Catchment model over the contiguous United States for April 2015 to March 2017. By construction, the NN retrievals are consistent with the global climatology of the Catchment model soil moisture. Assimilating the NN retrievals without further bias correction improved the surface and root zone correlations against in situ measurements from 14 SMAP core validation sites (CVS) by 0.12 and 0.16, respectively, over the model-only skill, and reduced the surface and root zone unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) by 0.005 m respectively. The assimilation reduced the average absolute surface bias against the CVS measurements by 0.009 m. Assimilating the NN retrievals after a localized bias correction yielded slightly lower surface correlation and ubRMSE improvements, but generally the skill differences were small. The assimilation of the physically-based SMAP Level-2 passive soil moisture retrievals using a global bias correction yielded similar skill improvements, as did the direct assimilation of locally bias-corrected SMAP brightness temperatures within the SMAP Level-4 soil moisture algorithm. The results show that global bias correction methods may be able to extract more independent information from SMAP observations compared to local bias correction methods, but without accurate quality control and observation error characterization they are also more vulnerable to adverse effects from retrieval errors related to uncertainties in the retrieval inputs and algorithm. Furthermore, the results show that using global bias correction approaches without a simultaneous re-calibration of the land model processes can lead to skill degradation in other land surface variables.

J	Larour, E; Ivins, ER; Adhikari, S				Larour, Eric; Ivins, Erik R.; Adhikari, Surendra			Should coastal planners have concern over where land ice is melting?	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL RISE; GREENLAND; COLLAPSE; DRIVEN	There is a general consensus among Earth scientists that melting of land ice greatly contributes to sea-level rise (SLR) and that futurewarmingwill exacerbate the risks posed to human civilization. As land ice is lost to the oceans, both the Earth's gravitational and rotational potentials are perturbed, resulting in strong spatial patterns in SLR, termed sealevel fingerprints. We lack robust forecasting models for future ice changes, which diminishes our ability to use these fingerprints to accurately predict local sea-level (LSL) changes. We exploit an advanced mathematical property of adjoint systems and determine the exact gradient of sea-level fingerprints with respect to local variations in the ice thickness of all of the world's ice drainage systems. By exhaustively mapping these fingerprint gradients, we forma new diagnosis tool, henceforth referred to as gradient fingerprint mapping (GFM), that readily allows for improved assessments of future coastal inundation or emergence. Wedemonstrate that for Antarctica and Greenland, changes in the predictions of inundation at major port cities depend on the location of the drainage system. For example, in London, GFM shows LSL that is significantly affected by changes on the western part of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), whereas in New York, LSL change predictions are greatly sensitive to changes in the northeastern portions of the GrIS. We apply GFM to 293 major port cities to allow coastal planners to readily calculate LSL change as more reliable predictions of cryospheric mass changes become available.

The gravitational wave background from massive black hole binaries in Illustris: spectral features and time to detection with pulsar timing arrays	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational waves; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; quasars: supermassive black holes	EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS; DYNAMICAL FRICTION; SPHERICAL GALAXIES; N-BODY; EVOLUTION; ECCENTRICITY; RADIATION; MODEL; SIGNAL	Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) around the world are using the incredible consistency of millisecond pulsars to measure low-frequency gravitational waves from (super) massive black hole (MBH) binaries. We use comprehensive MBH merger models based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to predict the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We use real time-of-arrival specifications from the European, NANOGrav, Parkes, and International PTA (IPTA) to calculate realistic times to detection of the GWB across a wide range of model parameters. In addition to exploring the parameter space of environmental hardening processes (in particular: stellar scattering efficiencies), we have expanded our models to include eccentric binary evolution which can have a strong effect on the GWB spectrum. Our models show that strong stellar scattering and high characteristic eccentricities enhance the GWB strain amplitude near the PTA-sensitive 'sweet-spot' (near the frequency f = 1 yr(-1)), slightly improving detection prospects in these cases. While the GWB amplitude is degenerate between cosmological and environmental parameters, the location of a spectral turnover at low frequencies (f less than or similar to 0.1 yr(-1)) is strongly indicative of environmental coupling. At high frequencies (f greater than or similar to 1 yr(-1)), the GWB spectral index can be used to infer the number density of sources and possibly their eccentricity distribution. Even with merger models that use pessimistic environmental and eccentricity parameters, if the current rate of PTA expansion continues, we find that the IPTA is highly likely to make a detection within about 10 yr.

The Maria asteroid family	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; celestial mechanics; minor planets, asteroids: general	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; MAIN BELT; CHRONOLOGY; OBJECTS	The Maria asteroid family is a group of S-type asteroids. Its location adjacent to the left side of the 3J:-1A mean-motion resonances could be the reason for the absence of the left side of the 'V' shape in the (a, 1/D) domain. This family can be considered as a likely source of ordinary chondrite-like material. In this work, we make use of the time dependence of the asymmetric coefficient AS describing the degree of asymmetry of the C distribution of a fictitious Maria family generated with the value of the ejection velocity parameter VEJ = 35 ms(-1) to obtain an age estimate of 1750(+537)(-231) Myr, in good agreement with the family age found in the literature. Analysing the contribution to the near-Earth object (NEO) population, we found that about 7.6 per cent of presently known near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) have orbits similar to asteroids from the Maria family. Only similar to 1.7 per cent of our simulated family can stay in NEO space for more than 10 Myr, while only five asteroids become NEOs in the last 500 Myr of the simulation.

Statistical analysis of astrometric errors for the most productive asteroid surveys	ICARUS			English	Article						Astrometry; Asteroids; Orbit determination	PROGRAM	We performed a statistical analysis of the astrometric errors for the major asteroid surveys. We analyzed the astrometric residuals as a function of observation epoch, observed brightness and rate of motion, finding that astrometric errors are larger for faint observations and some stations improved their astrometric quality over time. Based on this statistical analysis we develop a new weighting scheme to be used when performing asteroid orbit determination. The proposed weights result in ephemeris predictions that can be conservative by a factor as large as 1.5. However, the new scheme is robust with respect to outliers and handles the larger errors for faint detections. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

UV superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with high efficiency, low noise, and 4 K operating temperature	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							VISIBLE-WAVELENGTH; SYSTEM EFFICIENCY; NM	For photon-counting applications at ultraviolet wavelengths, there are currently no detectors that combine high efficiency (> 50%), sub-nanosecond timing resolution, and sub-Hz dark count rates. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have seen success over the past decade for photon-counting applications in the near-infrared, but little work has been done to optimize SNSPDs for wavelengths below 400 nm. Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of UV SNSPDs operating at wavelengths between 250 and 370 nm. The detectors have active areas up to 56 mu m in diameter, 70 - 80% efficiency at temperatures up to 4.2 K, timing resolution down to 60 ps FWHM, blindness to visible and infrared photons, and dark count rates of similar to 0.25 counts/hr for a 56 mu m diameter pixel. These performance metrics make UV SNSPDs ideal for applications in trapped-ion quantum information processing, lidar studies of the upper atmosphere, UV fluorescent-lifetime imaging microscopy, and photon-starved UV astronomy.

First Application of the Zeeman Technique to Remotely Measure Auroral Electrojet Intensity From Space	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							EOS MLS; MICROWAVE; CONSTELLATION; TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE; CURRENTS; SYSTEM; OXYGEN; SWARM	Using the O-2 118 GHz spectral radiance measurements obtained by the Microwave Limb Sounder instrument on board the Aura spacecraft, we demonstrate that the Zeeman effect can be used to remotely measure the magnetic field perturbations produced by the auroral electrojet near the Hall current closure altitudes. Our derived current-induced magnetic field perturbations are found to be highly correlated with those coincidently obtained by ground magnetometers. These perturbations are also found to be linearly correlated with auroral electrojet strength. The statistically derived polar maps of our measured magnetic field perturbation reveal a spatial-temporal morphology consistent with that produced by the Hall current during substorms and storms. With today's technology, a constellation of compact, low-power, high-spectral-resolution cubesats would have the capability to provide high precision and spatiotemporal magnetic field samplings needed for auroral electrojet measurements to gain insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of the auroral electrojet system.

Here we quantify the relative contribution of ARs variability to both flood hazard and water availability. We find that globally, precipitation from ARs contributes 22% of total global runoff, with a number of regions reaching 50% or more. In areas where their influence is strongest, ARs may increase the occurrence of floods by 80%, while absence of ARs may increase the occurrence of hydrological droughts events by up to 90%. We also find that similar to 300 million people are exposed to additional floods and droughts due the occurrence of ARs. ARs provide a source of hydroclimatic variability whose beneficial or damaging effects depend on the capacity of water resources managers to predict and adapt to them.

Implications of Detection Methods on Characterizing Atmospheric River Contribution to Seasonal Snowfall Across Sierra Nevada, USA	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WESTERN UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; LANDFALLS; SATELLITE; IMPACTS; EVENTS	This study investigates the extent to which the diagnosed contribution of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to the seasonal cumulative snowfall (CS) is related to the AR detection approach utilized. Using both satellite integrated water vapor (IWV)-based and reanalysis integrated vapor transport (IVT)-based methodologies, the corresponding AR-derived CS distributions were characterized over the Sierra Nevada (USA) from 1998 to 2015. AR detection methods indicated that ARs yield greater orographic enhancement of the seasonal CS than non-AR storms above similar to 2,100-2,300 m for the IWV-based approach and over all elevations for the IVT-based detection approach across the western (i.e., windward) Sierra Nevada. Due to differences in the methodologies, the IWV-based approach diagnosed 2.1 times fewer ARs than the IVT-based approach. As a result, the ARs diagnosed using the IWV-based detection method yielded an average 33% of the total range-wide CS annually as opposed to 56% from the IVT-based detection method.

J	Cesana, G; Suselj, K; Brient, F				Cesana, Gregory; Suselj, Kay; Brient, Florent			On the Dependence of Cloud Feedbacks on Physical Parameterizations in WRF Aquaplanet Simulations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; ENSEMBLE; SCHEME; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; MICROPHYSICS; CONSTRAINTS; SPREAD	We investigate the effects of physical parameterizations on cloud feedback uncertainty in response to climate change. For this purpose, we construct an ensemble of eight aquaplanet simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In each WRF-derived simulation, we replace only one parameterization at a time while all other parameters remain identical. By doing so, we aim to (i) reproduce cloud feedback uncertainty from state-of-the-art climate models and (ii) understand how parametrizations impact cloud feedbacks. Our results demonstrate that this ensemble of WRF simulations, which differ only in physical parameterizations, replicates the range of cloud feedback uncertainty found in state-of-the-art climate models. We show that microphysics and convective parameterizations govern the magnitude and sign of cloud feedbacks, mostly due to tropical low-level clouds in subsidence regimes. Finally, this study highlights the advantages of using WRF to analyze cloud feedback mechanisms owing to its plug-and-play parameterization capability.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CLIMATE DATA; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; AUSTRALIA; HAZARD; RISK; RAINFALL; VALUES	Floods are costly to global economies and can be exceptionally lethal. The ability to produce consistent flood hazard maps over large areas could provide a significant contribution to reducing such losses, as the lack of knowledge concerning flood risk is a major factor in the transformation of river floods into flood disasters. In order to accurately reproduce flooding in river channels and floodplains, high spatial resolution hydrodynamic models are needed. Despite being computationally expensive, recent advances have made their continental to global implementation feasible, although inputs for long-term simulations may require the use of reanalysis meteorological products especially in data-poor regions. We employ a coupled hydrologic/hydrodynamic model cascade forced by the 20CRv2 reanalysis data set and evaluate its ability to reproduce flood inundation area and volume for Australia during the 1973-2012 period. Ensemble simulations using the reanalysis data were performed to account for uncertainty in the meteorology and compared with a validated benchmark simulation. Results show that the reanalysis ensemble capture the inundated areas and volumes relatively well, with correlations for the ensemble mean of 0.82 and 0.85 for area and volume, respectively, although the meteorological ensemble spread propagates in large uncertainty of the simulated flood characteristics.

On the Short-term Grounding Zone Dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, Observed With COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; ICE-SHEET; KOHLER GLACIERS; LINE RETREAT; TIDE MODEL; SHELF; MIGRATION; THWAITES; INSAR; SMITH	Using radar satellite data from the Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation and the German TanDEM-X formation, we present comprehensive measurements of the biweekly grounding line dynamics of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, from August to December 2015. The 1 day repeat cycle of CSK reveals tidally induced, grounding line migration on the scale of kilometers and extensive seawater intrusion within the grounding zone, which significantly exceeds that predicted for a stiff bed but are consistent with that calculated for a deformable bed. The deformable bed also explains the continuous draining/filling of subglacial lakes proximal to the grounding line. After correction for oceanic tides, we estimate a retreat rate for 2011-2015 of 0.3 km/yr at the glacier center and 0.5 km/yr on the sides, which is 3 times slower than for 1994-2011 (1.2 km/yr at the center). We attribute the decrease in retreat rate to colder ocean conditions in 2012-2013 relative to 2000-2011. Plain Language Summary Using short-term repeat satellite data from the Italian CSK constellation, we document significant tidal migration of the junction between ice and the ocean on the Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica, which is the largest contributor to sea level rise from Antarctica. The results imply that the junction is not fixed but corresponds to a zone several kilometers wide where ocean water melts ice from below. At present, numerical models of ice flow do not account for a flush zone. The existence of a flush zone should make the glacier more prone to retreat in response to warmer ocean waters.

The AIRS is on the Aqua satellite, which is in a polar orbit with two crossing times per day at every location on the Earth. Its measurements from the ascending (day) and descending (night) orbits can serve as a proxy for the diurnal cycle. The spatial pattern of the DTR of the skin temperature and its time variability for 14 years of the AIRS operation allows to evaluate the diurnal cycle change on the decadal time scale. Using the empirical mode decomposition of the data time series, it is found that the DTR of the surface (skin) temperature over the global Earth has a temporal small positive trend in the decade of the AIRS measurements indicating that the day temperatures grew slightly more rapidly than the night temperatures. A possible cause of the observed DTR increase is a decrease of the low cloud fraction at nighttime found for the same time period from the AIRS retrievals.

Development of Algorithm for Discriminating Hydrometeor Particle Types With a Synergistic Use of CloudSat and CALIPSO	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SURFACE REFERENCE TECHNIQUE; TRMM PRECIPITATION RADAR; MIXED-PHASE; WATER-CONTENT; CLIMATE; SCHEME; MODEL; MODIS; PARAMETERIZATION; SENSITIVITY	We developed a method for classifying hydrometeor particle types, including cloud and precipitation phase and ice crystal habit, by a synergistic use of CloudSat/Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)/Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). We investigated how the cloud phase and ice crystal habit characterized by CALIOP globally relate with radar reflectivity and temperature. The global relationship thus identified was employed to develop an algorithm for hydrometeor type classification with CPR alone. The CPR-based type classification was then combined with CALIPSO-based type characterization to give CPR-CALIOP synergy classification. A unique aspect of this algorithm is to exploit and combine the lidar's sensitivity to thin ice clouds and the radar's ability to penetrate light precipitation to offer more complete picture of vertically resolved hydrometeor type classification than has been provided by previous studies. Given the complementary nature of radar and lidar detections of hydrometeors, our algorithm delivers 13 hydrometeor types: warm water, supercooled water, randomly oriented ice crystal (3D-ice), horizontally oriented plate (2D-plate), 3D-ice + 2D-plate, liquid drizzle, mixed-phase drizzle, rain, snow, mixed-phase cloud, water + liquid drizzle, water + rain, and unknown. The global statistics of three-dimensional occurrence frequency of each hydrometeor type revealed that 3D-ice contributes the most to the total cloud occurrence frequency (53.8%), followed by supercooled water (14.3%), 2D-plate (9.2%), rain (5.9%), warm water (5.7%), snow (4.8%), mixed-phase drizzle (2.3%), and the remaining types (4.0%). This hydrometeor type classification provides observation-based insight for climate model diagnostics in representation of cloud phase and their microphysical characteristics.

Ground and Airborne UK Measurements of Nitryl Chloride: An Investigation of the Role of Cl Atom Oxidation at Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; TROPOSPHERIC DEGRADATION; N2O5; CLNO2; CHEMISTRY; IMPACT; ENVIRONMENT; MECHANISM	Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) measurements from the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (WAO) are reported from March to April 2013 using a quadruple chemical ionization mass spectrometer with the I- ionization scheme. WAO is a rural coastal site with generally low NOx concentrations, a type of location poorly studied for ClNO2 production. Concentrations of ClNO2 exceeded that of the limit of detection (0.8 ppt) on each night of the campaign, as did concentrations of N2O5, which was also measured simultaneously with the Cambridge Broadband Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectrometer. A peak concentration of 65 ppt of ClNO2 is reported here. Vertical profiles of ClNO2 from early-to middle-morning flights in close proximity to WAO are also reported, showing elevated concentrations at low altitude. The photolysis of observed ClNO2 and a box model utilizing the Master Chemical Mechanism modified to include chlorine chemistry was used to calculate Cl atom concentrations. This model utilized numerous VOCs from the second Tropospheric Organic Chemistry project in 2004, at the same location and time of year. From this the relative importance of the oxidation of three groups of measured VOCs (alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes) byOHradicals, Cl atoms, andO3 is compared. Cl atom oxidation was deemed generally insignificant at this time and location for total oxidation due to the much lower concentration of ClNO2 observed, even following the night of greatest ClNO2 production.

Assessment of upper tropospheric and stratospheric water vapor and ozone in reanalyses as part of S-RIP	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							QUASI-BIENNIAL OSCILLATIONS; PHOTOCHEMISTRY PARAMETERIZATION; TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE; MIDDLE STRATOSPHERE; POLAR VORTEX; CIRCULATION; SATELLITE; VALIDATION; TRANSPORT; ERA-40	Reanalysis data sets are widely used to understand atmospheric processes and past variability, and are often used to stand in as "observations" for comparisons with climate model output. Because of the central role of water vapor (WV) and ozone (O-3) in climate change, it is important to understand how accurately and consistently these species are represented in existing global reanalyses. In this paper, we present the results of WV and O-3 intercomparisons that have been performed as part of the SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes and their Role in Climate) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP). The comparisons cover a range of timescales and evaluate both inter-reanalysis and observation-reanalysis differences. We also provide a systematic documentation of the treatment of WV and O-3 in current reanalyses to aid future research and guide the interpretation of differences amongst reanalysis fields. The assimilation of total column ozone (TCO) observations in newer reanalyses results in realistic representations of TCO in reanalyses except when data coverage is lacking, such as during polar night. The vertical distribution of ozone is also relatively well represented in the stratosphere in reanalyses, particularly given the relatively weak constraints on ozone vertical structure provided by most assimilated observations and the simplistic representations of ozone photochemical processes in most of the reanalysis forecast models. However, significant biases in the vertical distribution of ozone are found in the upper troposphere and lower strato-sphere in all reanalyses. In contrast to O-3, reanalysis estimates of stratospheric WV are not directly constrained by assimilated data. Observations of atmospheric humidity are typically used only in the troposphere, below a specified vertical level at or near the tropopause. The fidelity of reanalysis stratospheric WV products is therefore mainly dependent on the reanalyses' representation of the physical drivers that influence stratospheric WV, such as temperatures in the tropical tropopause layer, methane oxidation, and the stratospheric overturning circulation. The lack of assimilated observations and known deficiencies in the representation of stratospheric transport in reanalyses result in much poorer agreement amongst observational and reanalysis estimates of stratospheric WV. Hence, stratospheric WV products from the current generation of reanalyses should generally not be used in scientific studies.

Wnt/beta-catenin activation and macrophage induction during liver cancer development following steatosis	ONCOGENE			English	Article							INTESTINAL STEM-CELLS; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; LIPID-METABOLISM; BETA-CATENIN; PERIPORTAL HEPATOCYTES; PROGENITOR CELLS; MICE LACKING; FATTY LIVER; PTEN; EXPRESSION	Obesity confers an independent risk for carcinogenesis. In the liver, steatosis often proceeds cancer formation; however, the mechanisms by which steatosis promotes carcinogenesis is unknown. We hypothesize that steatosis alters the microenvironment to promote proliferation of tumor initiating cells (TICs) and carcinogenesis. We used several liver cancer models to address the mechanisms underlying the role of obesity in cancer and verified these findings in patient populations. Using bioinformatics analysis and verified by biochemical assays, we identified that hepatosteatosis resulting from either Pten deletion or transgenic expression of HCV core/NS5A proteins, promotes the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin. We verified that high fat diet lipid accumulation is also capable of inducing Wnt/beta-catenin. Caloric restriction inhibits hepatosteatosis, reduces Wnt/beta-catenin activation and blocks the expansion of TICs leading to complete inhibition of tumorigenesis without affecting the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) loss regulated protein kinase B (AKT) activation. Pharmacological inhibition or loss of the Wnt/beta-catenin signal represses TIC growth in vitro, and decreases the accumulation of TICs in vivo. In human liver cancers, ontology analysis of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-defined Wnt signature genes indicates that Wnt signaling is significantly induced in tumor samples compared with healthy livers. Indeed, Wnt signature genes predict 90% of tumors in a cohort of 558 patient samples. Selective depletion of macrophages leads to reduction of Wnt and suppresses tumor development, suggesting infiltrating macrophages as a key source for steatosis-induced Wnt expression. These data established Wnt/beta-catenin as a novel signal produced by infiltrating macrophages induced by steatosis that promotes growth of tumor progenitor cells, underlying the increased risk of liver tumor development in obese individuals.

Microbial Community and Biochemical Dynamics of Biological Soil Crusts across a Gradient of Surface Coverage in the Central Mojave Desert	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						biological soil crusts; surface coverage; bacterial diversity; biochemistry; vertical column; topsoil; subsurface; metals	SUCCESSIONAL STAGES; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; COLORADO PLATEAU; DIVERSITY; ATP; CYANOBACTERIA; CLIMATE; MODEL	In this study, we expand upon the biogeography of biological soil crusts (BSCs) and provide molecular insights into the microbial community and biochemical dynamics along the vertical BSC column structure, and across a transect of increasing BSC surface coverage in the central Mojave Desert, CA, United States. Next generation sequencing reveals a bacterial community profile that is distinct among BSCs in the southwestern United States. Distribution of major phyla in the BSC topsoils included Cyanobacteria (33 +/- 8%), Proteobacteria (26 +/- 6%), and Chloroflexi (12 +/- 4%), with Phormidium being the numerically dominant genus. Furthermore, BSC subsurfaces contained Proteobacteria (23 +/- 5%), Actinobacteria (20 +/- 5%), and Chloroflexi (18 +/- 3%), with an unidentified genus from Chloroflexi (AKIW781, order) being numerically dominant. Across the transect, changes in distribution at the phylum (p < 0.0439) and genus (p < 0.006) levels, including multiple biochemical and geochemical trends (p < 0.05), positively correlated with increasing BSC surface coverage. This included increases in (a) Chloroflexi abundance, (b) abundance and diversity of Cyanobacteria, (b) OTU- level diversity in the topsoil, (c) OTU-level differentiation between the topsoil and subsurface, (d) intracellular ATP abundances and catalase activities, and (e) enrichments in clay, silt, and varying elements, including S, Mn, Co, As, and Pb, in the BSC topsoils. In sum, these studies suggest that BSCs from regions of differing surface coverage represent early successional stages, which exhibit increasing bacterial diversity, metabolic activities, and capacity to restructure the soil. Further, these trends suggest that BSC successional maturation and colonization across the transect are inhibited by metals/metalloids such as B, Ca, Ti, Mn, Co, Ni, Mo, and Pb.

Weak hydrothermal carbonation of the Ongeluk volcanics: evidence for low CO2 concentrations in seawater and atmosphere during the Paleoproterozoic global glaciation	PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Paleoproterozoic global glaciation; Ongeluk volcanics; Carbonation; Carbon and oxygen isotopes; Seawater/atmosphere CO2 level	BARBERTON GREENSTONE-BELT; SOUTH-AFRICA; SNOWBALL EARTH; PILBARA CRATON; OCEANIC-CRUST; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; FLOOR METAMORPHISM; ALTERATION ZONES; GREAT OXIDATION; DEGREES-C	It was previously revealed that the total CO2 concentration in seawater decreased during the Late Archean. In this paper, to assess the secular change of total CO2 concentration in seawater, we focused on the Paleoproterozoic era when the Earth experienced its first recorded global glaciation. The 2.4 Ga Ongeluk Formation outcrops in the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa. The formation consists mainly of submarine volcanic rocks that have erupted during the global glaciation. The undeformed lavas are mostly carbonate-free but contain rare disseminated calcites. The carbon isotope ratio of the disseminated calcite (delta(13)Ccc vs. VPDB) ranges from -31.9 to -13.2 %. The relatively low delta(13)Ccc values clearly indicate that the carbonation was partially contributed by C-13-depleted CO2 derived from decomposition of organic matter beneath the seafloor. The absence of delta(13)Ccc higher than -13.2% is consistent with the exceptionally C-13-depleted CO2 in the Ongeluk seawater during glaciation. The results suggest that carbonation occurred during subseafloor hydrothermal circulation just after the eruption of the lavas. Previously, it was reported that the carbonate content in the uppermost subseafloor crust decreased from 3.2 to 2.6 Ga, indicating a decrease in total CO2 concentration in seawater during that time. However, the average CO2 (as carbonate) content in the Ongeluk lavas (< 0.001 wt%) is much lower than those of 2.6 Ga representatives and even of modern equivalents. This finding suggests that the total CO2 concentration in seawater further decreased during the period between 2.6 and 2.4 Ga. Thus, the very low content of carbonate in the Ongeluk lavas is probable evidence for the extremely low CO2 concentration in seawater during the global glaciation. Considering that the carbonate content of the subseafloor crusts also shows a good correlation with independently estimated atmospheric pCO(2) levels through the Earth history, it seem highly likely that the low carbonate content in the Ongeluk lavas reflects the low atmospheric pCO(2) at that time. We conclude that the continuous decrease in CO2 concentration of seawater/atm. from 3.2 Ga was one of the contributing factors to the Paleoproterozoic global glaciation.

Quantifying TOLNet ozone lidar accuracy during the 2014 DISCOVER-AQ and FRAPPE campaigns	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							DIFFERENTIAL-ABSORPTION LIDAR; PROPOSED STANDARDIZED DEFINITIONS; IN-SITU MEASUREMENTS; TEMPERATURE ALGORITHMS; VERTICAL RESOLUTION; STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; UV SPECTROSCOPY; CROSS-SECTIONS; PROFILES; UNCERTAINTY	The Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) is a unique network of lidar systems that measure high-resolution atmospheric profiles of ozone. The accurate characterization of these lidars is necessary to determine the uniformity of the network calibration. From July to August 2014, three lidars, the TROPospheric OZone (TROPOZ) lidar, the Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol and oZone (TOPAZ) lidar, and the Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (LMOL), of TOLNet participated in the Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) mission and the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Experiment (FRAPPE) to measure ozone variations from the boundary layer to the top of the troposphere. This study presents the analysis of the intercomparison between the TROPOZ, TOPAZ, and LMOL lidars, along with comparisons between the lidars and other in situ ozone instruments including ozonesondes and a P-3B airborne chemiluminescence sensor. The TOLNet lidars measured vertical ozone structures with an accuracy generally better than +/- 15% within the troposphere. Larger differences occur at some individual altitudes in both the near-field and far-field range of the lidar systems, largely as expected. In terms of column average, the TOLNet lidars measured ozone with an accuracy better than +/- 5% for both the intercomparison between the lidars and between the lidars and other instruments. These results indicate that these three TOLNet lidars are suitable for use in air quality, satellite validation, and ozone modeling efforts.

The Weak Lensing Masses of the CFHTLS and NGVS RedGOLD Galaxy Clusters and Calibration of the Optical Richness	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; gravitational lensing: weak	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; X-RAY; DEEP-FIELD; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; WIDE-FIELD; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; SCALING RELATIONS; ADVANCED CAMERA; EVOLUTION; CATALOG	We measured stacked weak lensing cluster masses for a sample of 1323 galaxy clusters detected by the RedGOLD algorithm in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey W1 and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey at 0.2 < z < 0.5, in the optical richness range 10 < lambda< 70. This is the most comprehensive lensing study of a similar to 100% complete and similar to 80% pure optical cluster catalog in this redshift range. We test different mass models, and our final model includes a basic halo model with a Navarro Frenk and White profile, as well as correction terms that take into account cluster miscentering, non-weak shear, the two-halo term, the contribution of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, and an a posteriori correction for the intrinsic scatter in the mass-richness relation. With this model, we obtain a mass-richness relation of log M-200/M-circle dot = (14.46 +/- 0.02)+(1.04 +/- 0.09) log(lambda/40) (statistical uncertainties). This result is consistent with other published lensing mass-richness relations. We give the coefficients of the scaling relations between the lensing mass and X-ray mass proxies, L-X and T-X, and compare them with previous results. When compared to X-ray masses and mass proxies, our results are in agreement with most previous results and simulations, and consistent with the expected deviations from self-similarity.

NuSTAR Hard X-Ray Observation of the Gamma-Ray Binary Candidate HESS J1832-093	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma rays: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; X-rays: binaries	DEEP CHANDRA OBSERVATIONS; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; LS 5039; PSR B1259-63; PULSAR WIND; PERIASTRON PASSAGE; TEV BINARIES; EMISSION; DISCOVERY; SYSTEM	We present a hard X-ray observation of the TeV gamma-ray binary candidate HESS J1832-093, which is coincident with the supernova remnant G22.7-0.2, using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. Non-thermal X-ray emission from XMMU. J183245-0921539, the X-ray source associated with HESS. J1832-093, is detected up to similar to 30. keV and is well-described by an absorbed power-law model with a best-fit photon index Gamma= 1.5 +/- 0.1. A re-analysis of archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data finds that the long-term X-ray flux increase of XMMU J183245-0921539 is 50(20)(+40)% (90%C.L.), much less than previously reported. A search for a pulsar spin period or binary orbit modulation yields no significant signal to a pulse fraction limit of f(p) < 19% in the range 4 ms < P < 40 ks. No red noise is detected in the FFT power spectrum to suggest active accretion from a binary system. While further evidence is required, we argue that the X-ray and gamma-ray properties of XMMU. J183245-0921539 are most consistent with a non-accreting binary generating synchrotron X-rays from particle acceleration in the shock formed as a result of the pulsar and stellar wind collision. We also report on three nearby hard X-ray sources, one of which may be associated with diffuse emission from a fast-moving supernova fragment interacting with a dense molecular cloud.

When complete, this survey will cover 10,000 deg(2) of the northern sky. By combing the CFHT u-band photometry together with Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Pan-STARRS g, r, and i, we demonstrate that we are able to reliably measure the metallicities of individual stars to similar to 0.2. dex, and hence additionally obtain good photometric distance estimates. This survey thus permits the measurement of metallicities and distances of the dominant main-sequence (MS) population out to approximately 30 kpc, and provides a much higher number of stars at large extraplanar distances than have been available from previous surveys. We develop a non-parametric distance-metallicity decomposition algorithm and apply it to the sky at 30 degrees < vertical bar b vertical bar < 70 degrees and to the North Galactic Cap. We find that the metallicity-distance distribution is well-represented by three populations whose metallicity distributions do not vary significantly with vertical height above the disk. As traced in MS stars, the stellar halo component shows a vertical density profile that is close to exponential, with a scale height of around 3 kpc. This may indicate that the inner halo was formed partly from disk stars ejected in an ancient minor merger.

In this first contribution, we present the u-band component of the survey, describe the observational strategy, and discuss some first highlight results, based on approximately one-third of the final area. We show that the Galactic anticenter structure is distributed continuously along the line of sight, out to beyond 20 kpc, and possesses a metallicity distribution that is essentially identical to that of the outer disk sampled by APOGEE. This suggests that it is probably a buckled disk of old metal-rich stars, rather than a stream or a flare. We also discuss the future potential for CFIS-u in discovering star-forming dwarf galaxies around the Local Group, the characterization of the white dwarf and blue straggler population of the Milky Way, as well as its sensitivity to low surface brightness structures in external galaxies.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of similar to 1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg(2) at a luminosity distance of 40(-8)(+8) Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M-circle dot. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at similar to 40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over similar to 10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position similar to 9 and similar to 16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.

UV, Optical, and Near-infrared Light Curves and Comparison to Kilonova Models	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						binaries: close; catalogs; gravitational waves; stars: neutron; surveys	SUPERNOVAE; OUTFLOWS; PROJECT; PROGRAM	We present UV, optical, and near-infrared (NIR) photometry of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source from Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo, the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Our data set extends from the discovery of the optical counterpart at 0.47-18.5 days post-merger, and includes observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/ FLAMINGOS-2 (GS/F2), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectral energy distribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at 0.6 days is well described by a blackbody model with T approximate to 8300 K, a radius of R approximate to 4.5 x 10(14) cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of v approximate to 0.3c), and a bolometric luminosity of L-bol approximate to 5 x 10(41) erg s(-1). At 1.5 days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and NIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands and significant reddening of the optical/ NIR colors. Modeling the entire data set, we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of Ni-56, or those with only a single component of opacity from r-process elements, fail to capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead, models with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich ejecta provide a good fit to the data; the resulting "blue" component has M-ej(blue) approximate to 0.01 M-circle dot and v(ej)(blue) approximate to 0.3c, and the "red" component has M-cj(red) approximate to 0.04 M-circle dot and v(cj)(red) approximate to 0.1 c. These ejecta masses are broadly consistent with the estimated r-process production rate required to explain the Milky Way r-process abundances, providing the first evidence that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be a dominant site of r-process enrichment.

Dark Energy Survey Dark Energy	The Electromagnetic Counterpart of the Binary Neutron Star Merger LIGO/Virgo GW170817. I. Discovery of the Optical Counterpart Using the Dark Energy Camera	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						binaries: close; catalogs; gravitational waves; stars: neutron; surveys	BURSTS	We present the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) discovery of the optical counterpart of the first binary neutron star merger detected through gravitational-wave emission, GW170817. Our observations commenced 10.5 hr post-merger, as soon as the localization region became accessible from Chile. We imaged 70 deg(2) in the i and z bands, covering 93% of the initial integrated localization probability, to a depth necessary to identify likely optical counterparts (e.g., a kilonova). At 11.4 hr post-merger we detected a bright optical transient located 10 ''.6 from the nucleus of NGC 4993 at redshift z = 0.0098, consistent (for H-0 = 70 km s(-1) Mpc(-1)) with the distance of 40 +/- 8 Mpc reported by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration (LVC). At detection the transient had magnitudes of i = 17.3 and z = 17.4, and thus an absolute magnitude of M-i = -15.7, in the luminosity range expected for a kilonova. We identified 1500 potential transient candidates. Applying simple selection criteria aimed at rejecting background events such as supernovae, we find the transient associated with NGC 4993 as the only remaining plausible counterpart, and reject chance coincidence at the 99.5% confidence level. We therefore conclude that the optical counterpart we have identified near NGC 4993 is associated with GW170817. This discovery ushers in the era of multi-messenger astronomy with gravitational waves and demonstrates the power of DECam to identify the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources.

Gas bubbling observed during remotely operated vehicle (ROV)-assisted sampling of MDAC crusts revealed ongoing seep activity. Authigenic carbonates were present as crusts on the seafloor and as centimetresize carbonate-cemented nodules at several intervals within an adjacent sediment core. Aragonite-dominated mineralogy of the MDAC crusts suggests formation close to the seafloor at higher rates of sulphate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). In contrast, dolomite-cemented nodules are consistent with the formation at the sulphate-methane-transition zone deeper within the sediment at lower rates of AOM. The delta C-13-carbonate values of bulk rock and of micro-drilled aragonite samples vary between -22.2% and -34.6% (VPDB). We interpret the carbon in aragonite to be mainly derived from the anaerobic oxidation of thermogenic methane, with a minor contribution from seawater dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). AOM activity is supported by high concentrations of AOM-related biomarkers of archaea (archaeol and 2-sn-hydroxyarchaeol) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (iso and anteiso-C-15:0 fatty acids) in the crusts. The dolomite nodules exhibit higher delta C-13-carbonate values (-12% VPDB) suggesting a smaller amount of methane-derived carbon, presumably due to the contribution of DIC migrating from depth, and lower AOM rates. The latter is supported by orders of magnitude lower concentrations of archaeol and sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol in the sediment interval containing the largest dolomite nodules. delta O-18 values of pure aragonite samples and dolomite nodules indicate the precipitation of carbonate close to isotopic equilibrium with seawater and no influence of gas hydrate-derived water. U-Th dating of two MDAC crusts shows that they formed between 1.61 +/- 0.02 and 4.39 +/- 1.63 ka BP and between 2.65 +/- 0.02 and 4.32 +/- 0.08 ka BP. We infer both a spatial and temporal change in methane flux and related MDAC formation at this seep site. These changes might be caused by regional seismic events that can affect pore pressure or re-activation of migration pathways thus facilitating fluid flow from deep sources towards the seabed.

The column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) observations from satellites and ground-based networks are analyzed together with in situ observations for the period of September 2014 to October 2016. From the differences between satellite (OCO-2) observations and simulations using an atmospheric chemistry-transport model, we estimate that, relative to the mean annual fluxes for 2014, the most recent El Nino has contributed to an excess CO2 emission from the Earth's surface (land + ocean) to the atmosphere in the range of 2.4 +/- 0.2 PgC (1 Pg = 10(15) g) over the period of July 2015 to June 2016. The excess CO2 flux is resulted primarily from reduction in vegetation uptake due to drought, and to a lesser degree from increased biomass burning. It is about the half of the CO2 flux anomaly (range: 4.4-6.7 PgC) estimated for the 1997/1998 El Nino. The annual total sink is estimated to be 3.9 +/- 0.2 PgC for the assumed fossil fuel emission of 10.1 PgC.

Airborne DOAS retrievals of methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor concentrations at high spatial resolution: application to AVIRIS-NG	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							COLUMN-AVERAGED METHANE; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; TRACE GASES; SPECTROMETER SYSTEM; PIPELINE LEAKS; FOSSIL-FUEL; LOS-ANGELES; 4 CORNERS; EMISSIONS; QUANTIFICATION	At local scales, emissions of methane and carbon dioxide are highly uncertain. Localized sources of both trace gases can create strong local gradients in its columnar abundance, which can be discerned using absorption spectroscopy at high spatial resolution. In a previous study, more than 250 methane plumes were observed in the San Juan Basin near Four Corners during April 2015 using the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) and a linearized matched filter. For the first time, we apply the iterative maximum a posteriori differential optical absorption spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) method to AVIRIS-NG data and generate gas concentration maps for methane, carbon dioxide, and water vapor plumes. This demonstrates a comprehensive greenhouse gas monitoring capability that targets methane and carbon dioxide, the two dominant anthropogenic climate-forcing agents. Water vapor results indicate the ability of these retrievals to distinguish between methane and water vapor despite spectral interference in the shortwave infrared. We focus on selected cases from anthropogenic and natural sources, including emissions from mine ventilation shafts, a gas processing plant, tank, pipeline leak, and natural seep. In addition, carbon dioxide emissions were mapped from the flue-gas stacks of two coal-fired power plants and a water vapor plume was observed from the combined sources of cooling towers and cooling ponds. Observed plumes were consistent with known and suspected emission sources verified by the true color AVIRIS-NG scenes and higher-resolution Google Earth imagery. Real-time detection and geolocation of methane plumes by AVIRIS-NG provided unambiguous identification of individual emission source locations and communication to a ground team for rapid follow-up. This permitted verification of a number of methane emission sources using a thermal camera, including a tank and buried natural gas pipeline.

Development of lithium attachment mass spectrometry - knudsen effusion and chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (KEMS, CIMS)	ANALYST			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLSURECENT DEVELOPMENTS; SATURATION VAPOR-PRESSURES; ION ATTACHMENT; CAMPAIGN; AEROSOL; LONDON; ACIDS; LI+	Lithium ion attachment mass spectrometry provides a non-specific, non-fragmenting, sensitive and robust method for the detection of volatile species in the gas phase. The design, manufacture and results of lithium based ion attachment ionisation sources for two different mass spectrometry systems are presented. In this study trace gas analysis is investigated using a modified Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS) and vapour pressure measurements are made using a modified Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometer (KEMS). In the Li+ CIMS, where the Li+ ionization acts a soft and unselective ionization source, limits of detection of 0.2 ppt for formic acid, 15 ppt for nitric acid and 120 ppt for ammonia were achieved, allowing for ambient measurements of such species at atmospherically relevant concentrations. In the first application of Lithium ion attachment in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), vapor pressures of various atmospherically relevant species were measured with the adapted KEMS, giving measured values equivalent to previous results from electron impact KEMS. In the Li+ KEMS vapour pressures < 10-3 mbar can be measured without any fragmentation, as is seen with the initial electron impact (EI) set up, allowing the vapor pressure of individual components within mixtures to be determined.

A.; Crisp, David			Quantifying CO2 Emissions From Individual Power Plants From Space	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						CO2 emissions; satellite; coal; climate change; anthropogenic; power plant	PERFORMANCE; ORBIT	In order to better manage anthropogenic CO2 emissions, improved methods of quantifying emissions are needed at all spatial scales from the national level down to the facility level. Although the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite was not designed for monitoring power plant emissions, we show that in some cases, CO2 observations from OCO-2 can be used to quantify daily CO2 emissions from individual middle- to large-sized coal power plants by fitting the data to plume model simulations. Emission estimates for U.S. power plants are within 1-17% of reported daily emission values, enabling application of the approach to international sites that lack detailed emission information. This affirms that a constellation of future CO2 imaging satellites, optimized for point sources, could monitor emissions from individual power plants to support the implementation of climate policies. Plain Language Summary Burning coal for electricity generation accounts for more than 40% of humanity's current global CO2 emissions. To better manage CO2 emissions, improved methods of quantifying emissions are needed at all spatial scales. Although the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite was not designed for monitoring power plant emissions, we show that in select cases, CO2 observations from OCO-2 can be used to quantify daily CO2 emissions from individual middle- to large-sized coal power plants by fitting the data to a simple model. Demonstrating the method on U.S. power plants with reliable reported emission data enabled application of the approach to international sites that have less or lower quality information available on emissions. Space agencies around the world are currently exploring how to design satellite missions to help address climate change and support Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) of CO2 emissions for climate agreements. This work affirms that a constellation of CO2 imaging satellites, with a design optimized for point sources, could monitor CO2 emissions from individual fossil fuel burning power plants to support that objective.

Application of a PCA-Based Fast Radiative Transfer Model to XCO2 Retrievals in the Shortwave Infrared	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							SCATTERING; CO2; UNCERTAINTIES; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM	In this work, we extend the principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to accelerate radiative transfer (RT) calculations by accounting for the spectral variation of aerosol properties. Using linear error analysis, the errors induced by this fast RT method are quantified for a large number of simulated Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) measurements (N approximate to 30,000). The computational speedup of the approach is typically 2 orders of magnitude compared to a line-by-line discrete ordinates calculation with 16 streams, while the radiance residuals do not exceed 0.01% for the most part compared to the same baseline calculations. We find that the errors due to the PCA-based approach tend to be less than 0.06ppm for both land and ocean scenes when two or more empirical orthogonal functions are used. One advantage of this method is that it maintains the high accuracy over a large range of aerosol optical depths. This technique shows great potential to be used in operational retrievals for GOSAT and other remote sensing missions.

Observed Covariations of Aerosol Optical Depth and Cloud Cover in Extratropical Cyclones	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						aerosol optical depth; MODIS; cloud cover; Cloudsat-CALIPSO; extratropical cyclones	MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES; THERMODYNAMIC PHASE; PRECIPITATION; MODIS; CLIMATE; WARM; NORTHERN; PACIFIC; STORMS; WINTER	Using NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol optical depth and total cloud cover retrievals, CloudSat-CALIPSO cloud profiles, and a database of extratropical cyclones and frontal boundary locations, relationships between changes in aerosol optical depth and cloud cover in extratropical cyclones occurring over Northern Hemisphere oceans are examined. A reanalysis data set is used to constrain column water vapor and ascent strength in the cyclones in an attempt to distinguish their impact on cloud cover from the effect of changes in aerosol loading. The results suggest that high aerosol optical depth cyclones exhibit larger middle- and high-level cloud cover than their low aerosol optical depth counterparts. However, the opposite behavior is found for low-level cloud cover. These relationships are found to depend on the large-scale environment, in particular the column water vapor and vertical motion. Despite the inability of the observations to provide a causal physical link between aerosol load and cloud cover, these results can help to constrain and evaluate model simulations.

Development of a Polar Stratospheric Cloud Model Within the Community Earth System Model: Assessment of 2010 Antarctic Winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							OZONE DEPLETION; VAPOR-PRESSURES; GRAVITY-WAVES; NITRIC-ACID; ICE; WATER; LIDAR; SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; NUCLEATION	To simulate polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) during the Antarctic winter of 2010, we have developed a PSC model within the Community Earth System Model framework that includes detailed microphysics of sulfuric aerosols and three types of PSCs: supercooled ternary solution (STS), nitric acid trihydrate (NAT), and ice. Our model includes two major NAT formation mechanisms, both of which are essential to reproduce the PSC and gas phase chemical features in the 2010 Antarctic winter. Homogeneous nucleation of NAT from STS produces NAT particles with sizes near 8m, which are important to properly simulate denitrification and the gas phase HNO3 observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). Heterogeneous nucleation of NAT on ice particles or ice particles on NAT and subsequent evaporation of the ice produces NAT particles with sizes from submicrometers to a few micrometers. These particles account for the large backscattering ratio from NAT observed by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations satellite, especially in the midwinter season. Adding temperature fluctuations from gravity waves is important to produce larger number density and higher backscattering ratio from ice and NAT particles. However, our model needs a better representation of waves to improve the backscattering ratio and gas phase HNO3 compared with observations.

Associations are computed as the percent of extreme temperature months concurrent with the upper and lower quartiles of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index distributions, stratified by season. The relationship is strongest for ENSO, with nearly every extreme temperature month concurrent with the upper or lower quartiles of its distribution in portions of northwestern South America during some seasons. The likelihood of extreme warm temperatures is enhanced over parts of northern South America when the Atlantic Nino index is in the upper quartile, while cold extremes are often association with the lowest quartile. Concurrent precipitation anomalies may contribute to these relations. The PDO shows weak associations during December, January, and February, while in June, July, and August its relationship with extreme warm temperatures closely matches that of ENSO. This may be due to the positive relationship between the PDO and ENSO, rather than the PDO acting as an independent physical mechanism. Over Patagonia, the SAM is highly influential during spring and fall, with warm and cold extremes being associated with positive and negative phases of the SAM, respectively. Composites of sea level pressure anomalies for extreme temperature months over Patagonia suggest an important role of local synoptic scale weather variability in addition to a favorable SAM for the occurrence of these extremes.

Evidence for the Interior Evolution of Ceres from Geologic Analysis of Fractures	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ICE; DIFFERENTIATION	Ceres is the largest asteroid belt object, and the Dawn spacecraft observed Ceres since 2015. Dawn observed two morphologically distinct linear features on Ceres's surface: secondary crater chains and pit chains. Pit chains provide unique insights into Ceres's interior evolution. We interpret pit chains called the Samhain Catenae as the surface expression of subsurface fractures. Using the pit chains' spacings, we estimate that the localized thickness of Ceres's fractured, outer layer is approximately >= 58 km, at least similar to 14km greater than the global average. We hypothesize that extensional stresses, induced by a region of upwelling material arising from convection/diapirism, formed the Samhain Catenae. We derive characteristics for this upwelling material, which can be used as constraints in future interior modeling studies. For example, its predicted location coincides with Hanami Planum, a high-elevation region with a negative residual gravity anomaly, which may be surficial evidence for this proposed region of upwelling material.

Large-format platinum silicide microwave kinetic inductance detectors for optical to near-IR astronomy	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article								We have fabricated and characterized 10,000 and 20,440 pixel Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) arrays for the Dark-speckle Near-IR Energy-resolved Superconducting Spectrophotometer (DARKNESS) and the MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC). These instruments are designed to sit behind adaptive optics systems with the goal of directly imaging exoplanets in a 800-1400 nm band. Previous large optical and near-IR MKID arrays were fabricated using substoichiometric titanium nitride (TiN) on a silicon substrate. These arrays, however, suffered from severe non-uniformities in the TiN critical temperature, causing resonances to shift away from their designed values and lowering usable detector yield. We have begun fabricating DARKNESS and MEC arrays using platinum silicide (PtSi) on sapphire instead of TiN. Not only do these arrays have much higher uniformity than the TiN arrays, resulting in higher pixel yields, they have demonstrated better spectral resolution than TiN MKIDs of similar design. PtSi MKIDs also do not display the hot pixel effects seen when illuminating TiN on silicon MKIDs with photons with wavelengths shorter than 1 mu m.

Rapid drawdown of Antarctica's Wordie Ice Shelf glaciers in response to ENSO/Southern Annular Mode-driven warming in the Southern Ocean	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Antarctic glaciology; ocean warming; glacier change; atmosphere-ocean interaction	CIRCUMPOLAR DEEP-WATER; FLEMING GLACIER; BASAL MELT; PENINSULA; CIRCULATION; SENSITIVITY; TRANSPORT; FLOW	Here we investigate the largest acceleration in ice flow across all of Antarctica between similar to 2008 InSAR and 2014 Landsat velocity mappings. This occurred in glaciers that used to feed into the Wordie Ice Shelf on the west Antarctic Peninsula, which rapidly disintegrated in similar to 1989. Between 2008 and 2014, these glaciers experienced at least a threefold increase in surface elevation drawdown relative to the 2002-2008 time period. After similar to 20 yrs of relative stability, it is unlikely that the ice shelf collapse played a role in the large response. Instead, we find that the rapid acceleration and surface drawdown is linked to enhanced melting at the ice-ocean boundary, attributable to changes in winds driven by global atmospheric circulation patterns, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), linking changes in grounded ice to atmospheric-driven ocean warming.

The interior structure of Ceres as revealed by surface topography	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Ceres; geodynamics; geophysics; rheology; internal structure; differentiation	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; NUMERICAL-MODELS; CV3 CHONDRITES; SOLAR-SYSTEM; GRAIN-SIZE; ROCK-SALT; WATER ICE; DEFORMATION; STRENGTH; RHEOLOGY	Ceres, the largest body in the asteroid belt (940 km diameter), provides a unique opportunity to study the interior structure of a volatile-rich dwarf planet. Variations in a planetary body's subsurface rheology and density affect the rate of topographic relaxation. Preferential attenuation of long wavelength topography (>= 150 km) on Ceres suggests that the viscosity of its crust decreases with increasing depth. We present finite element (FE) geodynamical simulations of Ceres to identify the internal structures and compositions that best reproduce its topography as observed by the NASA Dawn mission. We infer that Ceres has a mechanically strong crust with maximum effective viscosity similar to 10(25) Pas. Combined with density constraints, this rheology suggests a crustal composition of carbonates or phyllosilicates, water ice, and at least 30 volume percent (vol.%) low-density, high-strength phases most consistent with salt and/or clathrate hydrates. The inference of these crustal materials supports the past existence of a global ocean, consistent with the observed surface composition. Meanwhile, we infer that the uppermost >= 60 km of the silicate-rich mantle is mechanically weak with viscosity <10(21) Pas, suggesting the presence of liquid pore fluids in this region and a low temperature history that avoided igneous differentiation due to late accretion or efficient heat loss through hydrothermal processes.

Entanglement between more than two hundred macroscopic atomic ensembles in a solid	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							QUANTUM MEMORIES; SINGLE PHOTONS; LIGHT; STATES; REDUCTION; CAVITY; SUPERPOSITION; MECHANICS; STORAGE; MICRO	There are both fundamental and practical motivations for studying whether quantum entanglement can exist in macroscopic systems. However, multiparty entanglement is generally fragile and difficult to quantify. Dicke states are multiparty entangled states where a single excitation is delocalized over many systems. Building on previous work on quantum memories for photons, we create a Dicke state in a solid by storing a single photon in a crystal that contains many large atomic ensembles with distinct resonance frequencies. The photon is re-emitted at a well-defined time due to an interference effect analogous to multi-slit diffraction. We derive a lower bound for the number of entangled ensembles based on the contrast of the interference and the single-photon character of the input, and we experimentally demonstrate entanglement between over two hundred ensembles, each containing a billion atoms. We also illustrate the fact that each individual ensemble contains further entanglement.	[Zarkeshian, P.; Deshmukh, C.; Sinclair, N.; Goyal, S. K.; Aguilar, G. H.; Lefebvre, P.; Puigibert, M.

Influence of El Nino on atmospheric CO2 over the tropical Pacific Ocean: Findings from NASA's OCO-2 mission	SCIENCE			English	Article							EASTERN EQUATORIAL PACIFIC; CARBON-DIOXIDE; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; NATURAL VARIABILITY; DECADAL VARIATIONS; FLUX VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FIRE ACTIVITY	Spaceborne observations of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 are used to characterize the response of tropical atmospheric CO2 concentrations to the strong El Nino event of 2015-2016. Although correlations between the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation are well known, the magnitude of the correlation and the timing of the responses of oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycle remain poorly constrained in space and time. We used space-based CO2 observations to confirm that the tropical Pacific Ocean does play an early and important role in modulating the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during El Nino events-a phenomenon inferred but not previously observed because of insufficient high-density, broad-scale CO2 observations over the tropics.

Launched on 2 July 2014, OCO-2 provides retrievals of the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction (X-CO2) as well as the fluorescence from chlorophyll in terrestrial plants. The seasonal pattern of uptake by the terrestrial biosphere is recorded in fluorescence and the drawdown of X-CO2 during summer. Launched just before one of the most intense El Ninos of the past century, OCO-2 measurements of X-CO2 and fluorescence record the impact of the large change in ocean temperature and rainfall on uptake and release of CO2 by the oceans and biosphere.

Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere exchange, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate anomalies by assimilating column CO2, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and carbon monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Nina, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 +/- 0.34 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse carbon exchange processes. The heterogeneity of the carbon-exchange processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines carbon cycle interannual variability.

OCO-2 transects across the Los Angeles megacity (USA) show that anthropogenic CO2 enhancements peak over the urban core and decrease through suburban areas to rural background values more than similar to 100 kilometers away, varying seasonally from similar to 4.4 to 6.1 parts per million. A transect passing directly downwind of the persistent isolated natural CO2 plume from Yasur volcano (Vanuatu) shows a narrow filament of enhanced CO2 values (similar to 3.4 parts per million), consistent with a CO2 point source emitting 41.6 kilotons per day. These examples highlight the potential of the OCO-2 sensor, with its unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, to detect localized natural and anthropogenic CO2 sources.

OCO-2 advances photosynthesis observation from space via solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence	SCIENCE			English	Article							GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PRODUCTIVITY; MODEL; CYCLE; CO2; PERFORMANCE; MECHANISMS	Quantifying gross primary production (GPP) remains a major challenge in global carbon cycle research. Spaceborne monitoring of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an integrative photosynthetic signal of molecular origin, can assist in terrestrial GPP monitoring. However, the extent to which SIF tracks spatiotemporal variations in GPP remains unresolved. Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)'s SIF data acquisition and fine spatial resolution permit direct validation against ground and airborne observations. Empirical orthogonal function analysis shows consistent spatiotemporal correspondence between OCO-2 SIF and GPP globally. A linear SIF-GPP relationship is also obtained at eddy-flux sites covering diverse biomes, setting the stage for future investigations of the robustness of such a relationship across more biomes. Our findings support the central importance of high-quality satellite SIF for studying terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics.	[Sun, Y.; Frankenberg, C.; Schimel, D. S.; Drewry, D. T.; Magney, T.

J	Raveri, M; Bull, P; Silvestri, A; Pogosian, L				Raveri, Marco; Bull, Philip; Silvestri, Alessandra; Pogosian, Levon			Priors on the effective dark energy equation of state in scalar-tensor theories	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; UNIVERSE; EXPANSION; REDSHIFT	Constraining the dark energy (DE) equation of state, w(DE), is one of the primary science goals of ongoing and future cosmological surveys. In practice, with imperfect data and incomplete redshift coverage, this requires making assumptions about the evolution of wDE with redshift z. These assumptions can be manifested in a choice of a specific parametric form, which can potentially bias the outcome, or else one can reconstruct w(DE)(z) nonparametrically, by specifying a prior covariance matrix that correlates values of wDE at different redshifts. In this work, we derive the theoretical prior covariance for the effective DE equation of state predicted by general scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of motion (Horndeski theories). This is achieved by generating a large ensemble of possible scalar-tensor theories using a Monte Carlo methodology, including the application of physical viability conditions. We also separately consider the special subcase of the minimally coupled scalar field, or quintessence. The prior shows a preference for tracking behaviors in the most general case. Given the covariance matrix, theoretical priors on parameters of any specific parametrization of w(DE)(z) can also be readily derived by projection.

Development toward a ground-based interferometric phased array for radio detection of high energy neutrinos	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Ultra-high energy neutrinos; Radio detection; Phased array	ICE	The in-ice radio interferometric phased array technique for detection of high energy neutrinos looks for Askaryan emission from neutrinos interacting in large volumes of glacial ice, and is being developed as a way to achieve a low energy threshold and a large effective volume at high energies. The technique is based on coherently summing the impulsive Askaryan signal from multiple antennas, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio for weak signals. We report here on measurements and a simulation of thermal noise correlations between nearby antennas, beamforming of impulsive signals, and a measurement of the expected improvement in trigger efficiency through the phased array technique. We also discuss the noise environment observed with an analog phased array at Summit Station, Greenland, a possible site for an interferometric phased array for radio detection of high energy neutrinos.

A Catalog of Stellar Unified Properties (CATSUP) for 951 FGK-Stars within 30 pc	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						catalogs; solar neighborhood; stars: abundances; stars: fundamental parameters; ultraviolet: stars; X-rays: stars	CA-II H; LOWER MAIN-SEQUENCE; LITHIUM ABUNDANCES; EXTRASOLAR PLANETS; PARENT STARS; CHROMOSPHERIC EMISSION; K-EMISSION; F-DWARF; NSTARS PROJECT; COOL STARS	Almost every star in our Galaxy is likely to harbor a terrestrial planet, but accurate measurements of an exoplanet's mass and radius demand accurate knowledge of the properties of its host star. The imminent TESS and CHEOPS missions are slated to discover thousands of new exoplanets. Along with WFIRST, which will directly image nearby planets, these surveys make urgent the need to better characterize stars in the nearby solar neighborhood (< 30 pc). We have compiled the CATalog of Stellar Unified Properties (CATSUP) for 951 stars, including such data as: Gaia astrometry; multiplicity within stellar systems; stellar elemental abundance measurements; standardized spectral types; Ca II H and K stellar activity indices; GALEX NUV and FUV photometry; and X-ray fluxes and luminosities from ROSAT, XMM, and Chandra. We use this data-rich catalog to find correlations, especially between stellar emission indices, colors, and galactic velocity. Additionally, we demonstrate that thick-disk stars in the sample are generally older, have lower activity, and have higher velocities normal to the galactic plane. We anticipate that CATSUP will be useful for discerning other trends among stars within the nearby solar neighborhood, for comparing thin-disk versus thick-disk stars, for comparing stars with and without planets, and for finding correlations between chemical and kinematic properties.

Hydrogen-poor Superluminous Supernovae with Late-time H alpha Emission: Three Events From the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						stars: massive; supernovae: individual (iPTF13ehe, iPTF15esb, iPTF16bad)	PULSATIONAL PAIR-INSTABILITY; LUMINOUS SUPERNOVA; LOW-RESOLUTION; LIGHT CURVES; EVOLUTION; SPECTROGRAPH; DISCOVERY; SN-2006GY; SPECTRA	We present observations of two new hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I), iPTF15esb and iPTF16bad, showing late-time H alpha emission with line luminosities of (1-3) x 10(41) erg s(-1) and velocity widths of (4000-6000) km s(-1). Including the previously published iPTF13ehe, this makes up a total of three such events to date. iPTF13ehe is one of the most luminous and the slowest evolving SLSNe-I, whereas the other two are less luminous and fast decliners. We interpret this as a result of the ejecta running into a neutral H-shell located at a radius of similar to 10(16) cm. This implies that violent mass loss must have occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short time interval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly before core collapse, and more importantly helium is unlikely to be completely stripped off the progenitor and could be present in the ejecta. It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even though nonthermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He, may exist as suggested by the O II absorption series in the early-time spectra. Our late-time spectra (+240 days) appear to have intrinsically lower [O I] 6300 angstrom luminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, which is possibly an indication of less oxygen (<10 M-circle dot). The blueshifted H alpha emission relative to the hosts for all three events may be in tension with the binary model proposed for iPTF13ehe. Finally, iPTF15esb has a peculiar light curve (LC) with three peaks separated from one another by similar to 22 days. The LC undulation is stronger in bluer bands. One possible explanation is ejecta-circumstellar medium interaction.	[Yan, Lin; Masci, F.] CALTECH, IPAC, MS100-22, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Yan, Lin; Kulkarni, S.

To this end, we add CO2 to a N-2: CH4 gas mixture used in a plasma typically used for Titan studies. We produce organic thin films (tholins) in plasmas where the CO2/CH4 ratio is increased from 0 to 4. We measure these films via spectrometric ellipsometry and apply a Tauc-Lorentz model, used for optically transparent materials, to obtain the thickness of the thin film, its optical band gap, and the refractive indices in the UV-visible (270-600 nm). All samples present a significant absorption band in the UV. According to the TaucLorentz model, as the CO2/CH4 ratio is quadrupled, the position of the UV band is shifted from similar to 177 nm to 264 nm while its strength is quadrupled. Consequently, we infer that oxidized organic aerosols absorb more efficiently at longer UV wavelengths than reduced aerosols. Our laboratory wavelength-tabulated UV-vis refractive indices provide new constraints to atmospheric models of the early Earth and Earth-like exoplanets including photochemical hazes formed under increasingly oxidizing conditions.

Quantifying the source contributions to PM2.5 concentrations has been a challenging task because of the complicated non-linear relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and emissions of multiple pollutants from multiple spatial regions and economic sectors. In this study, we use the Extended Response Surface Modeling (ERSM) technique to investigate the nonlinear response of PM2.5 and its major chemical components to emissions of multiple pollutants from different regions and sectors over the BTH region, based on over 1000 simulations by a chemical transport model (CTM). The ERSM-predicted PM2.5 concentrations agree well with independent CTM simulations, with correlation coefficients larger than 0.99 and mean normalized errors less than 1 %. Using the ERSM technique, we find that primary inorganic PM2.5 is the single pollutant which makes the largest contribution (24-36 %) to PM2.5 concentrations. The contribution of primary inorganic PM2.5 emissions is especially high in heavily polluted winter, and is dominated by the industry as well as residential and commercial sectors, which should be prioritized in PM2.5 control strategies. The total contributions of all precursors (nitrogen oxides, NOx; sulfur dioxides, SO2; ammonia, NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOC; intermediate-volatility organic compounds, IVOC; primary organic aerosol, POA) to PM2.5 concentrations range between 31 % and 48 %. Among these precursors, PM2.5 concentrations are primarily sensitive to the emissions of NH3, NMVOC + IVOC, and POA. The sensitivities increase substantially for NH3 and NOx, and decrease slightly for POA and NMVOC + IVOC with the increase in the emission reduction ratio, which illustrates the nonlinear relationships between precursor emissions and PM2.5 concentrations. The contributions of primary inorganic PM2.5 emissions to PM2.5 concentrations are dominated by local emission sources, which account for over 75 % of the total primary inorganic PM2.5 contributions. For precursors, however, emissions from other regions could play similar roles to local emission sources in the summer and over the northern part of BTH. The source contribution features for various types of heavy-pollution episodes are distinctly different from each other and from the monthly mean results, illustrating that control strategies should be differentiated based on the major contributing sources during different types of episodes.

Color Me Intrigued: The Discovery of iPTF 16fnm, an SN 2002cx-like Object	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational; surveys; supernovae: general; supernovae: individual (SN 2002cx, SN 2005hk, iPTF 16fnm)	CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVA; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; IA SUPERNOVAE; LOW-LUMINOSITY; LOW-RESOLUTION; EXPLOSION; TRANSIENT; ENERGY; CONSTRAINTS; PROGENITOR	0 Modern wide-field, optical time-domain surveys must solve a basic optimization problem: maximize the number of transient discoveries or minimize the follow-up needed for the new discoveries. Here, we describe the Color Me Intrigued experiment, the first from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) to search for transients simultaneously in the g(PTF') and R-PTF bands. During the course of this experiment, we discovered iPTF 16fnm, a new member of the 02cx-like subclass of Type Ia supernovae (SNe). iPTF 16fnm peaked at Mg-PTF = -15.09 +/- 0.17 mag, making it the second-least-luminous known SN Ia. iPTF 16fnm exhibits all the hallmarks of the 02cx-like class: (i) low luminosity at peak, (ii) low ejecta velocities, and (iii) a non-nebular spectrum several months after peak. Spectroscopically, iPTF 16fnm exhibits a striking resemblance to two other low-luminosity 02cx-like SNe: SN. 2007qd and SN 2010ae. iPTF 16fnm and SN 2005hk decline at nearly the same rate, despite a 3 mag difference in brightness at peak. When considering the full subclass of 02cx-like SNe, we do not find evidence for a tight correlation between peak luminosity and decline rate in either the g ' or r ' band. We measure the relative rate of 02cx-like SNe to normal SNe Ia and find r(N02cx/NIa) = 33(-25)(+158)%. We further examine the g ' - r ' evolution of 02cx-like SNe and find that their unique color evolution can be used to separate them from 91bg-like and normal SNe Ia. This selection function will be especially important in the spectroscopically incomplete Zwicky Transient Facility/Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) era. Finally, we close by recommending that LSST periodically evaluate, and possibly update, its observing cadence to maximize transient science.	[Miller, A.

The dark matter is assumed to exist in the form of waves of ultralight scalar fields or in the form of topological defects (monopoles and strings). We identify dark matter signal signatures in clock Allan deviation plots that can be used to constrain the dark matter coupling to the Standard Model fields. The existing data on the Al+/Hg+ clock comparison are used to put new limits on the dilaton dark matter in the region of masses m(phi) > 10(-15) eV. We also estimate the sensitivities of future atomic clock experiments in space, including the cesium microwave and strontium optical clocks aboard the International Space Station, as well as a potential nuclear clock. These experiments are expected to put new limits on the topological dark matter in the range of masses 10(-10) eV < m(phi) < 10(-6) eV.

For example, increases in melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and reductions in sea ice and permafrost distribution are likely to alter coastal morphodynamics. The deltas of Greenland are largely unaffected by human activity, but increased freshwater runoff and sediment fluxes may increase the size of the deltas, whereas increased wave activity in ice-free periods could reduce their size, with the net impact being unclear until now. Here we show that southwestern Greenland deltas were largely stable from the 1940s to 1980s, but prograded (that is, sediment deposition extended the delta into the sea) in a warming Arctic from the 1980s to 2010s. Our results are based on the areal changes of 121 deltas since the 1940s, assessed using newly discovered aerial photographs and remotely sensed imagery. We find that delta progradation was driven by high freshwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet coinciding with periods of open water. Progradation was controlled by the local initial environmental conditions (that is, accumulated air temperatures above 0 degrees C per year, freshwater runoff and sea ice in the 1980s) rather than by local changes in these conditions from the 1980s to 2010s at each delta. This is in contrast to a dominantly eroding trend of Arctic sedimentary coasts along the coastal plains of Alaska(2), Siberia(3) and western Canada(4), and to the spatially variable patterns of erosion and accretion along the large deltas of the main rivers in the Arctic5-7. Our results improve the understanding of Arctic coastal evolution in a changing climate, and reveal the impacts on coastal areas of increasing ice mass loss and the associated freshwater runoff and lengthening of open-water periods.

Global and Brazilian Carbon Response to El Nino Modoki 2011 - 2010	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTROMETER; GASES OBSERVING SATELLITE; CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; FIRE EMISSIONS; GREENHOUSE GASES; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY	The El Nino Modoki in 2010 led to historic droughts in Brazil. In order to understand its impact on carbon cycle variability, we derive the 2011 - 2010 annual carbon flux change (delta F-up arrow) globally and specifically to Brazil using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) framework. Satellite observations of CO2, CO, and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) are ingested into a 4D-variational assimilation system driven by carbon cycle models to infer spatially resolved carbon fluxes including net ecosystem production, biomass burning, and gross primary productivity (GPP). The global 2011 - 2010 net carbon flux change was estimated to be delta F-up arrow = -1.60 PgC, while the Brazilian carbon flux change was -0.24 +/- 0.11 PgC. This estimate is broadly within the uncertainty of previous aircraft-based estimates restricted to the Amazon basin. The 2011-2010 biomass burning change in Brazil was -0.24 +/- 0.036 PgC, which implies a near-zero 2011-2010 change of the net ecosystem production (NEP): The near-zero NEP change is the result of quantitatively comparable increases GPP (0.31 +/- 0.20 PgC) and respiration in 2011. Comparisons between Brazilian and global component carbon flux changes reveal complex interactions between the processes controlling annual land-atmosphere CO2 exchanges. These results show the potential of multiple satellite observations to help quantify and spatially resolve the response of productivity and respiration fluxes to climate variability.	[Bowman, K.

Revisiting Ionosphere-Thermosphere Responses to Solar Wind Driving in Superstorms of November 2003 and 2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							ULTRAVIOLET IMAGER GUVI; ST PATRICKS DAY; MAGNETIC CLOUDS; INTERPLANETARY ORIGINS; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; STORMS; O/N-2; INDEX; TIMED/GUVI; DYNAMICS	We revisit three complex superstorms of 19-20 November 2003, 7-8 November 2004, and 9-11 November 2004 to analyze ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) effects driven by different solar wind structures associated with complex interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their upstream sheaths. The efficiency of the solar wind-magnetosphere connection throughout the storms is estimated by coupling functions. The daytime IT responses to the complex driving are characterized by combining and collocating (where possible) measurements of several physical parameters (total electron content or TEC, thermospheric infrared nitric oxide emission, and composition ratio) from multiple satellite platforms and ground-based measurements. A variety of metrics are utilized to examine global IT phenomena at similar to 1 h timescales. The role of direct driving of IT dynamics by solar wind structures and the role of IT preconditioning in these storms, which feature complex unusual TEC responses, are examined and contrasted. Furthermore, IT responses to ICME magnetic clouds and upstream sheaths are separately characterized. We identify IT feedback effects that can be important for long-lasting strong storms. The role of the interplanetary magnetic field By component on ionospheric convection may not be well captured by existing coupling functions. Mechanisms of thermospheric overdamping and consequential ionospheric feedback need to be further studied.	[Verkhoglyadova, O. P.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Mlynczak, M.

J	Suzuki, K; Stephens, GL; Golaz, JC				Suzuki, Kentaroh; Stephens, Graeme L.; Golaz, Jean-Christophe			Significance of aerosol radiative effect in energy balance control on global precipitation change	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						global energy balance; aerosol radiative effect; cloud microphysics; hydrologic sensitivity	HYDROLOGIC-CYCLE; CLIMATE MODEL; SENSITIVITY; CONSTRAINT	Historical changes of global precipitation in the 20th century simulated by a climate model are investigated. The results simulated with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics are analyzed in the context of energy balance controls on global precipitation, where the latent heat changes associated with the precipitation change is nearly balanced with changes to atmospheric radiative cooling. The atmospheric radiative cooling is dominated by its clear-sky component, which is found to correlate with changes to both column water vapor and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The water vapor-dependent component of the clear-sky radiative cooling is then found to scale with global temperature change through the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. This component results in a tendency of global precipitation increase with increasing temperature at a rate of approximately 2% K-1. Another component of the clear-sky radiative cooling, which is well correlated with changes to AOD, is also found to vary in magnitude among different scenarios with alternate configurations of cloud microphysics that controls the precipitation efficiency, a major factor influencing the aerosol scavenging process that can lead to different aerosol loadings. These results propose how different characteristics of cloud microphysics can cause different aerosol loadings that in turn perturb global energy balance to significantly change global precipitation. This implies a possible coupling of aerosol-cloud interaction with aerosol-radiation interaction in the context of global energy balance.

J	Miller, MM; Shirzaei, M; Argus, D				Miller, Megan Marie; Shirzaei, Manoochehr; Argus, Donald			Aquifer Mechanical Properties and Decelerated Compaction in Tucson, Arizona	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						InSAR; subsidence; recharge; storage; compaction	SAN-LUIS VALLEY; LAND SUBSIDENCE; GROUND SUBSIDENCE; LAS-VEGAS; INSAR; STORAGE; SYSTEM; WATER; COLORADO; CALIFORNIA	In recent decades, high groundwater extraction rates, often coincident with periods of severe drought, result in the widespread decline of water levels. Overexploitation of aquifers also causes land subsidence, which poses a severe threat to infrastructure. Tucson, Arizona experiences land subsidence coupled with the depletion of groundwater, a critical water resource for the desert city. To understand the spatiotemporal evolution of land subsidence and its implications for aquifer properties, we examine long time series of surface deformation and head levels. Measurements at extensometer stations indicate rapid compaction of fine-grained material up to 8.5mm/yr from 1990 to 2005, which results in permanent storage volume losses up to 4.1%. The analysis of densely populated sets of interferograms generated from Envisat and RadarSAT C band acquisitions yields multitemporal maps of surface deformation at unprecedented resolution. These maps reveal that subsidence significantly slows by the late 2000s, corresponding with the implementation of artificial recharge efforts. Subsequent to groundwater level recovery, we observe a brief 6.6year interval of residual compaction, suggesting a high vertical hydraulic conductivity, which is then shown to be up to 9.8 x 10(-4)m/d. We also estimate the average elastic and inelastic skeletal storage coefficients for the aquifer system to be 3.78 x10(-3) and 6.01 x 10(-3), respectively. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar shows deformation nearly ceases by 2015, likely reducing hazards associated with Earth fissuring and infrastructure damage. This study highlights successful outcomes of water management and conservation plans that preserve existing groundwater reserves and increase artificial recharge.

Determined through a Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother assimilating position observations, Earth orientation parameters, and local ties, JTRF2014 is a subsecular, time series-based TRF whose origin is at the quasi-instantaneous center of mass (CM) as sensed by SLR and whose scale is determined by the quasi-instantaneous VLBI and SLR scales. The dynamical evolution of the positions accounts for a secular motion term, annual, and semiannual periodic modes. Site-dependent variances based on the analysis of loading displacements induced by mass redistributions of terrestrial fluids have been used to control the extent of random walk adopted in the combination. With differences in the amplitude of the annual signal within the range 0.5-0.8mm, JTRF2014-derived center of network-to-center of mass (CM-CN) is in remarkable agreement with the geocenter motion obtained via spectral inversion of GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations and modeled ocean bottom pressure from Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). Comparisons of JTRF2014 to ITRF2014 suggest high-level consistency with time derivatives of the Helmert transformation parameters connecting the two frames below 0.18mm/yr and weighted root-mean-square differences of the polar motion (polar motion rate) in the order of 30as (17as/d).

While interferometric synthetic aperture radar has been used to study hydrological deformation, its limited temporal sampling can lead to biases in rapidly changing systems. Here we use 2011-2017 COSMO-SkyMed data with revisit intervals as short as 1day to study the response of the Santa Clara Valley (SCV) aquifer in California to the unprecedented 2012-2015 drought. Cross-correlation and independent component analyses of deformation time series enable tracking water through the aquifer system. The aquifer properties are derived prior to and during the drought to assess the success of water-resource management practices. Subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal dominates during 2011-2017, limited to the confined aquifer and west of the Silver Creek Fault, similar to predrought summer periods. Minimum water levels and elevations were reached in mid-2014, but thanks to intensive groundwater management efforts the basin started to rebound in late 2014, during the deepening drought. By 2017, water levels were back to their predrought levels, while elevations had not yet fully rebounded due to the delayed poroelastic response of aquitards and their large elastic compressibility. As water levels did not reach a new lowstand, the drought led to only elastic and recoverable changes in the SCV. The SCV lost 0.09km(3) during the drought while seasonal variations amount to 0.02km(3). Analysis of surface loads due to water mass changes in the aquifer system suggests that groundwater drawdowns could influence the stress on nearby faults.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) retarder optics. The DKIST retarder baseline design used six crystals, single-layer antireflection coatings, thick cover windows, and oil between all optical interfaces. This tool estimates polarization fringes and optic Mueller matrices as functions of all optical design choices. The amplitude and period of polarized fringes under design changes, manufacturing errors, tolerances, and several physical factors can now be estimated. This tool compares well with observations of fringes for data collected with the spectropolarimeter for infrared and optical regions at the Dunn Solar Telescope using bicrystalline achromatic retarders as well as laboratory tests. With this tool, we show impacts of design decisions on polarization fringes as impacted by antireflection coatings, oil refractive indices, cover window presence, and part thicknesses. This tool helped DKIST decide to remove retarder cover windows and also recommends reconsideration of coating strategies for DKIST. We anticipate this tool to be essential in designing future retarders for mitigation of polarization and intensity fringe errors in other high spectral resolution astronomical systems.

To prepare for the deployment of EFC using ground-based telescopes, we investigate the response of EFC to unaccounted for deviations from an ideal optical model. We explore the linear nature of the algorithm by assessing its response to a range of inaccuracies in the optical model generally present in real systems. We find that the algorithm is particularly sensitive to unresponsive deformable mirror (DM) actuators, misalignment of the Lyot stop, and misalignment of the focal plane mask. Vibrations and DM registration appear to be less of a concern compared to values expected at the telescope. We quantify how accurately one must model these core coronagraph components to ensure successful EFC corrections. We conclude that while the condition of the DM can limit contrast, EFC may still be used to improve the sensitivity of high-contrast imaging observations. Our results have informed the development of a full EFC implementation using the Project 1640 coronagraph at Palomar observatory. While focused on a specific instrument, our results are applicable to the many coronagraphs that may be interested in employing EFC.

This paper summarizes the authors' efforts on the development of a model performance metric and its application to assess summer precipitation over the U.S. Great Plains (USGP) in these downscaled climate simulations. Anew model performance metric T was first developed that uses both the linear correlation coefficient and mean square error and is consistent with other commonly used metrics, but gives a bigger separation between good and bad simulations. This metric T was then applied to the summer mean precipitation spatial pattern, diurnal Hovmoller diagram, and diurnal spatial pattern over the USGP from the simulations focusing on the summer precipitation diurnal cycle related to mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). The metric T skill scores increase significantly from the control simulation to the nudged simulations and from the nudged simulations with shorter wavelengths to the nudged simulations with longer wavelengths, but do not change much from MERRA-2 to the downscaled simulations or between the various downscaled simulations with different spatial resolutions. Thus, there is some credibility, but no significant value added compared to MERRA-2, of the downscaled climate simulations of the summer precipitation over the USGP.

Precision of Ku-Band Reflected Signals of Opportunity Altimetry	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Bistatic radar; coastal altimetry; oceanography; signals of opportunity (SoOps)	OCEAN ALTIMETRY; SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; SEA-SURFACE; GPS SIGNALS; PARIS; TOPEX/POSEIDON; TOPOGRAPHY; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	This letter provides a proof-of-concept experiment and validation of an error model for bistatic altimetry using signals of opportunity (SoOps). Coastal sea surface height plays a prominent role in measuring the total water-level envelope directly and is one of the key quantities required by storm surge applications and services. Nadir satellite altimeters have a long history of mapping the variability of the earth's open ocean. However, they exhibit problems operating in coastal areas due to the effects, such as land contamination, rapid variations due to tides, and atmospheric effects. One technique for filling this gap is bistatic altimetry using SoOp (e.g., digital communication signal reflections). In this letter, we investigate capabilities of this technique. Twenty three days of data were collected at platform harvest from a single channel of the Ku-Band direct broadcast satellite. The wind speed observed during the experiment was between 4 and 14 m/s and significant wave height was between 0.7 and 4 m as measured by buoy 46 218 located 8 km away. The standard deviation in the estimation of height was found to be 7.2 cm (the same as predicted from theory). Using a least-squares approach improved the precision reducing the standard deviation to 6.8 cm. It is shown that the error in the estimation of height can be reduced to 3.5 cm by utilizing the full bandwidth (all the channels) of the SoOp. Extrapolating these results, we predict a precision of 5.3 cm from a typical (e.g., Jason) orbit of 1380 km.

Displacements are parameterized in time with a dictionary of displacement functions. The algorithm extends an earlier single-component (i.e., single line of sight) framework for time-series analysis to three spatial dimensions using combinations of multitemporal, multigeometry interferometic synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and/or pixel offset (PO) maps. We demonstrate this method with a set of 101 pairs of azimuth and range PO maps generated for a portion of the Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, derived from data collected by the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation. We compare our results with previously published InSAR mean velocity fields and selected GPS time series and show that our resulting three-component surface displacements resolve both secular motion and tidal variability.

More recently, it has been used to detect shallow aquifers in warm, dry, and desert regions. At Mars, a long-wavelength radar sounding from low orbit altitudes has produced global maps that reveal the presence of ice layering at all latitudes and glacial deposits on the flanks of volcanoes. Until now, sounding from the earth orbit at wavelengths long enough to penetrate ice sheets and arid sand was thought to be infeasible, because of the electromagnetic properties of the ionosphere. In this paper, we show that a radar sounding at frequencies as low as 45 MHz is, in fact, theoretically possible under viewing conditions that occur often enough to be practical. This conclusion opens up a previously unutilized portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for large-scale, spaceborne remote sensing of subsurface features on the earth.

J	Fattahi, H; Simons, M; Agram, P				Fattahi, Heresh; Simons, Mark; Agram, Piyush			InSAR Time-Series Estimation of the Ionospheric Phase Delay: An Extension of the Split Range-Spectrum Technique	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); ionospheric phase delay; split range-spectrum	SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; SURFACE DEFORMATION; FARADAY-ROTATION; UNCERTAINTY; ALGORITHM; TOPS	Repeat pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations may be significantly impacted by the propagation delay of the microwave signal through the ionosphere, which is commonly referred to as ionospheric delay. The dispersive character of the ionosphere at microwave frequencies allows one to estimate the ionospheric delay from InSAR data through a split range-spectrum technique. Here, we extend the existing split range-spectrum technique to InSAR time-series. We present an algorithm for estimating a time-series of ionospheric phase delay that is useful for correcting InSAR time-series of ground surface displacement or for evaluating the spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC). Experimental results from stacks of L-band SAR data acquired by the ALOS-1 Japanese satellite show significant ionospheric phase delay equivalent to 2 m of the temporal variation of InSAR time-series along 445 km in Chile, a region at low latitudes where large TEC variations are common. The observed delay is significantly smaller, with a maximum of 10 cm over 160 km, in California. The estimation and correction of ionospheric delay reduces the temporal variation of the InSAR time-series to centimeter levels in Chile. The ionospheric delay correction of the InSAR time-series reveals earthquake-induced ground displacement, which otherwise could not be detected. A comparison with independent GPS time-series demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in the root mean square difference between GPS and InSAR after correcting for ionospheric delay. The results show that the presented algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of InSAR time-series and should become a routine component of InSAR time-series analysis.

Frequency-horizontal wavenumber SSH spectral densities are computed over seven regions of the world ocean from two simulations of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and three simulations of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). High wavenumber, high-frequency SSH variance follows the predicted IGW linear dispersion curves. The realism of high-frequency motions (> 0.87cpd) in the models is tested through comparison of the frequency spectral density of dynamic height variance computed from the highest-resolution runs of each model (1/25 degrees HYCOM and 1/48 degrees MITgcm) with dynamic height variance frequency spectral density computed from nine in situ profiling instruments. These high-frequency motions are of particular interest because of their contributions to the small-scale SSH variability that will be observed on a global scale in the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimetry mission. The variance at supertidal frequencies can be comparable to the tidal and low-frequency variance for high wavenumbers (length scales smaller than approximate to 50 km), especially in the higher-resolution simulations. In the highest-resolution simulations, the high-frequency variance can be greater than the low-frequency variance at these scales.

Relating geologic units and mobility system kinematics contributing to Curiosity wheel damage at Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Americas Regional Conference on International-Society-for-Terrain-Vehicle-Systems	SEP 12-14, 2016	Detroit, MI	Int Soc Terrain Vehicle Syst		Mars rovers; Curiosity rover; Ackerman arcs		Curiosity landed on plains to the north of Mount Sharp in August 2012. By June 2016 the rover had traversed 12.9 km to the southwest, encountering extensive strata that were deposited in a fluvial-deltaic-lacustrine system. Initial drives across sharp sandstone outcrops initiated an unacceptably high rate of punctures and cracks in the thin aluminum wheel skin structures. Initial damage was found to be related to the drive control mode of the six wheel drive actuators and the kinematics of the rocker-bogie suspension. Wheels leading a suspension pivot were forced onto sharp, immobile surfaces by the other wheels as they maintained their commanded angular velocities. Wheel damage mechanisms such as geometry-induced stress concentration cracking and low-cycle fatigue were then exacerbated. A geomorphic map was generated to assist in planning traverses that would minimize further wheel damage. A steady increase in punctures and cracks between landing and June 2016 was due in part because of drives across the sharp sandstone outcrops that could not be avoided. Wheel lifetime estimates show that with careful path planning the wheels will be operational for an additional ten kilometers or more, allowing the rover to reach key strata exposed on the slopes of Mount Sharp.

Laboratory Investigations on the Survival of Bacillus subtilis Spores in Deliquescent Salt Mars Analog Environments	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Raman microscopy; Mars; Planetary protection; Salts; Water activity.	AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; LANDING SITE; GALE CRATER; PERCHLORATE; IDENTIFICATION; GERMINATION; DEPOSITION; MODEL; ACID	Observed features such as recurring slope lineae suggest that liquid water may exist on the surface and near-subsurface of Mars today. The presence of this liquid water, likely in the form of a brine, has important implications for the present-day water cycle, habitability, and planetary protection policies. It is possible that this water is formed, at least partially, by deliquescence of salts, a process during which hygroscopic salts absorb water vapor from the atmosphere and form a saturated liquid brine. We performed laboratory experiments to examine the ability of Bacillus subtilis (B-168) spores, alone or mixed with calcium perchlorate salt (Ca(ClO4)(2)), to form liquid water via deliquescence under Mars-relevant conditions. Spore survival after exposure to these conditions was examined. An environmental chamber was used to expose the samples to temperature and relative humidity (RH) values similar to those found on Mars, and Raman microscopy was used to identify the phases of water and salt that were present and to confirm the presence of spores. We found that B-168 spores did not condense any detectable water vapor on their own during the diurnal cycle, even at 100% RH. However, when spores were mixed with perchlorate salt, the entire sample deliquesced at low RH values, immersing the spores in a brine solution during the majority of the simulated martian temperature and humidity cycle. After exposure to the simulated diurnal cycles and, in some cases, perchlorate brine, the impact of each environmental scenario on spore survival was estimated by standard plate assay. We found that, if there are deliquescent salts in contact with spores, there is a mechanism for the spores to acquire liquid water starting with only atmospheric water vapor as the H2O source. Also, neither crystalline nor liquid Ca(ClO4)(2) is sporicidal despite the low water activity. Key Words: Raman microscopyMarsPlanetary protectionSaltsWater activity. Astrobiology 17, 997-1008.

ENVIRONMENTAL-SAMPLES; AGRICULTURAL FIELD; QUANTITATIVE PCR; MARS; HABITABILITY; INSTRUMENT; ERUPTION; ICELAND; PRIMERS; VOLCANO	We conducted an analog sampling expedition under simulated mission constraints to areas dominated by basaltic tephra of the Eldfell and Fimmvorouhals lava fields (Iceland). Sites were selected to be homogeneous at a coarse remote sensing resolution (10-100m) in apparent color, morphology, moisture, and grain size, with best-effort realism in numbers of locations and replicates. Three different biomarker assays (counting of nucleic-acid-stained cells via fluorescent microscopy, a luciferin/luciferase assay for adenosine triphosphate, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect DNA associated with bacteria, archaea, and fungi) were characterized at four nested spatial scales (1m, 10m, 100m, and >1km) by using five common metrics for sample site representativeness (sample mean variance, group F tests, pairwise t tests, and the distribution-free rank sum H and u tests). Correlations between all assays were characterized with Spearman's rank test. The bioluminescence assay showed the most variance across the sites, followed by qPCR for bacterial and archaeal DNA; these results could not be considered representative at the finest resolution tested (1m). Cell concentration and fungal DNA also had significant local variation, but they were homogeneous over scales of >1km. These results show that the selection of life detection assays and the number, distribution, and location of sampling sites in a low biomass environment with limited a priori characterization can yield both contrasting and complementary results, and that their interdependence must be given due consideration to maximize science return in future biomarker sampling expeditions.

NEOWISE Reactivation Mission Year Three: Asteroid Diameters and Albedos	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets; asteroids: general	ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDES; INVERSION; ARECIBO; OBJECTS; MODEL	The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) reactivation mission has completed its third year of surveying the sky in the thermal infrared for near-Earth asteroids and comets. NEOWISE collects simultaneous observations at 3.4 and 4.6. mu m of solar system objects passing through its field of regard. These data allow for the determination of total thermal emission from bodies in the inner solar system, and thus the sizes of these objects. In this paper, we present thermal model fits of asteroid diameters for 170 NEOs and 6110 Main Belt asteroids (MBAs) detected during the third year of the survey, as well as the associated optical geometric albedos. We compare our results with previous thermal model results from NEOWISE for overlapping sample sets, as well as diameters determined through other independent methods, and find that our diameter measurements for NEOs agree to within 26% (1 sigma) of previously measured values. Diameters for the MBAs are within 17% (1 sigma). This brings the total number of unique near-Earth objects characterized by the NEOWISE survey to 541, surpassing the number observed during the fully cryogenic mission in 2010.

THE OLYMPIC MOUNTAINS EXPERIMENT (OLYMPEX)	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							MESOSCALE RAINBANDS; RADAR OBSERVATIONS; PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION; STORMS; FLOW	The Olympic Mountains Experiment (OLYMPEX) took place during the 2015/16 fall-winter season in the vicinity of the mountainous Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. The goals of OLYMPEX were to provide physical and hydrologic ground validation for the U.S.-Japan Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite mission and, more specifically, to study how precipitation in Pacific frontal systems is modified by passage over coastal mountains. Four transportable scanning dual-polarization Doppler radars of various wavelengths were installed. Surface stations were placed at various altitudes to measure precipitation rates, particle size distributions, and fall velocities. Autonomous recording cameras monitored and recorded snow accumulation. Four research aircraft supplied by NASA investigated precipitation processes and snow cover, and supplemental rawinsondes and dropsondes were deployed during precipitation events. Numerous Pacific frontal systems were sampled, including several reaching atmospheric river status, warm- and cold-frontal systems, and postfrontal convection.

Although difficult to access and sample, deep subsurface environments have been probed through drilling programs, exploration of mines and sampling of deeply sourced vents and springs. In an effort to understand the ecology of deep terrestrial habitats, we examined bacterial diversity in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), the former Homestake gold mine, in South Dakota, USA. Whole genomic DNA was extracted from deeply circulating groundwater and corresponding host rock (at a depth of 1.45 km below ground surface). Pyrotag DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed diverse communities of putative chemolithoautotrophs, aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs, numerous candidate phyla and unique rock-associated microbial assemblage. There was a clear and near-total separation of communities between SURF deeply circulating fracture fluids and SURF host-rocks. Sequencing data from SURF compared against five similarly sequenced terrestrial subsurface sites in Europe and North America revealed classes Clostridia and Betaproteobacteria were dominant in terrestrial fluids. This study presents a unique analysis showing differences in terrestrial subsurface microbial communities between fracture fluids and host rock through which those fluids permeate.

Although a large number of variables can affect bearing thermal conductance, the review and survey of 353 data points from previous studies indicates that a reasonable relationship between the bearing size and thermal conductance exists. Correlations of bearing conductance as a function of the bearing outside diameter were developed for dry, marginally lubricated, and flooded bearings in vacuum. The correlation for dry bearings is a less accurate, but more convenient, order-of-magnitude estimate than the analytical expressions widely available in the literature for dry bearings. However, the marginally lubricated and flooded correlations have R-squared values of 0.87 and 0.89, and 95% of the data points for these bearings fall within 50% of the value given by the proposed correlations. This work is of practical use to engineers who seek to estimate the static bearing thermal conductance in vacuum and atmospheric environments.

Methane bursts as a trigger for intermittent lake-forming climates on post-Noachian Mars	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							GALE CRATER; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; SEDIMENTARY-ROCKS; CLAY-MINERALS; ANCIENT; MODEL; GREENHOUSE; OBLIQUITY; EVOLUTION; OLIVINE	Lakes existed on Mars later than 3.6 billion years ago, according to sedimentary evidence for deltaic deposition. The observed fluviolacustrine deposits suggest that individual lake-forming climates persisted for at least several thousand years (assuming dilute flow). But the lake watersheds' little-weathered soils indicate a largely dry climate history, with intermittent runoff events. Here we show that these observational constraints, although inconsistent with many previously proposed triggers for lake-forming climates, are consistent with a methane burst scenario. In this scenario, chaotic transitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice loading that destabilize methane clathrate. Using numerical simulations, we find that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for lake-forming climates, if methane clathrate initially occupies more than 4% of the total volume in which it is thermodynamically stable. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with methane production by water-rock reactions due to hydrothermal circulation on early Mars. We further estimate that photochemical destruction of atmospheric methane curtails the duration of individual lake-forming climates to less than a million years, consistent with observations. We conclude that methane bursts represent a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet climate state on early Mars.

We present a novel probabilistic approach to jointly estimate the seafloor reflectance and water properties while flexibly incorporating varied domain knowledge and in situ measurements. The inversion transforms remote radiance data with an atmospheric correction followed by a water column correction. Benthic reflectance and water optical properties are both represented by linear mixtures of endmember spectra. We combine remote measurements, prior knowledge and field data using a flexible Bayesian optimal estimation, solving for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) combination of water column properties, seafloor reflectance, and depth. We then demonstrate performance in controlled simulations and in overflights of a coral reef in Hawaii with coincident in situ measurements. The measurement approach helps lay a foundation for wide-area airborne mapping of the condition of threatened coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs.

A multi-scale high-resolution analysis of global sea surface temperature	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Multi-sensor; Multi-scale; Wavelet	WEST-COAST; SATELLITE; FIELDS; OCEAN; ATMOSPHERE; IMPACT; INTERPOLATION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHMS; ONDELETTES	The Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR) sea surface temperature (SST) analysis presents daily SST estimates on a global 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees grid. The current version (Version 4.1, http://dx.doi.org/10.5067/GHGMR-4FJ04) features the 1-km resolution MODIS retrievals, which are fused with AVHRR GAC, microwave, and in-situ SST data by applying internal correction for relative biases among the data sets. Only the night-time (dusk to dawn locally) satellite SST retrievals are used to estimate the foundation SST. The MUR SST values agree with the GHRSST Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE) SST field to 0.36 degrees C on average, except in summer-time Arctic region where the existing SST analysis products are known to disagree with each other. The feature resolution of the MUR SST analysis is an order of magnitude higher than most existing analysis products. The Multi-Resolution Variational Analysis (MRVA) method allows the MUR analysis to use multiple synoptic time scales, including a 5-day data window used for reconstruction of mesoscale features and data windows of only few hours for the smaller scale features. Reconstruction of fast evolving small scale features and interpolation over persistent large data voids can be achieved simultaneously by the use of multiple synoptic windows in the multi-scale setting. The MRVA method is also a "mesh-less" interpolation procedure that avoids truncation of the geolocation data during gridding and binning of satellite samples. Future improvements of the MUR SST analysis will include ingestion of day-time MODIS retrievals as well as more recent high-resolution SST retrievals from VIIRS.

SMAP SSS achieved an accuracy of 0.2 PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In the tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1 m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from the assessment of the satellite data. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis gives an average standard deviation of 0.22 PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale. On monthly time scales, the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17 PSU and the correlation coefficient improved to 0.8. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusions from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from Argo floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG. Comparison with individual Argo floats suggests the SMAP retrieval algorithm performs better in the Western Mediterranean region, but suffers from radio-frequency interference (RFI) and land contamination in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Adriatic Sea.

Identification of the Beagle 2 lander on Mars	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article						Beagle 2; Mars; HiRISE	SYSTEM	The 2003 Beagle 2 Mars lander has been identified in Isidis Planitia at 90.43 degrees E, 11.53 degrees N, close to the predicted target of 90.50 degrees E, 11.53 degrees N. Beagle 2 was an exobiology lander designed to look for isotopic and compositional signs of life on Mars, as part of the European Space Agency Mars Express (MEX) mission. The 2004 recalculation of the original landing ellipse from a 3-sigma major axis from 174km to 57 km, and the acquisition of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) imagery at 30 cm per pixel across the target region, led to the initial identification of the lander in 2014. Following this, more HiRISE images, giving a total of 15, including red and blue-green colours, were obtained over the area of interest and searched, which allowed sub-pixel imaging using super high-resolution techniques. The size (approx. 1.5 m), distinctive multilobed shape, high reflectivity relative to the local terrain, specular reflections, and location close to the centre of the planned landing ellipse led to the identification of the Beagle 2 lander. The shape of the imaged lander, although to some extent masked by the specular reflections in the various images, is consistent with deployment of the lander lid and then some or all solar panels. Failure to fully deploy the panels-which may have been caused by damage during landing-would have prohibited communication between the lander and MEX and commencement of science operations. This implies that the main part of the entry, descent and landing sequence, the ejection from MEX, atmospheric entry and parachute deployment, and landing worked as planned with perhaps only the final full panel deployment failing.

Comparison of Helioseismic Far-Side Active Region Detections with STEREO Far-Side EUV Observations of Solar Activity	SOLAR PHYSICS			English	Article						Active regions; Corona; Helioseismology; Space weather	SUN; HEMISPHERE; HOLOGRAPHY; SUNSPOT	Seismic maps of the Sun's far hemisphere, computed from Doppler data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are now being used routinely to detect strong magnetic regions on the far side of the Sun (http://jsoc. stanford. edu/data/farside/). To test the reliability of this technique, the helioseismically inferred active region detections are compared with far-side observations of solar activity from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), using brightness in extreme-ultraviolet light (EUV) as a proxy for magnetic fields. Two approaches are used to analyze nine months of STEREO and HMI data. In the first approach, we determine whether new large east-limb active regions are detected seismically on the far side before they appear Earth side and study how the detectability of these regions relates to their EUV intensity. We find that while there is a range of EUV intensities for which far-side regions may or may not be detected seismically, there appears to be an intensity level above which they are almost always detected and an intensity level below which they are never detected. In the second approach, we analyze concurrent extreme-ultraviolet and helioseismic far-side observations. We find that 100% (22) of the far-side seismic regions correspond to an extreme-ultraviolet plage; 95% of these either became a NOAA-designated magnetic region when reaching the east limb or were one before crossing to the far side. A low but significant correlation is found between the seismic signature strength and the EUV intensity of a far-side region.	[Liewer, P.

In addition to coseismic deformation related to the deep earthquake source, InSAR revealed three sharp surface displacement gradients. One of them is extensional and is inconsistent with the westward interseismic shortening of similar to 45 mm yr(-1) in this region. The gradient sharpness suggests slip triggering on shallow structures, some of which were not well documented before. To characterize these shallow structures, we investigated potential surface ruptures in the field. Sets of similar to NS tension cracks distributed over 25 - 300 m width, with cumulative extension in the same order as InSAR observations, were found along 5.5 km distance along the extensional gradient and are interpreted as surface rupture. We build two E-W regional balanced cross-sections, based on surface geology, subsurface data, and coseismic and interseismic geodetic data. From the Coastal Plain to the east edge of the coseismic deformation area, we propose a series of three active west-dipping backthrusts: the Houchiali fault, the Napalin-Pitou back-thrust, and the Lungchuan backthrust. They all root on the 3.5 - 4.0 km deep Tainan detachment located near the base of the 3-km-thick Gutingkeng mudstone. Further east, the detachment would ramp down to similar to 7 km depth. Coseismic surface deformation measurements suggest that, in addition to the deeper (15 - 0 km) main rupture plane, mostly the ramp, the Lungchuan backthrust, and the Tainan detachment were activated during or right after the earthquake. Local extension is considered as transient deformation at the west edge of the shallow main slip zone.

The challenges of implementing small satellites within limited resources can be daunting when faced with radiation effects on delicate electronics that require shielding or unique adaptations for protection, or mass, power" and volume limitations due to constraints placed by the carrier spacecraft, or even Planetary Protection compliant design techniques that drive assembly and testing. This paper will explore two concept studies where the environmental constraints and/or planetary protection mitigations drove the design of the Flight System. The paper will describe the key technical drivers on the Sylph mission concept to explore a plume at Europa as a secondary free-flyer as a part of the planned Europa Mission. Sylph is a radiation-hardened smallsat concept that would utilize terrain relative navigation to fly at low altitudes through a plume, if found, and relay the mass spectra data back through the flyby spacecraft during its 24-h mission. The second topic to be discussed will be the mission design constraints of the Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout concept. NEAScout is a 6U cubesat that would utilize an 86 sq. m solar sail as propulsion to execute a" flyby with a near-Earth asteroid and help retire Strategic Knowledge Gaps for future human exploration. NEAScout would cruise for 24 months to reach and characterize one Near-Earth asteroid that is representative of Human Exploration targets and telemeter that data directly back to Earth at the end of its roughly 2.5 year mission.

Findings include: 1) while technically feasible, a MoonVillage would be more distributed and complex a project than the ISS; 2) significant and distinctive opportunities exist for willing participants, at all evolutionary scales and degrees of commercialization; 3) the mixed-use space business park model is essential for growth and permanence; 4) growth depends on exporting lunar material products, and the rate and extent of growth depends on export customers including terrestrial industries; 5) industrial-scale operations are a precondition for lunar urbanism, which goal in turn dramatically drives technology requirements; but 6) industrial viability cannot be discerned until significant in situ operations occur; and therefore 7) government investment in lunar surface operations is a strictly enabling step. Because of the resources it could apply, the U.S. government holds the greatest leverage on growth, no matter who founds a MoonVillage. The interplanetary business to be built may because for engagement.

Evidence for Atmospheric Cold-trap Processes in the Noninverted Emission Spectrum of Kepler-13Ab Using HST/WFC3	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: atmospheres; stars: individual (Kepler-13); techniques: spectroscopic	EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; THEORETICAL SPECTRA; BROWN DWARFS; LIGHT CURVES; T-DWARFS; EXOPLANET; HOT; PARAMETERS; DATABASE; STARS	We observed two eclipses of the Kepler-13A planetary system, on UT 2014 April 28 and UT 2014 October 13, in the near-infrared using Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope. By using the nearby binary stars Kepler-13BC as a reference, we were able to create a differential light curve for Kepler-13A that had little of the systematics typically present in HST/WFC3 spectrophotometry. We measure a broadband (1.1-1.65 mu m) eclipse depth of 734 +/- 28 ppm and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the planet at R approximate to 50 with an average precision of 70 ppm. We find that Kepler-13Ab possesses a noninverted, monotonically decreasing vertical temperature profile. We exclude an isothermal profile and an inverted profile at more than 3 sigma. We also find that the dayside emission of Kepler-13Ab appears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective temperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of Kepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to cold-trap processes in the planet's atmosphere. Using a toy model for where cold traps should inhibit inversions, as well as observations of other planets in this temperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful constraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot Jupiters.

One sample, which is similar to 89% complete to K < 16 (Vega), consists of eight confirmed AGNs, four of which were identified with our follow-up program, and is selected to have red R - K colors (> 4, Vega). The fainter sample (K > 17, Vega) represents a pilot program to follow-up four sources from a parent sample of 34 that are not detected in the single-epoch SDSS catalog and have WISE quasar colors. All 12 sources are broad-line AGNs (at least one permitted emission line has an FWHM exceeding 1300 km s(-1)) and span a redshift range 0.59 < z < 2.5. Half the (R - K)-selected AGNs have features in their spectra suggestive of outflows. When comparing these sources to a matched sample of blue Type 1 AGNs, we find that the reddened AGNs are more distant (z > 0.5), and a greater percentage have high X-ray luminosities (L-X,L- full > 10(44) erg s(-1)). Such outflows and high luminosities may be consistent with the paradigm that reddened broad-line AGNs represent a transitory phase in AGN evolution as described by the major merger model for black hole growth. Results from our pilot program demonstrate proof of concept that our selection technique is successful in discovering reddened quasars at z > 1 missed by optical surveys.

The r'-band Af rho of 252P in a 0".2-radius aperture were 16.8 +/- 0.3 and 57 +/- 1 cm on March 14 and April 4, respectively, and its gas production rates were Q(OH) = (5.8 +/- 0.1)x 10(27) s(-1), and Q(CN) = (1.25 +/- 0.01). x. 10(25) s(-1) on April 17. The r'-band upper limit Af rho of BA14 was 0.19 +/- 0.01 cm in a 19".2-radius aperture, and Q(CN) = (1.4 +/- 0.1). x. 1022 s-1 on 2017 April 17. 252P shows a bright and narrow jet of a few hundred kilometers long in the sunward direction, changing its projected position angle in the sky with a periodicity consistent with 7.24 hr. However, its photometric light curve is consistent with a periodicity of 5.41 hr. We suggest that the nucleus of 252P is likely in a non-principal axis rotation. The nucleus radius of 252P is estimated to be about 0.3 +/- 0.03 km, indicating an active fraction of 40% to >100% in its 2016 apparition. Evidence implies a possible cloud of slow-moving grains surrounding the nucleus. The activity level of 252P in the 2016 apparition increased by two orders of magnitude from its previous apparitions, making this apparition unusual. On the other hand, the activity level of BA(14) appears to be at least three orders of magnitude lower than that of 252P, despite its 10 times or larger surface area.

Nitrogen Oxides in Early Earth's Atmosphere as Electron Acceptors for Life's Emergence	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Nitrogen oxides; Nitrate; Nitrite; Photochemistry; Lightning; Emergence of life.	GREEN RUSTS; ABIOTIC FIXATION; IRON FORMATIONS; NITRIC-OXIDE; YOUNG SUN; REDUCTION; NITRATE; TEMPERATURE; CHEMISTRY; ORIGIN	We quantify the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) produced through lightning and photochemical processes in the Hadean atmosphere to be available in the Hadean ocean for the emergence of life. Atmospherically generated nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) are the most attractive high-potential electron acceptors for pulling and enabling crucial redox reactions of autotrophic metabolic pathways at submarine alkaline hydrothermal vents. The Hadean atmosphere, dominated by CO2 and N-2, will produce nitric oxide (NO) when shocked by lightning. Photochemical reactions involving NO and H2O vapor will then produce acids such as HNO, HNO2, HNO3, and HO2NO2 that rain into the ocean. There, they dissociate into or react to form nitrate and nitrite. We present new calculations based on a novel combination of early-Earth global climate model and photochemical modeling, and we predict the flux of NOx to the Hadean ocean. In our 0.1-, 1-, and 10-bar pCO(2) models, we calculate the NOx delivery to be 2.4x10(5), 6.5x10(8), and 1.9x10(8) molecules cm(-2) s(-1). After only tens of thousands to tens of millions of years, these NOx fluxes are expected to produce sufficient (micromolar) ocean concentrations of high-potential electron acceptors for the emergence of life.

ABIOTIC ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; IRON SULFIDE; ELECTRON BIFURCATION; ANAEROBIC OXIDATION; NITRATE REDUCTION; ABIOGENIC METHANE; HUALALAI VOLCANO; NITROUS-OXIDE; HYDROGEN GAS	As many of the methanogens first encountered at hydrothermal vents were thermophilic to hyperthermophilic and comprised one of the lower roots of the evolutionary tree, it has been assumed that methanogenesis was one of the earliest, if not the earliest, pathway to life. It being well known that hydrothermal springs associated with serpentinization also bore abiotic methane, it had been further assumed that emergent biochemistry merely adopted and quickened this supposed serpentinization reaction. Yet, recent hydrothermal experiments simulating serpentinization have failed to generate methane so far, thus casting doubt on this assumption. The idea that the inverse view is worthy of debate, that is, that methanotrophy was the earlier, is stymied by the fact that methanotrophy itself has been termed reverse methanogenesis, so allotting the methanogens the founding pedigree. Thus, attempting to suggest instead that methanogenesis might be termed reverse methanotrophy would require unlearninga challenge to the subconscious! Here we re-examine the impossibility of methanotrophy predating methanogenesis as in what we have termed the denitrifying methanotrophic acetogenic pathway. Advantages offered by such thinking are that methane would not only be a fuel but also a ready source of reduced carbon to combine with formate or carbon monoxideavailable in hydrothermal fluidsto generate acetate, a target molecule of the first autotrophs. And the nitrate/nitrite required for the putative oxidation of methane with activated NO would also be a ready source of fixed nitrogen for amination reactions. Theoretical conditions for such a putative pathway would be met in a hydrothermal green rust-bearing exhalative pile and associated chimneys subject to proton and electron counter gradients. This hypothesis could be put to test in a high-pressure hydrothermal reaction chamber in which a cool carbonate/nitrate/nitrite-bearing early acidulous ocean simulant is juxtaposed across a precipitate membrane to an alkaline solution of hydrogen and methane.

The two clusters were observed in our "See Change" program, a Hubble Space Telescope survey of 12 massive high-redshift clusters aimed at high-z supernova measurements and weak-lensing estimation of accurate cluster masses. We detect weak but significant galaxy shape distortions using infrared images from the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), which has not yet been used for weak-lensing studies. Both clusters appear to possess relaxed morphology in projected mass distribution, and their mass centroids agree nicely with those defined by both the galaxy luminosity and X-ray emission. Using a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, for which weassume that the mass is tightly correlated with the concentration parameter, we determine the masses of SPT-CL J2040-4451 and IDCS J1426+3508 to be M-200=8.6(1.4)(+1.7)x10(14) M-circle dot and 2.2(0.7)(+1.1)x10(14) M-circle dot, respectively. The weak-lensing mass of SPT-CL. J2040-4451 shows that the cluster is clearly a rare object. Adopting the central value, the expected abundance of such a massive cluster at z greater than or similar to 1.48 is only similar to 0.07 in the parent 2500 sq. deg. survey. However, it is yet premature to claim that the presence of this cluster creates a serious tension with the current ACDM paradigm unless that tension will remain in future studies after marginalizing over many sources of uncertainties such as the accuracy of the mass function and the mass-concentration relation at the high-mass end. The mass of IDCS J1426+3508 is in excellent agreement with our previous Advanced Camera for Surveys-based weak-lensing result, while the much higher source density from our WFC3 imaging data makes the current statistical uncertainty similar to 40% smaller.

H-2 X (1)Sigma(+)(g) - c (3)Pi(u) Excitation by Electron Impact: Energies, Spectra, Emission Yields, Cross-sections, and H(1s) Kinetic Energy Distributions	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						molecular data; molecular processes	QUANTUM-DEFECT THEORY; INFRARED-LASER SPECTROSCOPY; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM STATES; TRIPLET GERADE COMPLEX; AB-INITIO CALCULATION; B 3-SIGMA-U+ STATE; D2 RYDBERG STATES; HYDROGEN MOLECULE; TRANSITION MOMENTS; FINE-STRUCTURE	The c (3)Pi(u) state of the hydrogen molecule has the second largest triplet-state excitation cross-section, and plays an important role in the heating of the upper thermospheres of outer planets by electron excitation. Precise energies of the H-2, D-2, and HD c (3)Pi(-)(u)(v, N) levels are calculated from highly accurate ab initio potential energy curves that include relativistic, radiative, and empirical non-adiabatic corrections. The emission yields are determined from predissociation rates and refined radiative transition probabilities. The excitation function and excitation cross-section of the c (3)Pi(u) state are extracted from previous theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. The emission cross-section is determined from the calculated emission yield and the extracted excitation cross-section. The kinetic energy (E-k) distributions of H atoms produced via the predissociation of the c (3)Pi(u) state, the c (3)Pi(-)(u)-b (3)Sigma(+)(u) dissociative emission by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole, and the c (3)Pi(u) - a (3)Sigma(+)(g) - b (3)Sigma(+)(u) cascade dissociative emission by the electric dipole are obtained. The predissociation of the c (3)Pi(+)(u) and c (3)Pi(-)(u) states both produce H(1s) atoms with an average E-k of similar to 4.1 eV/atom, while the c (3)Pi(-)(u)-b (3)Sigma(+)(u) dissociative emissions by the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole give an average E-k of similar to 1.0 and similar to 0.8 eV/atom, respectively. The c (3)Pi(u) - a (3)Pi(+)(u) - b (3)Sigma(+)(u) cascade and dissociative emission gives an average E-k of similar to 1.3 eV/atom. On average, each H-2 excited to the c (3)Pi(u) state in an H-2-dominated atmosphere deposits similar to 7.1 eV into the atmosphere while each H-2 directly excited to the a (3)Sigma(+)(g) and d (3)Pi(u) states contribute similar to 2.3 and similar to 3.3 eV, respectively, to the atmosphere. The spectral distribution of the calculated continuum emission arising from the X (1)Sigma(+)(g) - c (3)Pi(u) excitation is significantly different from that of direct a (3)Sigma(+)(g) or d (3)Pi(u) excitations.

Decelerating uplift at Lazufre volcanic center, Central Andes, from AD2010 to 2016, and implications for geodetic models	GEOSPHERE			English	Article							LONG-VALLEY-CALDERA; SURFACE DEFORMATION; YELLOWSTONE CALDERA; GROUND DEFORMATION; ELASTIC RESPONSE; TENSILE FAULTS; TIME-SERIES; INSAR; GPS; CALIFORNIA	Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and GPS measurements beyond 2010 are presented for the first time for the Lazufre volcanic center in the Central Andes. Vertical uplift at Lazufre was known to affect an area >50 km in diameter at rates exceeding 3 cm/yr between 1997 and 2010. Analysis of new InSAR data through August 2016 indicates that the spatial pattern of uplift is relatively unchanged but the amplitude of uplift has significantly decreased to <1.5 cm/yr since at least December 2011. We present a time-series inversion for InSAR data between 1996 and 2016 that is well fit by a double exponential model, with an inflection point occurring in 2006. For two continuous GPS stations installed within the deformation footprint in November 2010, we have determined vertical velocities through 2014 or 2015 (depending on the station) that agree with contemporaneous InSAR-derived velocities. Velocities from campaign GPS benchmarks established in November 2011 and reoccupied in March 2014 are also presented. We use a previously proposed model of an inflating sill at 10 km depth to explain geodetically observed dis-placements. Opening rates are halved (6.8 +/- 1.25 x 10(6) m(3)/yr) compared to inferred values using data prior to 2010. Subsurface heterogeneity is accounted for by assigning elastic parameters based on local seismic tomography in a finite-element model. Surface displacements (or inferred volume change estimates) for heterogeneous models compared to homogeneous models are ampli-fied by up to 7% within a 10 km radius of the center of uplift.

Neptune long-lived atmospheric features in 2013-2015 from small (28-cm) to large (10-m) telescopes	ICARUS			English	Article						Neptune; Neptune, atmosphere; Atmospheres, dynamics	CLOUD STRUCTURE; EPIC SIMULATIONS; ADAPTIVE OPTICS; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; HST; WINDS	Since 2013, observations of Neptune with small telescopes (28-50 cm) have resulted in several detections of long-lived bright atmospheric features that have also been observed by large telescopes such as Keck II or Hubble. The combination of both types of images allows the study of the long-term evolution of major cloud systems in the planet. In 2013 and 2014 two bright features were present on the planet at southern mid-latitudes. These may have merged in late 2014, possibly leading to the formation of a single bright feature observed during 2015 at the same latitude. This cloud system was first observed in January 2015 and nearly continuously from July to December 2015 in observations with telescopes in the 2-10-m class and in images from amateur astronomers. These images show the bright spot as a compact feature at -40.1 +/- 1.6 degrees planetographic latitude well resolved from a nearby bright zonal band that extended from -42 degrees to -20 degrees. The size of this system depends on wavelength and varies from a longitudinal extension of 8000 +/- 900 km and latitudinal extension of 6500 +/- 900 km in Keck II images in H and Ks bands to 5100 +/- 1400 km in longitude and 4500 +/- 1400 km in latitude in HST images in 657 nm. Over July to September 2015 the structure drifted westward in longitude at a rate of 24.48 +/- 0.03 degrees/day or -94 +/- 3 m/s. This is about 30 mks slower than the zonal winds measured at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby. Tracking its motion from July to November 2015 suggests a longitudinal oscillation of 16 in amplitude with a 90-day period, typical of dark spots on Neptune and similar to the Great Red Spot oscillation in Jupiter. The limited time covered by high-resolution observations only covers one full oscillation and other interpretations of the changing motions could be possible. HST images in September 2015 show the presence of a dark spot at short wavelengths located in the southern flank (planetographic latitude -47.0 degrees) of the bright compact cloud observed throughout 2015. The drift rate of the bright cloud and dark spot translates to a zonal speed of -87.0 +/- 2.0 mks, which matches the Voyager 2 zonal speeds at the latitude of the dark spot. Identification of a few other features in 2015 enabled the extraction of some limited wind information over this period. This work demonstrates the need of frequently monitoring Neptune to understand its atmospheric dynamics and shows excellent opportunities for professional and amateur collaborations.

The Curiosity rover has two mast cameras (Mastcams) that acquire stereo images at a number of different wavelengths. Each camera has nine bands of which six bands are overlapped in the two cameras. These acquired stereo band images at different wavelengths can be fused into a 12-band multispectral image cube, which could be helpful to guide the rover to interesting locations. Since the two Mastcams' fields of view are three times different from each other, in order to fuse the left-and right-camera band images to form a multispectral image cube, there is a need for a precise image alignment of the stereo images with registration errors at the subpixel level. A two-step image alignment approach with a novel utilization of existing image registration algorithms is introduced in this paper and is applied to a set of Mastcam stereo images. The effect of the two-step alignment approach using more than 100 pairs of Mastcam images, selected from over 500000 images in NASA's Planetary Data System database, clearly demonstrated that the fused images can improve pixel clustering and anomaly detection performance. In particular, registration errors in the subpixel level are observed with the applied alignment approach. Moreover, the pixel clustering and anomaly detection performance have been observed to be better when using fused images.

Probabilistic and Distributed Control of a Large-Scale Swarm of Autonomous Agents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS			English	Article						Guidance; Markov chains; multiagent systems; path planning; swarm robotics	MARKOV-CHAINS; STRATEGIES; OPTIMIZATION; ASSIGNMENT; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; MODEL	We present a distributed control algorithm simultaneously solving both the stochastic target assignment and optimal motion control for large-scale swarms to achieve complex formation shapes. Our probabilistic swarm guidance using inhomogeneous Markov chains (PSG-IMC) algorithm adopts a Eulerian density-control framework, under which the physical space is partitioned into multiple bins and the swarm's density distribution over each bin is controlled in a probabilistic fashion to efficiently handle loss or the addition of agents. We assume that the number of agents is much larger than the number of bins and that each agent knows in which bin it is located, the desired formation shape, and the objective function and motion constraints. PSG-IMC determines the bin-to-bin transition probabilities of each agent using a time IMC. These time-varying Markov matrices are computed by each agent in real time using the feedback from the current swarm distribution, which is estimated in a distributed manner. The PSG-IMC algorithm minimizes the expected cost of transitions per time instant that are required to achieve andmaintain the desired formation shape, even if agents are added to or removed from the swarm. PSG-IMC scales well with a large number of agents and complex formation shapes and can also be adapted for area exploration applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed swarm guidance algorithm by using numerical simulations and hardware experiments with multiple quadrotors.

Conditions for Sublimating Water Ice to Supply Ceres' Exosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							GROUND ICE; SURFACE; DIFFUSION; STABILITY; VAPOR; MODEL	Observations of a water vapor exosphere around Ceres suggest that the dwarf planet may be episodically outgassing at a rate of similar to 6 kg s(-1) from unknown sources. With data from the Dawn mission as constraints, we use a coupled thermal and vapor diffusion model to explore three different configurations of water ice (global buried pore-filling ice, global buried excess ice, and local exposed surface ice) that could be present on Ceres. We conclude that a buried ice table cannot alone explain the vapor production rates previously measured, but newly exposed surface ice, given the right conditions, can exceed that vapor production rate. Sublimation lag deposits form that bury and darken this surface ice over a large range of timescales (from < 1 year to approximately hundreds of kyr) that depend on latitude and ice regolith content. Sublimating water vapor can loft regolith particles from the surface of exposed ice, possibly prolonging the visible lifespan of those areas. We find that this process is only effective for regolith grains smaller than approximately ones of microns. Plain Language Summary A thin water vapor atmosphere has been previously detected around Ceres, a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, from space telescope observations. Based on data collected before the Dawn spacecraft's arrival, Ceres potentially contained a large mass of water ice. However, how that water, frozen within Ceres, could be fueling a tenuous water vapor atmosphere has been previously unknown. We explore the possibility of water vapor coming from either a buried ice table or buried surface ice at the same rate detected by previous observations. We use published data from the Dawn spacecraft mission to compare to our thermal and sublimation models. We conclude that given the right place and time, exposed surface ice can generate enough water vapor to replicate Ceres' tenuous atmosphere.	[Landis, M.

Martian aeolian activity at the Bagnold Dunes, Gale Crater: The view from the surface and orbit	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							SALTATION THRESHOLD; WIND-TUNNEL; MARS; TRANSPORT; EARTH; TRAVERSE; IMAGES; SUITE; REMS	The first in situ investigation of an active dune field on another planetary surface occurred in 2015-2016 when the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover investigated the Bagnold Dunes on Mars. High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment images show clear seasonal variations that are in good agreement with atmospheric model predictions of intra-annual sand flux and migration directions that together indicate that the campaign occurred during a period of low wind activity. Curiosity surface images show that limited changes nevertheless occurred, with movement of large grains, particularly on freshly exposed surfaces, two occurrences of secondary grain flow on the slip face of Namib Dune, and a slump on a freshly exposed surface of a large ripple. These changes are seen at Martian solar day (sol)-to-sol time scales. Grains on a rippled sand deposit and unconsolidated dump piles show limited movement of large grains over a few hours during which mean friction speeds are estimated at 0.3-0.4 m s(-1). Overall, the correlation between changes and peak Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) winds is moderate, with high wind events associated with changes in some cases, but not in others, suggesting that other factors are also at work. The distribution of REMS 1 Hz wind speeds shows a significant tail up to the current 20 m s(-1) calibration limit, indicating that even higher speed winds occur. Nonaeolian triggering mechanisms are also possible. The low activity period at the dunes documented by Curiosity provides clues to processes that dominated in the Martian past under conditions of lower obliquity. Plain Language Summary The modification of Martian sand dunes and nearby areas by the wind is monitored from the surface by the Curiosity rover and from orbit by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera. When the rover was at the dunes, changes were small but still showed moving grains and slumps. The results indicate that surface changes occur even in low activity periods, providing insight into past Martian climates.	[Bridges, N.

Geochemistry of the Bagnold dune field as observed by ChemCam and comparison with other aeolian deposits at Gale Crater	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY; CURIOSITY ROVER TRAVERSE; COBBLE-SIZED CLASTS; INSTRUMENT SUITE; MARS; CALIBRATION; CHEMISTRY; SEDIMENTOLOGY; GRANULOMETRY; PEBBLE	The Curiosity rover conducted the first field investigation of an active extraterrestrial dune. This study of the Bagnold dunes focuses on the ChemCam chemical results and also presents findings on the grain size distributions based on the ChemCam Remote Micro-Imager and Mars Hand Lens Imager images. These active dunes are composed of grains that are mostly < 250 mu m. Their composition is overall similar to that of the aeolian deposits analyzed all along the traverse ("Aeolis Palus soils"). Nevertheless, the dunes contain less volatiles (Cl, H, and S) than the Aeolis Palus soils, which appear to be due to a lower content of volatile-rich fine-grained particles (< 100 mu m) or a lower content of volatile-rich amorphous component, possibly as a result of (1) a lower level of chemical alteration, (2) the removal of an alteration rind at the surface of the grains during transport, (3) a lower degree of interaction with volcanic gases/aerosols, or (4) physical sorting that removed the smallest and most altered grains. Analyses of the > 150 mu m grain-size dump piles have shown that coarser grains (150-250 mu m) are enriched in the mafic elements Fe and Mn, suggesting a larger content in olivine compared to smaller grains (< 150 mu m) of the Bagnold dunes. Moreover, the chemistry of soils analyzed in the vicinity of the dunes indicates that they are similar to the dune material. All these observations suggest that the olivine content determined by X-ray diffraction of the < 150 mu m grain-size sample should be considered as a lower limit for the Bagnold dunes. Plain Language Summary The Curiosity rover, which is exploring the Gale Crater on Mars, has been investigating a dune field. This is the first time an active and extensive dune field is explored by a rover on Mars, and therefore, Curiosity used all the instruments on board in order to better understand how the dunes can form and with what processes and also to assess their chemistry. This in situ investigation was a great opportunity to compare with orbital data. Our work is focusing on chemical data from the ChemCam instrument, as well as on grain size distributions from the image analyses of two cameras. We show that, overall, the dunes are similar in chemistry to the soils analyzed along the traverse, but they are depleted in H, Cl, and S, suggesting that they contain less fine-grained particles or less amorphous component (which is known to be enriched in such elements). This could be due to several processes that we try to investigate. Also, we show that the coarser grains of the dunes (150-250 mu m) are enriched in Fe and Mn, probably due to an enrichment in olivine.

Evaporation from a shallow, saline lake in the Nebraska Sandhills: Energy balance drivers of seasonal and interannual variability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							FLUCTUATING BOWEN RATIO; SAND HILLS; WATER-BALANCE; LONG-TERM; SEA; SURFACE; BUDGET; WETLAND; MODEL; USA	Despite potential evaporation rates in excess of the local precipitation, dry climates often support saline lakes through groundwater inputs of water and associated solutes. These groundwater-fed lakes are important indicators of environmental change, in part because their shallow water levels and salinity are very sensitive to weather and climatic variability. Some of this sensitivity arises from high rates of open-water evaporation, which is a dominant but poorly quantified process for saline lakes. This study used the Bowen ratio energy budget method to calculate open-water evaporation rates for Alkali Lake, a saline lake in the Nebraska Sandhills region (central United States), where numerous groundwater fed lakes occupy the landscape. Evaporation rates were measured during the warm season (May October) over three consecutive years (2007-2009) to gain insights into the climatic and limnological factors driving evaporation, as well as the partitioning of energy balance components at seasonal and inter annual time scales. Results show a seasonal peak in evaporation rate in late June of 7.0 mm day(-1) (on average), with a maximum daily rate of 10.5 mm day(-1) and a 3-year mean July-September (JAS) rate of 5.1 mm day(-1), which greatly exceeds the long-term JAS precipitation rate of 1.3 mm day(-1). Seasonal variability in lake evaporation closely follows that of net radiation and lake surface temperature, with sensible heat flux and heat storage variations being relatively small, except in response to short-term, synoptic events. Interannual changes in the surface energy balance were weak, by comparison, although a 6-fold increase in mean lake level over the three years (0.05-0.30 m) led to greater heat storage within the lake, an enhanced JAS lake-air temperature gradient, and greater sensible heat loss. These large variations in water level were also associated with large changes in absolute salinity (from 28 to 118 g kg(-1)), with periods of high salinity characterized by reductions in mass transfer estimates of evaporation rate by up to 20%, depending on atmospheric conditions and absolute salinity. Energy balance estimates of evaporation, on the other hand, were found to be less sensitive to variations in salinity. These results provide regional insights for lakes in the Nebraska Sandhills region and implications for estimation of the energy and water balance of saline lakes in similar arid and semi-arid landscapes.

However, there is large uncertainty among existing ET products from Landsat that limit their application. This study presents a simple Taylor skill fusion (STS) method that merges five Landsat-based ET products and directly measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) to improve the global estimation of terrestrial ET. The STS method uses a weighted average of the individual ET products and weights are determined by their Taylor skill scores (S). The validation with site-scale measurements at 206 EC flux towers showed large differences and uncertainties among the five ET products. The merged ET product exhibited the best performance with a decrease in the averaged root-mean-square error (RMSE) by 2-5 W/m(2) when compared to the individual products. To evaluate the reliability of the STS method at the regional scale, the weights of the STS method for these five ET products were determined using EC ground-measurements. An example of regional ET mapping demonstrates that the STS-merged ET can effectively integrate the individual Landsat ET products.

The L4_SM product is available from 31 March 2015 to present (within 3 days from real time) and provides 3-hourly, global, 9-km resolution estimates of surface (0-5 cm) and root-zone (0-100 cm) soil moisture and land surface conditions. This study presents an overview of the L4_SM algorithm, validation approach, and product assessment versus in situ measurements. Core validation sites provide spatially averaged surface (root zone) soil moisture measurements for 43 (17) "reference pixels'' at 9- and 36-km gridcell scales located in 17 (7) distinct watersheds. Sparse networks provide point-scale measurements of surface (root zone) soil moisture at 406 (311) locations. Core validation site results indicate that the L4_SM product meets its soil moisture accuracy requirement, specified as an unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE, or standard deviation of the error) of 0.04 m(3) m(-3) or better. The ubRMSE for L4_SM surface (root zone) soil moisture is 0.038 m(3) m(-3) (0.030 m(3) m(-3)) at the 9-km scale and 0.035 m(3) m(-3) (0.026 m(3) m(-3)) at the 36-km scale. The L4_SM estimates improve (significantly at the 5% level for surface soil moisture) over model-only estimates, which do not benefit from the assimilation of SMAP brightness temperature observations and have a 9-km surface (root zone) ubRMSE of 0.042 m(3) m(-3) (0.032 m(3) m(-3)). Time series correlations exhibit similar relative performance. The sparse network results corroborate these findings over a greater variety of climate and land cover conditions.

The pebbles/boulders size distributions on Sais: Rosetta's final landing site on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: statistical; comets: individual (67P C-G)	OSIRIS; COLORS; SYSTEM; 67P	By using the imagery acquired by the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System Wide-Angle Camera (OSIRISWAC), we prepare a high-resolution morphological map of the Rosetta Sais final landing site, characterized by an outcropping consolidated terrain unit, a coarse boulder deposit and a fine particle deposit. Thanks to the 0.014 m resolution images, we derive the pebbles/boulders size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the area in the size range of 0.07-0.70 m. Sais' SFD is best fitted with a two-segment differential power law: the first segment is in the range 0.07-0.26 m, with an index of -1.7 +/- 0.1, while the second is in the range 0.26-0.50 m, with an index of -4.2 +0.4/-0.8. The 'knee' of the SFD, located at 0.26 m, is evident both in the coarse and fine deposits. When compared to the Agilkia Rosetta Lander Imaging System images, Sais surface is almost entirely free of the ubiquitous, cm-sized debris blanket observed by Philae. None the less, a similar SFD behaviour of Agilkia, with a steeper distribution above similar to 0.3 m, and a flatter trend below that, is observed. The activity evolution of 67P along its orbit provides a coherent scenario of how these deposits were formed. Indeed, different lift pressure values occurring on the two locations and at different heliocentric distances explain the presence of the cm-sized debris blanket on Agilkia observed at 3.0 au inbound. Contrarily, Sais activity after 2.1 au outbound has almost completely eroded the fine deposits fallen during perihelion, resulting in an almost dust-free surface observed at 3.8 au.

Major AGN flares	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric; surveys; quasars: general	SOUTHERN SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC STANDARDS; BLACK-HOLE BINARY; STELLAR; ABSORPTION; DISCOVERY; REDSHIFTS; EMISSION; SKY	There is a large degree of variety in the optical variability of quasars and it is unclear whether this is all attributable to a single (set of) physical mechanism(s). We present the results of a systematic search for major flares in active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey as part of a broader study into extreme quasar variability. Such flares are defined in a quantitative manner as being atop of the normal, stochastic variability of quasars. We have identified 51 events from over 900 000 known quasars and high-probability quasar candidates, typically lasting 900 d and with a median peak amplitude of Delta m = 1.25 mag. Characterizing the flare profile with a Weibull distribution, we find that nine of the sources are well described by a single-point single-lens model. This supports the proposal by Lawrence et al. that microlensing is a plausible physical mechanism for extreme variability. However, we attribute the majority of our events to explosive stellar-related activity in the accretion disc: superluminous supernovae, tidal disruption events and mergers of stellar mass black holes.

DES Collaboration	DES15E2mlf: a spectroscopically confirmed superluminous supernova that exploded 3.5 Gyr after the big bang	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: DES15E2mlf	MASS-METALLICITY RELATION; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; LUMINOUS SUPERNOVAE; IA SUPERNOVAE; REDSHIFTS; EVOLUTION; EXPLOSIONS; ORIGIN; SAMPLE	We present the Dark Energy Survey (DES) discovery of DES15E2mlf, the most distant superluminous supernova (SLSN) spectroscopically confirmed to date. The light curves and Gemini spectroscopy of DES15E2mlf indicate that it is a Type I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) at z = 1.861 (a lookback time of similar to 10 Gyr) and peaking at M-AB = -22.3 +/- 0.1 mag. Given the high redshift, our data probe the rest-frame ultraviolet (1400-3500 angstrom) properties of the SN, finding velocity of the C III feature changes by similar to 5600 km s(-1) over 14 d around maximum light. We find the host galaxy of DES15E2mlf has a stellar mass of 3.5(-2.4)(+3.6) x 10(9) M-circle dot, which is more massive than the typical SLSN-I host galaxy.	[Pan, Y. -C.; Foley, R.

Response of the Martian ionosphere to solar activity including SEPs and ICMEs in a two-week period starting on 25 February 2015	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							ION ESCAPE; MARS-EXPRESS; WIND INTERACTION; LOCATIONS	In a two-week period between February and March of 2015, a series of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and solar energetic particle (SEP) events encountered Mars. The interactions were observed by several spacecraft, including Mars Express (MEX), Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), and Mars Odyssey (MO). The ICME disturbances were characterized by an increase in ion speed, plasma temperature, magnetic field magnitude, and energetic electron flux. Furthermore, increased solar wind density and speeds, as well as unusually high local electron densities and high flow velocities were detected on the nightside at high altitudes during the March 8 event. These effects are thought to be due to the transport of ionospheric plasma away from Mars. In the deep nightside, the peak ionospheric electron density at the periapsis of MEX shows a substantial increase, reaching number densities about 2.7 x 10(4) cm(-3) during the second ICME in the deep nightside. This corresponds to an increase in the MO High-Energy Neutron Detector flux suggesting an increase in the ionization of the neutral atmosphere due to the high intensity of charged particles. Measurements of the SEP fluxs show a substantial enhancement before the shock of a fourth ICME causing impact ionization and absorption of the surface echo intensity which drops to the noise levels, below 10(-15) V(2)m(-2) Hz(-1) from values of about 2 x 10(-14) (VM-2)-M-2 Hz(-1). Moreover, the peak ionospheric density exhibits a discrete enhancement over a period of about 30 h around the same location, which may be due to impact ionization.

However, trade-offs still exist between lidar pulse density and accuracy of AGB estimates. We assessed the impacts of lidar pulse density on the estimation of AGB stocks and changes using airborne lidar and field plot data in a selectively logged tropical forest located near Paragominas, Para, Brazil. Field-derived AGB was computed at 85 square 50 x 50 m plots in 2014. Lidar data were acquired in 2012 and 2014, and for each dataset the pulse density was subsampled from its original density of 13.8 and 37.5 pulses.m(-2) to lower densities of 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.2 pulses.m(-2). For each pulse density dataset, a power-law model was developed to estimate AGB stocks from lidar-derived mean height and corresponding changes between the years 2012 and 2014. We found that AGB change estimates at the plot level were only slightly affected by pulse density. However, at the landscape level we observed differences in estimated AGB change of >20 Mg.ha(-1) when pulse density decreased from 12 to 0.2 pulses.m(-2). The effects of pulse density were more pronounced in areas of steep slope, especially when the digital terrain models (DTMs) used in the lidar derived forest height were created from reduced pulse density data. In particular, when the DTM from high pulse density in 2014 was used to derive the forest height from both years, the effects on forest height and the estimated AGB stock and changes did not exceed 20 Mg.ha(-1). The results suggest that AGB change can be monitored in selective logging in tropical forests with reasonable accuracy and low cost with low pulse density lidar surveys if a baseline high-quality DTM is available from at least one lidar survey. We recommend the results of this study to be considered in developing projects and national level MRV systems for REDD+ emission reduction programs for tropical forests.

CEDAR-GEM Challenge for Systematic Assessment of Ionosphere/Thermosphere Models in Predicting TEC During the 2006 December Storm Event	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						quantitative assessment of prediction capability of ionosphere; thermosphere models; TEC prediction during the 2006 December Storm Event; CEDAR-GEM challenge	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; GLOBAL-MODEL; IONOSPHERE; SATELLITE; VALIDATION; MAPS	In order to assess current modeling capability of reproducing storm impacts on total electron content (TEC), we considered quantities such as TEC, TEC changes compared to quiet time values, and the maximum value of the TEC and TEC changes during a storm. We compared the quantities obtained from ionospheric models against ground-based GPS TEC measurements during the 2006 AGU storm event (14-15 December 2006) in the selected eight longitude sectors. We used 15 simulations obtained from eight ionospheric models, including empirical, physics-based, coupled ionosphere-thermosphere, and data assimilation models. To quantitatively evaluate performance of the models in TEC prediction during the storm, we calculated skill scores such as RMS error, Normalized RMS error (NRMSE), ratio of the modeled to observed maximum increase (Yield), and the difference between the modeled peak time and observed peak time. Furthermore, to investigate latitudinal dependence of the performance of the models, the skill scores were calculated for five latitude regions. Our study shows that RMSE of TEC and TEC changes of the model simulations range from about 3 TECU (total electron content unit, 1 TECU = 10(16) el m(-2)) (in high latitudes) to about 13 TECU (in low latitudes), which is larger than latitudinal average GPS TEC error of about 2 TECU. Most model simulations predict TEC better than TEC changes in terms of NRMSE and the difference in peak time, while the opposite holds true in terms of Yield. Model performance strongly depends on the quantities considered, the type of metrics used, and the latitude considered.	[Shim, J.

At its native resolution, SWOT height errors are expected to be on the order of meters, which prevent the calculation of water surface slopes and the use of slope-dependent discharge equations. To mitigate height and width errors, the high-resolution measurements will be grouped into reaches (similar to 5 to 15 km), where slope and discharge are estimated. We describe three automated river segmentation strategies for defining optimum reaches for discharge estimation: (1) arbitrary lengths, (2) identification of hydraulic controls, and (3) sinuosity. We test our methodologies on 9 and 14 simulated SWOT overpasses over the Sacramento and the Po Rivers, respectively, which we compare against hydraulic models of each river. Our results show that generally, height, width, and slope errors decrease with increasing reach length. However, the hydraulic controls and the sinuosity methods led to better slopes and often height errors that were either smaller or comparable to those of arbitrary reaches of compatible sizes. Estimated discharge errors caused by the propagation of height, width, and slope errors through the discharge equation were often smaller for sinuosity (on average 8.5% for the Sacramento and 6.9% for the Po) and hydraulic control (Sacramento: 7.3% and Po: 5.9%) reaches than for arbitrary reaches of comparable lengths (Sacramento: 8.6% and Po: 7.8%). This analysis suggests that reach definition methods that preserve the hydraulic properties of the river network may lead to better discharge estimates.

We have developed an orbital advection algorithm suitable for the induction equation with magnetic potential. The electromotive force is split into advection and shear terms, and we find that we do not need an advective gauge since solving the orbital advection implicitly precludes the shear term from canceling the advection term. We prove and demonstrate the third order in time accuracy of the scheme. The algorithm is also suited to non-magnetic problems. Benchmarked results of (hydrodynamical) planet-disk interaction and of the magnetorotational instability are reproduced. We include detailed descriptions of the construction and selection of stabilizing dissipations (or high-frequency filters) needed to generate practical results. The scheme is self-consistent, accurate, and elegant in its simplicity, making it particularly efficient for straightforward finite-difference methods. As a result of the work, the algorithm is incorporated in the public version of the PENCIL CODE, where it can be used by the community.

Quantifying the Impact of Spectral Coverage on the Retrieval of Molecular Abundances from Exoplanet Transmission Spectra	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						radiative transfer; planets and satellites: atmospheres; techniques: spectroscopic; instrumentation: spectrographs	TRANSITING PLANET ATMOSPHERES; SPITZER-SPACE-TELESCOPE; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; HD 189733B; WATER ABUNDANCE; SPECTROSCOPY; CLOUDS; C/O; 209458B; MISSION	Using forward models for representative exoplanet atmospheres and a radiometric instrument model, we generated synthetic observational data to explore how well the major C- and O-bearing chemical species (CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O), important for determining atmospheric opacity and radiation balance, can be constrained by transit measurements as a function of spectral wavelength coverage. This work features simulations for a notional transit spectroscopy mission and compares two cases for instrument spectral coverage (wavelength coverage from 0.5-2.5 mu m and 0.5-5 mu m). The simulation is conducted on a grid with a range of stellar magnitudes and incorporates a full retrieval of atmospheric model parameters. We consider a range of planets from sub-Neptunes to hot Jupiters and include both low and high mean molecular weight atmospheres. We find that including the 2.5-5 mu m wavelength range provides a significant improvement in the degree of constraint on the retrieved molecular abundances: up to similar to 3 orders of magnitude for a low mean molecular weight atmosphere (mu = 2.3) and up to a factor of similar to 6 for a high mean molecular weight atmosphere (mu = 28). These decreased uncertainties imply that broad spectral coverage between the visible and the mid-infrared is an important tool for understanding the chemistry and composition of exoplanet atmospheres. This analysis suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) 0.6-5 mu m prism spectroscopy mode, or similar wavelength coverage with possible future missions, will be an important resource for exoplanet atmospheric characterization.

Mg Incorporation Efficiency in Pulsed MOCVD of N-Polar GaN:Mg	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Mg incorporation; MOCVD; N-polar; doping; SIMS	CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; P-TYPE CONDUCTION; IMPURITY INCORPORATION; PHASE EPITAXY; DOPED GAN; GROWTH; ALXGA1-XN; SAPPHIRE; SURFACES; OXYGEN	We report on the effect of growth polarity and pulsed or -doped growth mode on impurity incorporation in metalorganic chemical vapor deposition-grown GaN. In Ga-polar orientation, up to 12x enhancement in Mg concentration for given Mg flow rate is observed, resulting in enhanced p-type conductivity for these samples. In contrast, this enhancement effect is greatly diminished for N-polar samples, falling off with increasing Mg flow and showing maximum enhancement of 2.7x at 30 nmol/min Mg flow. At higher Mg flow rates, Mg incorporation at normal levels did not correspond to p-type conductivity, which may be due to Mg incorporation at nonacceptor sites. Concentrations of C, O, and Si were also investigated, revealing dependence on Mg flow in N-polar pulsed samples. Carbon incorporation was found to decrease with increasing Mg flow, and oxygen incorporation was found to remain high across varied Mg flow. These effects combine to result in N-polar samples that are not p-type when using the pulsed growth mode.

J	Bellan, J				Bellan, Josette			From elementary kinetics in perfectly stirred reactors to reduced kinetics utilizable in turbulent reactive flow simulations for combustion devices	COMBUSTION AND FLAME			English	Article						Highly-reduced chemical kinetics; Laminar flames; Turbulent flames	MASS DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; N-HEPTANE; COUNTERFLOW FLAMES; SELF-SIMILARITY; OXIDATION; PRESSURE; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; ISOOCTANE	This study addresses the protocol of tests for evaluating the performance of skeletal, reduced and highly reduced chemical kinetics mechanisms for one-dimensional (1D) laminar flame simulations and the validity of these tests for turbulent flame applications. Taking n-heptane as an example fuel, it is first shown that there are apparent disagreements regarding the elementary-reaction chemical kinetics models which should be emulated by reduced kinetic mechanisms. Further it is also shown, expectably, that the functional relationship between mass fractions and temperature is different between OD and 1D models, and it is different among 1D models having different molecular species-transport formulations. Having identified the retention of this functional relationship as pivotal in the success of highly-reduced reaction mechanisms to accurately simulate spatial configurations, it is demonstrated that the unity Lewis-number assumption biases this functional relationship such that the highly-reduced chemical kinetic mechanism LS2T 20-species mechanism (LS2T 20) used for 1D flame simulations fails to agree with the template but provides accurate predictions in conjunction with, for example, the mixture-average diffusion model at otherwise the same initial conditions as the unity-Lewis-number simulation. The LS2T 20 success extends to the cold-ignition regime. For rich conditions the mixture-average diffusion approximation is less acceptable, and if the transport model does not include the direct effect of the heavy species (which are all modeled in LS2T) on the light species (which are all computed in LS2T), moderate departures of the 1D predictions from the template are obtained around the peak OH mass fraction, whereas CO2 is still excellently reproduced by LS2T 20. It is then conjectured that, independent of the reduction method, the more reduced is a kinetic mechanism, the more accurate the transport formulation should be to ensure the preservation of the species/temperature functional relationship; due to the extensive investigation necessary to evaluate this conjecture, this activity is relegated to future studies.

Predicting the nature of the information gain, and developing the tools to realize it, depends on establishing a consistent model of how the galaxies detected by each survey trace the same underlying matter distribution. Existing analytic methods, such as halo occupation distribution modelling, are not well suited for this task, and can suffer from ambiguities and tuning issues when applied to multiple tracers. In this paper, we take the first step towards constructing an alternative that provides a common model for the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes across a wide range of wavelengths (and thus tracer populations). This is based on a chain of parametrized statistical distributions that model the connection between (i) halo mass and bulk physical properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate; and (ii) those same physical properties and a variety of emission processes. The result is a flexible parametric model that allows analytic halo model calculations of one-point functions to be carried out for multiple tracers, as well as providing semi realistic galaxy properties for fast mock catalogue generation.

Periodic eclipses of the young star PDS 110 discovered with WASP and KELT photometry	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						protoplanetary discs; circumstellar matter; stars: individual: PDS 110; stars: pre-main-sequence; stars: variables: T Tauri; Herbig Ae/Be	HERBIG AE/BE STARS; T-TAURI STARS; MAIN-SEQUENCE; INFRARED SURVEY; VARIABILITY; CATALOG; DISKS; TELESCOPE; ALGORITHM; ACCRETION	We report the discovery of eclipses by circumstellar disc material associated with the young star PDS 110 in the Ori OB1a association using the SuperWASP and Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope surveys. PDS 110 (HD 290380, IRAS 05209-0107) is a rare Fe/Ge-type star, an similar to 10 Myr-old accreting intermediate-mass star showing strong infrared excess (L-IR/L-bol similar or equal to 0.25). Two extremely similar eclipses with a depth of 30 per cent and duration similar to 25 d were observed in 2008 November and 2011 January. We interpret the eclipses as caused by the same structure with an orbital period of 808 +/- 2 d. Shearing over a single orbit rules out diffuse dust clumps as the cause, favouring the hypothesis of a companion at similar to 2 au. The characteristics of the eclipses are consistent with transits by an unseen low-mass (1.8-70M(Jup)) planet or brown dwarf with a circumsecondary disc of diameter similar to 0.3 au. The next eclipse event is predicted to take place in 2017 September and could be monitored by amateur and professional observatories across the world.	[Osborn, H. P.; Armstrong, D. J.; Pollacco, D.

J	Menzies, T; Yang, Y; Mathew, G; Boehm, B; Hihn, J				Menzies, Tim; Yang, Ye; Mathew, George; Boehm, Barry; Hihn, Jairus			Negative results for software effort estimation	EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Effort estimation; COCOMO; CART; Nearest neighbor; Clustering; Feature selection; Prototype generation; Bootstrap sampling; Effect size; A12	PREDICTION; LESSONS	More than half the literature on software effort estimation (SEE) focuses on comparisons of new estimation methods. Surprisingly, there are no studies comparing state of the art latest methods with decades-old approaches. Accordingly, this paper takes five steps to check if new SEE methods generated better estimates than older methods. Firstly, collect effort estimation methods ranging from "classical" COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of attributes) to "modern" (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering plus instance and feature selection, and a recent "baseline method" proposed in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering). Secondly, catalog the list of objections that lead to the development of post-COCOMO estimation methods. Thirdly, characterize each of those objections as a comparison between newer and older estimation methods. Fourthly, using four COCOMO-style data sets (from 1991, 2000, 2005, 2010) and run those comparisons experiments. Fifthly, compare the performance of the different estimators using a Scott-Knott procedure using (i) the A12 effect size to rule out "small" differences and (ii) a 99 % confident bootstrap procedure to check for statistically different groupings of treatments. The major negative result of this paper is that for the COCOMO data sets, nothing we studied did any better than Boehms original procedure. Hence, we conclude that when COCOMO-style attributes are available, we strongly recommend (i) using that data and (ii) use COCOMO to generate predictions. We say this since the experiments of this paper show that, at least for effort estimation, how data is collected is more important than what learner is applied to that data.

J	Morishima, R; Turner, N; Spilker, L				Morishima, Ryuji; Turner, Neal; Spilker, Linda			Surface roughness of Saturn's rings and ring particles inferred from thermal phase curves	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn; Rings; Infrared observations; Radiative transfer	SELF-GRAVITY WAKES; COMPOSITE INFRARED SPECTROMETER; DENSE COLLISIONAL SYSTEMS; CASSINI-CIRS; MAIN RINGS; B-RING; BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MULTILAYER MODEL	We analyze thermal phase curves of all the main rings of Saturn (the A, B, C rings, and the Cassini division) measured by both the far-IR and mid-IR detectors of the Cassini Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS). All the rings show temperature increases toward zero phase angle, known as an opposition effect or thermal beaming. For the C ring and Cassini division, which have low optical depths, intra-particle shadowing is considered the dominant mechanism causing the effect. On the other hand, the phase curves of the optically thick B and A rings steepen significantly with decreasing absolute solar elevation angle from 21 to 14, suggesting inter-particle shadowing plays an important role in these rings. We employ an analytic roughness model to estimate the degrees of surface roughness of the rings or ring particles. For optically thin rings, an isolated particle covered by spherical segment craters is employed while for the thick rings we approximate a packed particle layer as a slab covered by craters. The particles in the thin rings are found to have generally rough surfaces, except in the middle C ring. Across the C ring, the optical depth correlates with the degree of surface roughness. This may indicate that surface roughness comes mainly from particle clumping, while individual particles have rather smooth surfaces. For the optically thick rings, the surface roughness of the particle layer is found to be moderate. The modeled phase curves of optically thick rings are shallow if the phase angle change is primarily due to change of observer azimuthal angle. On the other hand, the phase curves are steep if the phase angle change is due to change of observer elevation angle, as inter -particle shadows become visible at higher observer elevation. In addition, the area of shadowed facets increases with decreasing solar elevation angle. These combined effects explain the large seasonal change of the phase curve steepness observed for the thick rings. The degrees of surface roughness inferred from the thermal phase curves are generally less than those from the phase curves in visible light. This is probably explained by different roughness scales seen in thermal and visible light or by dilution of thermal phase curve steepnesses due to particle motion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the information from multiple clinical scales has classification power for identifying actual suicide attempts. Patients with depression and anxiety disorders (N = 573) were included, and each participant completed 31 self-report psychiatric scales and questionnaires about their history of suicide attempts. We then trained an artificial neural network classifier with 41 variables (31 psychiatric scales and 10 sociodemographic elements) and ranked the contribution of each variable for the classification of suicide attempts. To evaluate the clinical applicability of our model, we measured classification performance with top-ranked predictors. Our model had an overall accuracy of 93.7% in 1-month, 90.8% in 1-year, and 87.4% in lifetime suicide attempts detection. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was the highest for 1-month suicide attempts detection (0.93), followed by lifetime (0.89), and 1-year detection (0.87). Among all variables, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire had the highest contribution, and the positive and negative characteristics of the scales similarly contributed to classification performance. Performance on suicide attempts classification was largely maintained when we only used the top five ranked variables for training (AUROC; 1-month, 0.75, 1-year, 0.85, lifetime suicide attempts detection, 0.87). Our findings indicate that information from self-report clinical scales can be useful for the classification of suicide attempts. Based on the reliable performance of the top five predictors alone, this machine learning approach could help clinicians identify high-risk patients in clinical settings.

Although the consensus sequence motif has been identified and used to explain substrate specificity for PKC alpha, it does not inform the structural basis of substrate-binding and kinase activity for diverse substrates phosphorylated by this kinase. The transient, dynamic, and unstructured nature of this protein-protein interaction has limited structural mapping of kinase-substrate interfaces. Here, using multiscale MD simulation-based predictions and FRET sensor-based experiments, we investigated the conformational dynamics of the kinase-substrate interface. We found that the binding strength of the kinase-substrate interaction is primarily determined by long-range columbic interactions between basic (Arg/Lys) residues located N-terminally to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues in the substrate and by an acidic patch in the kinase catalytic domain. Kinase activity stemmed from conformational flexibility in the region C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues. Flexibility of the substrate-kinase interaction enabled an Arg/Lys two to three amino acids C-terminal to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr to prime a catalytically active conformation, facilitating phosphoryl transfer to the substrate. The structural mechanisms determining substrate binding and catalytic activity formed the basis of diverse binding affinities and kinase activities of PKC alpha for 14 substrates with varying degrees of sequence conservation. Our findings provide insight into the dynamic properties of the kinase-substrate interaction that govern substrate binding and turnover. Moreover, this study establishes a modeling and experimental method to elucidate the structural dynamics underlying substrate selectivity among eukaryotic kinases.

Scalable development of quantum network nodes requires on-chip qubit storage functionality with control of the readout time. We demonstrate a high-fidelity nanophotonic quantum memory based on a mesoscopic neodymium ensemble coupled to a photonic crystal cavity. The nanocavity enables > 95% spin polarization for efficient initialization of the atomic frequency comb memory and time bin-selective readout through an enhanced optical Stark shift of the comb frequencies. Our solid-state memory is integrable with other chip-scale photon source and detector devices for multiplexed quantum and classical information processing at the network nodes.

Radar sounder evidence of thick, porous sediments in Meridiani Planum and implications for ice-filled deposits on Mars	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; MARSIS; Meridiani Planum; electrical properties; compaction; water ice	MEDUSAE FOSSAE FORMATION; TERRA MERIDIANI; SUBSURFACE; STRATIGRAPHY; SOUNDINGS; PLANITIA; RECORD; WATER	Meridiani Planum is one of the most intensely studied regions on Mars, yet little is known about the physical properties of the deposits below those examined by the Opportunity rover. We report the detection of subsurface echoes within the Meridiani Planum deposits from data obtained by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) instrument. The delay time between the surface and subsurface returns is indicative of materials with a real dielectric constant of 3.6 +/- 0.6. The real dielectric constant is strongly modulated by bulk density. Newly derived compaction relationships for Mars indicate that the relatively low dielectric constant of the Meridiani Planum deposits is consistent with a thick layer of ice-free, porous, basaltic sand. The unique physiographic and hydrologic setting of Meridiani Planum may have provided an ideal sediment trap for eolian sands. The relatively low gravity and the cold, dry climate that has dominated Mars for billions of years may have allowed thick eolian sand deposits to remain porous and only weakly indurated. Minimally compacted sedimentary deposits may offer a possible explanation for other nonpolar region units with low apparent bulk dielectric constants. Plain Language Summary In spite of being among the most intensely studied regions of Mars, little is known about the makeup of the Meridiani Planum deposits below those examined by the Opportunity rover. The MARSIS radar sounder has detected subsurface echoes in Meridiani Planum. MARSIS transmits low-frequency radio pulses that can penetrate into certain crustal materials and are reflected back by dielectric discontinuities related to physical or compositional changes. Subsurface reflectors that are significantly offset in time delay from surface returns are interpreted to be from the interface between the Meridiani Planum deposits and buried ancient cratered terrain. The time delay is consistent with a material having a relatively low dielectric constant. Deposits on Mars with low dielectric constants are generally interpreted to indicate the presence of substantial water ice. The dielectric constant is strongly influenced by bulk density, and a thick sedimentary deposit will undergo significant self-compaction without the presence of pore-filling ice, increasing in bulk density and dielectric constant. Newly derived compaction relationships for Mars indicate that the relatively low dielectric constant of the Meridiani Planum deposits is consistent with a thick sequence of ice-free, porous, eolian sand. Thus, low dielectric constants are possible in other nonpolar deposits without the presence of water ice.

Io-Jupiter decametric arcs observed by Juno/Waves compared to ExPRES simulations	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Juno; Waves; ExPRES; Jupiter; Io; radio; decametric	RADIO EMISSIONS	We compare observations from the Juno/Waves radio experiment with simulations of radio << arcs >> in the time-frequency plane resulting from the Io-Jupiter interaction, performed with the ExPRES code. We identify the hemisphere of origin of the observed arcs directly from simulations and confirm this identification through comparison with Juno, Nancay, and Wind observations. The occurrence and shape of observed arcs are well modeled, at low latitudes with their usual shapes as seen from Earth, as well as at high latitudes with longer, bowl-shaped, arcs observed for the first time. Predicted emission is actually observed only when the radio beaming angle O = (k,B) >= 70 degrees +/- 5 degrees, providing new constraints on the generation of the decameter emission by the Cyclotron Maser Instability. Further improvements of ExPRES are outlined, which will then be applied to Juno and Earth-based observations of radio emissions induced by other Galilean satellites or associated to the main auroral oval.

Ravi; Gasparini, Blaz; Li, Jui-Lin Frank			Potential impact of carbonaceous aerosol on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and precipitation during Asian summer monsoon in a global model simulation	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPICAL TROPOPAUSE LAYER; BLACK CARBON; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; WATER-VAPOR; PEROXYACETYL NITRATE; TRANSPORT PATHWAYS; CIRRUS CLOUDS; HUMAN HEALTH; SOUTH-ASIA; CLIMATE	Recent satellite observations show efficient vertical transport of Asian pollutants from the surface to the upper-level anticyclone by deep monsoon convection. In this paper, we examine the transport of carbonaceous aerosols, including black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), into the monsoon anticyclone using of ECHAM6-HAM, a global aerosol climate model. Further, we investigate impacts of enhanced (doubled) carbonaceous aerosol emissions on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), underneath monsoon circulation and precipitation from sensitivity simulations. The model simulation shows that boundary layer aerosols are transported into the monsoon anticyclone by the strong monsoon convection from the Bay of Bengal, southern slopes of the Himalayas and the South China Sea. Doubling of emissions of both BC and OC aerosols over Southeast Asia (10 degrees S-50 degrees N, 65-155 degrees E) shows that lofted aerosols produce significant warming (0.6-1 K) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) near 400-200 hPa and instability in the middle/upper troposphere. These aerosols enhance radiative heating rates (0.02-0.03K day(-1)) near the tropopause. The enhanced carbonaceous aerosols alter aerosol radiative forcing (RF) at the surface by -4.74 +/- 1.42Wm(-2), at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by +0.37 +/- 0.26W m(-2) and in the atmosphere by + 5.11 +/- 0.83Wm(-2) over the TP and Indo-Gangetic Plain region (15-35 degrees N, 80-110 degrees E). Atmospheric warming increases vertical velocities and thereby cloud ice in the upper troposphere. Aerosol induced anomalous warming over the TP facilitates the relative strengthening of the monsoon Hadley circulation and increases moisture inflow by strengthening the cross-equatorial monsoon jet. This increases precipitation amounts over India (1-4mm day(-1)) and eastern China (0.2-2mm day(-1)). These results are significant at the 99% confidence level.

The observations reveal regions containing magnetic field aligned beams of bidirectional electrons having broad energy distributions interspersed between beams of upward electrons with narrow, peaked energy distributions, regions void of these electrons, and regions dominated by penetrating radiation. The electrons show evidence of acceleration via parallel electric fields (inverted-V structures) and via stochastic processes (bidirectional distributions). The inverted-V structures shown here were observed from similar to 1.4 to 2.9 R-J and had spatial scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometers along Juno's trajectory. The upward electron energy flux was typically greater than the downward flux, the latter ranging between similar to 0.01 and 5 mW m(-2) for two cases shown here which we estimate could produce similar to 0.1-50 kR of ultraviolet emission. Plain Language Summary We report on observations of 0.1 - 100 kilo-electron volt electrons from the Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment Electron instrument (JADE-E) on Juno over the region where Jupiter's ultraviolet (UV) polar aurora is produced. The observations show electrons moving both towards and away from Jupiter. These electrons show both broad and narrow energy distributions, suggesting the presence of at least two different acceleration mechanisms. Regions void of these electrons and regions dominated by penetrating radiation were also identified. The energy flux of the electrons moving towards Jupiter was sufficient to produce the weaker UV polar auroral emissions observed at Jupiter but a different source of electrons, likely with higher energies, is required to account for the brighter emissions.

An Assessment of Ground Level and Free Tropospheric Ozone Over California and Nevada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							TABLE MOUNTAIN FACILITY; WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; BASE-LINE OZONE; SURFACE OZONE; AIR-QUALITY; UNITED-STATES; AIRBORNE MEASUREMENTS; EXCEEDANCE AREA; MIXING RATIOS; TERM CHANGES	Increasing free tropospheric ozone (O-3), combined with the high elevation and often deep boundary layers at western U.S. surface stations, poses challenges in attaining the more stringent 70 ppb O-3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard. As such, use of observational data to identify sources and mechanisms that contribute to surface O-3 is increasingly important. This work analyzes surface and vertical O-3 observations over California and Nevada from 1995 to 2015. Over this period, the number of high O-3 events (95th percentile) at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) sites has decreased during summer, as a result of decreasing U.S. emissions. In contrast, an increase in springtime 5th percentile O-3 indicates a general increase of baseline O-3. During 2012 there was a peak in exceedances and in the average spring-summer O-3 mixing ratios at CASTNET sites. Goddard Earth Observing System-Chem results show that the surface O-3 attributable to transport from the upper troposphere and stratosphere was increased in 2013 compared to 2012, highlighting the importance of measurements aloft. Vertical O-3 measurements from aircraft, ozonesondes, and lidar show distinct seasonal trends, with a high percentage of elevated O-3 laminae (O-3 > 70 ppb, 3-8 km) during spring and summer. Analysis of the timing of high O-3 surface events and correlation between surface and vertical O-3 data is used to discuss varying sources of western U.S. surface O-3.	[Yates, E. L.; Iraci, L.

Variability of Stratospheric Reactive Nitrogen and Ozone Related to the QBO	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							QUASI-BIENNIAL OSCILLATION; CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODEL; ODIN-OSIRIS; 2-DIMENSIONAL MODEL; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; SAGE-II; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; TROPICAL OZONE; TRACE GASES; NO2	The stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dominates interannual variability of dynamical variables and trace constituents in the tropical stratosphere and provides a natural experiment to test circulation-chemistry interactions. This work quantifies the relationships among ozone (O-3), reactive nitrogen (NOy), and source gas N2O, and their links to the QBO, based on satellite constituent measurements and meteorological data spanning 2005-2014 (over four QBO cycles). Data include O-3, HNO3, and N2O from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder and an NOx proxy derived from Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System NO2 measurements combined with a photochemical box model (= NOx*). Results are compared to simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, version 4 incorporating a QBO circulation nudged to assimilated winds. Cross correlations and composites with respect to the QBO phase show coherent 180 degrees out-of-phase relationships between NOy and N2O throughout the stratosphere, with the NOx/HNO3 ratio increasing with altitude. The anomalies in NOy species propagate coherently downward with the QBO. Ozone is anticorrelated with reactive nitrogen in the middle stratosphere above similar to 28 km due to NOx control of ozone catalytic loss cycles. Quantitative comparisons of nitrogen partitioning and O-3 sensitivity to NOx show good overall agreement between satellite observations and model results (suggesting closure of the NOy budget), although the model results show larger (up to similar to 20%) N2O, NOx, and O-3 variations near similar to 35 km compared to observations. These analyses serve to assess the consistency of diverse satellite-based data sets and also to evaluate nitrogen partitioning and NOx-dependent ozone chemistry in the global model.

Reanalysis comparisons of upper tropospheric-lower stratospheric jets and multiple tropopauses	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; COLUMN OZONE; ERA-INTERIM; PRECIPITATION; ASSIMILATION; CIRCULATION; STREAM; MERRA; EXPANSION	The representation of upper tropospheric-lower stratospheric (UTLS) jet and tropopause characteristics is compared in five modern high-resolution reanalyses for 1980 through 2014. Climatologies of upper tropospheric jet, subvortex jet (the lowermost part of the stratospheric vortex), and multiple tropopause frequency distributions in MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications), ERA-I (ERA-Interim; the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts, ECMWF, interim reanalysis), JRA-55 (the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis), and CFSR (the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) are compared with those in MERRA-2. Differences between alternate products from individual reanalysis systems are assessed; in particular, a comparison of CFSR data on model and pressure levels highlights the importance of vertical grid spacing. Most of the differences in distributions of UTLS jets and multiple tropopauses are consistent with the differences in assimilation model grids and resolution - for example, ERA-I (with coarsest native horizontal resolution) typically shows a significant low bias in upper tropospheric jets with respect to MERRA-2, and JRA-55 (the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis) a more modest one, while CFSR (with finest native horizontal resolution) shows a high bias with respect to MERRA-2 in both upper tropospheric jets and multiple tropopauses. Vertical temperature structure and grid spacing are especially important for multiple tropopause characterizations. Substantial differences between MERRA and MERRA-2 are seen in mid-to high-latitude Southern Hemisphere (SH) winter upper tropospheric jets and multiple tropopauses as well as in the upper tropospheric jets associated with tropical circulations during the solstice seasons; some of the largest differences from the other reanalyses are seen in the same times and places. Very good qualitative agreement among the reanalyses is seen between the large-scale climatological features in UTLS jet and multiple tropopause distributions. Quantitative differences may, however, have important consequences for transport and variability studies. Our results highlight the importance of considering reanalyses differences in UTLS studies, especially in relation to resolution and model grids; this is particularly critical when using high-resolution reanalyses as an observational reference for evaluating global chemistry-climate models.

As a result of the growing world population and the recognition of the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, this anthropogenic source of CH4 has received much recent attention. However, the accurate assessment of the CH4 emissions from landfills by modeling and existing measurement techniques is challenging. This is because of inaccurate knowledge of the model parameters and the extent of and limited accessibility to landfill sites. This results in a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the emissions of CH4 from landfills and waste management. In this study, we present results derived from data collected during the research campaign COMEX (CO2 and MEthane eXperiment) in late summer 2014 in the Los Angeles (LA) Basin. One objective of COMEX, which comprised aircraft observations of methane by the remote sensing Methane Airborne MAPper (MAMAP) instrument and a Picarro greenhouse gas in situ analyzer, was the quantitative investigation of CH4 emissions. Enhanced CH4 concentrations or "CH4 plumes" were detected downwind of landfills by remote sensing aircraft surveys. Subsequent to each remote sensing survey, the detected plume was sampled within the atmospheric boundary layer by in situ measurements of atmospheric parameters such as wind information and dry gas mixing ratios of CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the same aircraft. This was undertaken to facilitate the independent estimation of the surface fluxes for the validation of the remote sensing estimates. During the COMEX campaign, four landfills in the LA Basin were surveyed. One landfill repeatedly showed a clear emission plume. This landfill, the Olinda Alpha Landfill, was investigated on 4 days during the last week of August and first days of September 2014. Emissions were estimated for all days using a mass balance approach. The derived emissions vary between 11.6 and 17.8 ktCH(4) yr 1 with related uncertainties in the range of 14 to 45 %. The comparison of the remote sensing and in situ based CH4 emission rate estimates reveals good agreement within the error bars with an average of the absolute differences of around 2.4 ktCH(4) yr 1 (+/- 2.8 kt CH4 yr(-1)). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported inventory value is 11.5 ktCH(4) yr(-1) for 2014, on average 2.8 ktCH(4) yr(-1) (+/- 1.6 ktCH(4) yr(-1)) lower than our estimates acquired in the afternoon in late summer 2014. This difference may in part be explained by a possible leak located on the southwestern slope of the landfill, which we identified in the observations of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) instrument, flown contemporaneously aboard a second aircraft on 1 day.

The Very Low Albedo of WASP-12b from Spectral Eclipse Observations with Hubble	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; stars: individual (WASP-12); techniques: photometric	OPTICAL-PHASE CURVES; HD 189733B; PLANETARY ATMOSPHERE; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; PHOTOMETRY; CLOUDS	We present an optical eclipse observation of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. These spectra allow us to place an upper limit of A(g) < 0.064 (97.5% confidence level) on the planet's white light geometric albedo across 290-570 nm. Using six wavelength bins across the same wavelength range also produces stringent limits on the geometric albedo for all bins. However, our uncertainties in eclipse depth are similar to 40% greater than the Poisson limit and may be limited by the intrinsic variability of the Sun-like host star-the solar luminosity is known to vary at the 10(-4) level on a timescale of minutes. We use our eclipse depth limits to test two previously suggested atmospheric models for this planet: Mie scattering from an aluminum-oxide haze or cloud-free Rayleigh scattering. Our stringent nondetection rules out both models and is consistent with thermal emission plus weak Rayleigh scattering from atomic hydrogen and helium. Our results are in stark contrast with those for the much cooler HD 189733b, the only other hot Jupiter with spectrally resolved reflected light observations; those data showed an increase in albedo with decreasing wavelength. The fact that the first two exoplanets with optical albedo spectra exhibit significant differences demonstrates the importance of spectrally resolved reflected light observations and highlights the great diversity among hot Jupiters.

The GCP dataset integrates results from top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry), inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven approaches. The annual global methane emissions from top-down studies, which by construction match the observed methane growth rate within their uncertainties, all show an increase in total methane emissions over the period 2000-2012, but this increase is not linear over the 13 years. Despite differences between individual studies, the mean emission anomaly of the top-down ensemble shows no significant trend in total methane emissions over the period 2000-2006, during the plateau of atmospheric methane mole fractions, and also over the period 2008-2012, during the renewed atmospheric methane increase. However, the top-down ensemble mean produces an emission shift between 2006 and 2008, leading to 22 [16-32] Tg CH4 yr(-1) higher methane emissions over the period 2008-2012 compared to 2002-2006. This emission increase mostly originated from the tropics, with a smaller contribution from mid-latitudes and no significant change from boreal regions. The regional contributions remain uncertain in top-down studies. Tropical South America and South and East Asia seem to contribute the most to the emission increase in the tropics. However, these two regions have only limited atmospheric measurements and remain therefore poorly constrained. The sectorial partitioning of this emission increase between the periods 2002-2006 and 2008-2012 differs from one atmospheric inversion study to another. However, all top-down studies suggest smaller changes in fossil fuel emissions (from oil, gas, and coal industries) compared to the mean of the bottom-up inventories included in this study. This difference is partly driven by a smaller emission change in China from the top-down studies compared to the estimate in the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGARv4.2) inventory, which should be revised to smaller values in a near future. We apply isotopic signatures to the emission changes estimated for individual studies based on five emission sectors and find that for six individual top-down studies (out of eight) the average isotopic signature of the emission changes is not consistent with the observed change in atmospheric (CH4)-C-13. However, the partitioning in emission change derived from the ensemble mean is consistent with this isotopic constraint. At the global scale, the top-down ensemble mean suggests that the dominant contribution to the resumed atmospheric CH4 growth after 2006 comes from microbial sources (more from agriculture and waste sectors than from natural wetlands), with an uncertain but smaller contribution from fossil CH4 emissions. In addition, a decrease in biomass burning emissions (in agreement with the biomass burning emission databases) makes the balance of sources consistent with atmospheric (CH4)-C-13 observations. In most of the top-down studies included here, OH concentrations are considered constant over the years (seasonal variations but without any inter-annual variability). As a result, the methane loss (in particular through OH oxidation) varies mainly through the change in methane concentrations and not its oxidants. For these reasons, changes in the methane loss could not be properly investigated in this study, although it may play a significant role in the recent atmospheric methane changes as briefly discussed at the end of the paper.

First look at Jupiter's synchrotron emission from Juno's perspective	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RADIATION BELTS; RADIO IMAGES; MODEL; POLARIZATION; ELECTRONS	Since August 2016, measurements of Jupiter's microwave emissions at six wavelengths ranging from 1.3 cm to 50 cm have been made with the Juno Microwave Radiometer. In this paper, we introduce the first systematic set of in situ observations of synchrotron radiation in a polar plane while describing the modeling approach we use to analyze this data (collected 27 August 2016). Time series of brightness profiles at all six frequencies present similarities that are explained by the presence of known regions of intense synchrotron radiation. Our model predictions, though limited for now to the total intensity of the radiation, reproduce (qualitatively) the observation of temporal variations and allow to disentangle the synchrotron emission from the atmospheric emission. The discrepancies seen between the data and simulations confirm that physical conditions close to Jupiter affecting synchrotron emission (electron energy spectra, pitch angle distributions, and the magnetic environment) are different than we anticipated.

J	Hsu, CW; Velicogna, I				Hsu, Chia-Wei; Velicogna, Isabella			Detection of sea level fingerprints derived from GRACE gravity data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SATELLITE ALTIMETRY; MASS-BALANCE; POLE TIDE; OCEAN; RISE; ANTARCTICA; PATTERNS	Mass changes of ice sheets, glaciers and ice caps, land water hydrology, atmosphere, and ocean cause a nonuniform sea level rise due to the self-attraction and loading effects called sea level fingerprints (SLF). SLF have been previously derived from a combination of modeled and observed mass fluxes from the continents into the ocean. Here we derive improved SLF from time series of time variable gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission for April 2002 to October 2014. We evaluate the GRACE-derived SLF using ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from stations in the tropics, where OBP errors are the lowest. We detect the annual phase of the SLF in the OBP signal and separate it unambiguously from the barystatic sea level (BSL) at two stations. At the basin scale, the SLF explain a larger fraction of the variance in steric-corrected altimetry than the BSL, which has implications for evaluating mass transport between ocean basins. Plain Language Summary As ice sheets and glaciers and ice caps melt into the ocean, the pattern of regional sea level rise is nonuniform and tracked via the sea level fingerprints. Here we provide the first observational evidence that the SLF calculated from satellite observations match the record from ocean stations that measure mass changes over time, i.e., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-based satellite technique correctly captures the distribution of freshwater fluxes to the ocean and the signal is large enough to be detected by ocean in situ observations in the tropics. The results are critical to improve regional projections of sea level rise and its impact on coastlines and human systems.

Energetic particle signatures of magnetic field-aligned potentials over Jupiter's polar regions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							PARALLEL ELECTRIC-FIELDS; AURORAL CURRENT REGION; X-RAY-EMISSION; BIRKELAND CURRENTS; MAGNETOSPHERE; IONOSPHERE; BEAMS; COROTATION; FLUX	Recent results of the first ever orbit through Jupiter's auroral region by NASA's Juno spacecraft did not show evidence of coherent acceleration in the auroral or polar region. However, in this letter, we show energetic particle data from Juno's Jupiter Energetic-particle Detector Instrument instrument during the third auroral pass that exhibits conclusive evidence of downward parallel electric fields in portions of Jupiter's polar region. The energetic particle distributions show inverted-V ion and electron structures in a downward electric current region with accelerated peaked distributions in hundreds of keV to similar to 1MeV range. The origin of these large electric potential structures is investigated and discussed within the current theoretical framework of current-voltage relationships at both Earth and Jupiter. Parallel electric fields responsible for accelerating particles to maintain the aurora/magnetospheric circuit appear to be a common phenomenon among strongly magnetized planets with conducting ionospheres; however, their origin and generation mechanisms are subjects of ongoing research.

The stability of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) influences the exchange of turbulent energy. We explore the differences in over-lake ABL stability using data from 39 globally distributed lakes. The frequency of unstable ABL conditions varied between lakes from 71 to 100% of the time, with average air temperatures typically several degrees below the average lake surface temperature. This difference increased with decreasing latitude, resulting in a more frequently unstable ABL and a more efficient energy transfer to and from the atmosphere, toward the tropics. In addition, during summer the frequency of unstable ABL conditions decreased with increasing lake surface area. The dependency of ABL stability on latitude and lake size has implications for heat loss and carbon fluxes from lakes, the hydrologic cycle, and climate change effects.	[Woolway, R.

J	Gleyzes, J				Gleyzes, Jerome			Parametrizing modified gravity for cosmological surveys	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DARK ENERGY	One of the challenges in testing gravity with cosmology is the vast freedom opened when extending General Relativity. For linear perturbations, one solution consists in using the effective field theory of dark energy. Even then, the theory space is described in terms of a handful of free functions of time. This needs to be reduced to a finite number of parameters to be practical for cosmological surveys. We explore in this article how well simple parametrizations, with a small number of parameters, can fit observables computed from complex theories. Imposing the stability of linear perturbations appreciably reduces the theory space we explore. We find that observables are not extremely sensitive to short time-scale variations and that simple, smooth parametrizations are usually sufficient to describe this theory space. Using the Bayesian information criterion, we find that using two parameters for each function (an amplitude and a power-law index) is preferred over complex models for 86% of our theory space.

At the time of observation, Kraken and Ligeia were confined within root-mean-square heights of 1.5-2.5 mm (similar to wave heights of 6-10 mm), correlation lengths of 45-115 mm, and corresponding to effective slopes of 1.1-2.4 degrees. The latter extends up to 3.6-4.9 degrees if the rougher Punga is included. The lower bound of those ranges has to be considered if the composition of the seas is methane-dominant. These are the first measurements to simultaneously constrain both the vertical and horizontal roughness parameters of Titan's seas from the same observations. Our results are representative for the global properties of the sea-scaled portion of the studied tracks and suggest that quiet surfaces are a dominant trend over the seas during the northern early summer. Fields of rougher textures, if existent, might develop mainly over local patches and/or might not be sustained over significant periods of time. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Extreme fractionation (20-30%) within each single crystal studied here confirms that Li diffusion commonly occurs in zircon. Sharp Li concentration gradients frequently seen in zircons suggest that the effective diffusivity of Li is significantly slower than experimentally determined (Cherniak and Watson, 2010; Trail et al., 2016), otherwise the crystallization/metamorphic heating of these zircons would have to be unrealistically fast (years to tens of years). Charge coupling with REE and Y has been suggested as a mechanism that may considerably reduce Li diffusivity in zircon (Ushikubo et al., 2008; Bouvier et al., 2012). We show that Li diffused in the direction of decreasing Li/Y ratio and increasing Li concentration (uphill diffusion) in one of the zircons, demonstrating charge coupling with REE and Y. Quantitative modeling reveals that Li may diffuse in at least two modes in natural zircons: one being slow and possibly coupled with REE+Y, and the other one being fast and not coupled with REE+Y. The partitioning of Li between these two modes during its diffusion may depend on the pre-diffusion substitution mechanism of REE and Y in the zircon lattice. Based on our results, sharp Li concentration gradients are not indicative of limited diffusion, and can be preserved at temperatures >700 degrees C on geologic timescales. Finally, large delta Li-7 variations observed in the Hadean Jack Hills zircons may record kinetic fractionation, rather than a record of ancient intense weathering in the granite source materials.

Exposure age of Saturn's A and B rings, and the Cassini Division as suggested by their non-icy material content	ICARUS			English	Article							SELF-GRAVITY WAKES; MICROWAVE OBSERVATIONS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; LIGHT-SCATTERING; SYSTEM; DENSITY; ORIGIN; RADAR	Saturn's rings are composed primarily of water ice with a small fraction of non-icy constituents that are likely both intrinsic and extrinsic in origin. The intrinsic material is thought to be characteristic of the ring progenitor, while the extrinsic material is derived from the continual stream of hypervelocity impacting micrometeoroids that pollute the rings over time. Thus constraining these relative volume fractions and their radial distribution provides a powerful tool by which one can reveal clues about the rings' ultimate origin and age. In this companion to our first paper for the C ring (Zhang et al., 2017), we present new measurements of the non-icy material fraction in Saturn's B ring, Cassini Division and A ring as determined from microwave radiometry observations acquired by the Cassini spacecraft. We investigate the near-zero azimuthal angle observations and demonstrate a radially varying scattering phase function for B ring particles which transitions from half-Mie-half-isotropic in the inner and outer B ring to purely isotropic in the middle B ring. This variation follows the trend of the optical depth in that as the optical depth increases, more particles scatter isotropically. In the A ring radially inward of the Encke gap, we find that the phase function can vary from purely isotropic for 55% porous particles to a combination of 30% Mie/70% isotropic for porosities of 90%, while outwards of the Encke gap particles are most likely 90% porous and scatter light isotropically. We derive the non-icy material fractions, assuming silicate as the non-icy material, and show that there is a significant dependence on the assumed porosity in the B ring, but the radial distribution follows the same trend as the optical depth. Owing to the B ring's high opacity (i.e. high optical depth but low surface density), the particles there are likely to have 85%-90% porosity, with corresponding non-icy volume fractions of similar to 03%-0.5% in the inner and outer B ring, and similar to 0.1%-0.2% in the middle regions. For the A ring interior to the Encke gap, the derived non-icy material volume fraction is similar to 0.2%-0.3% everywhere for porosities ranging from 55%-90%. Finally, our results for the Cassini Division indicate a non-icy material fraction of similar to 1%-2% similar to most regions in the C ring, except that the Cassini Division particles are more likely to have a porosity greater than or similar to 90% due to the high opacity there. We find that the overall pollution exposure time for the A and B rings and the Cassini Division ranges from similar to 30-150 Myr, which is in line with the similar to 15-90 Myr we previously derived for most regions in the C ring. These exposure times assume an initially nearly pure-ice ring that has been continuously contaminated by in-falling micrometeoroids since its formation, using the currently accepted value of the micrometeoroid flux (Gain et al., 1985; Cuzzi and Estrada, 1998; Kempf et al., 2013; Altobelli et al., 2015). Our results here, taken together with our previous findings for the C ring, further support the idea that Saturn's rings may be less than or similar to 150 Myr old suggesting an origin scenario in which the rings are derived from the relatively recent breakup of an icy moon.

Discrete cohesionless granular physics model	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids, dynamics; Asteroids, rotation; Geological processes	RUBBLE-PILE ASTEROIDS; SHEAR-BAND DEVELOPMENT; ELEMENT METHOD; ROLLING RESISTANCE; EQUILIBRIUM SHAPES; SPIN-UP; ROTATIONAL FISSION; BINARY ASTEROIDS; SOLAR-SYSTEM; NEAR-EARTH	As the target of the proposed Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, the near-Earth binary asteroid 65803 Didymos represents a special class of binary asteroids, those whose primaries are at risk of rotational disruption. To gain a better understanding of these binary systems and to support the AIDA mission, this paper investigates the creep stability of the Didymos primary by representing it as a cohesionless self-gravitating granular aggregate subject to rotational acceleration. To achieve this goal, a soft-sphere discrete element model (SSDEM) capable of simulating granular systems in quasi-static states is implemented and a quasi-static spin-up procedure is carried out. We devise three critical spin limits for the simulated aggregates to indicate their critical states triggered by reshaping and surface shedding, internal structural deformation, and shear failure, respectively. The failure condition and mode, and shear strength of an aggregate can all be inferred from the three critical spin limits. The effects of arrangement and size distribution of constituent particles, bulk density, spin-up path, and interparticle friction are numerically explored. The results show that the shear strength of a spinning self-gravitating aggregate depends strongly on both its internal configuration and material parameters, while its failure mode and mechanism are mainly affected by its internal configuration. Additionally, this study provides some constraints on the possible physical properties of the Didymos primary based on observational data and proposes a plausible formation mechanism for this binary system. With a bulk density consistent with observational uncertainty and close to the maximum density allowed for the asteroid, the Didymos primary in certain configurations can remain geo-statically stable without requiring cohesion.

Pit chains on Enceladus signal the recent tectonic dissection of the ancient cratered terrains	ICARUS			English	Article						Tectonics; Saturnian satellites; Enceladus; Fractures and faults	SOUTH-POLAR TERRAIN; SURFACE; MORPHOLOGY; ERUPTIONS; ICELAND; VOLCANO; ORIGIN; EROS	Enceladus is the first outer solar system body on which pit chains have been positively identified. We map the global distribution of pit chains and show that pit chains are among the youngest tectonic features on Enceladus's surface, concentrated in the cratered plains centered on Enceladus's Saturnian and anti-Saturnian hemispheres. Pit chains on Enceladus are interpreted as the surface expressions of subsurface dilational fractures underlying a cover of unconsolidated material, which we infer to be a geologically young cover of loose regolith that mantles the surface of Enceladus. A widespread layer of regolith may act to insulate the surface, which has implications for the thermal state of Enceladus's ice shell. The widespread distribution of pit chains across the cratered plains indicates that this ancient surface has recently been tectonically active. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The impact trajectory of asteroid 2008 TC3	ICARUS			English	Article						Astrometry; Celestial mechanics; Minor planets; Asteroids; Individual (2008 TC3)	RECOVERY; SHAPE	The impact of asteroid 2008 TC3 was an unprecedented event the first ever predicted impact of a near Earth object. When it was first detected about 20 h before impact, 2008 TC3 was still farther away than the Moon. Once it was recognized as an impactor and announced as such, 2008 TC3 began to receive considerable attention from astronomical observers. Using the unprecedented dataset of nearly 900 astrometric observations and the latest observation debiasing and weighting techniques, we estimate the precise trajectory of 2008 TC3 and its impact ground track. At the entry point into the atmosphere, the 3-sigma formal uncertainty in predicted position is an ellipse only 1.4 km x 0.15 km in size. The locations of the many meteorites recovered from the desert floor mark the asteroid's actual ground track and provide a unique opportunity to validate trajectory models. We find that the second-order zonal harmonics of the Earth gravity field moves the ground track by more than 1 km and the location along the ground track by more than 2 km, while non-zonal and higher order harmonics change the impact prediction by less than 20 m. The contribution of atmospheric drag to the trajectory of 2008 TC3 is similar to the numerical integration error level, a few meters, down to an altitude of 50 km. Integrating forward to lower altitudes and ignoring the break-up of 2008 TC3, atmospheric drag causes an along -track deviation that can be as large as a few kilometers at sea level.

Thermally induced stresses in boulders on airless body surfaces, and implications for rock breakdown	ICARUS			English	Article						Geological processes; Moon, surface; Asteroids; Surfaces; Mercury, surface; Regoliths	SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; INCOMPLETE SELF-SIMILARITY; FATIGUE-CRACK-GROWTH; CRATER; LUNAR; MICROCRACKS; PROPAGATION; MERCURY; MARS; MOON	This work investigates the macroscopic thermomechanical behavior of lunar boulders by modeling their response to diurnal thermal forcing. Our results reveal a bimodal, spatiotemporally-complex stress response. During sunrise, stresses occur in the boulders' interiors that are associated with large-scale temperature gradients developed due to overnight cooling. During sunset, stresses occur at the boulders' exteriors due to the cooling and contraction of the surface. Both kinds of stresses are on the order of 10 MPa in 1 m boulders and decrease for smaller diameters, suggesting that larger boulders break down more quickly. Boulders <= 30 cm exhibit a weak response to thermal forcing, suggesting a threshold below which crack propagation may not occur. Boulders of any size buried by regolith are shielded from thermal breakdown. As boulders increase in size (>1 m), stresses increase to several 10 s of MPa as the behavior of their surfaces approaches that of an infinite halfspace. As the thermal wave loses contact with the boulder interior, stresses become limited to the near-surface. This suggests that the survival time of a boulder is not only controlled by the amplitude of induced stress, but also by its diameter as compared to the diurnal skin depth. While stresses on the order of 10 MPa are enough to drive crack propagation in terrestrial environments, crack propagation rates in vacuum are not well constrained. We explore the relationship between boulder size, stress, and the direction of crack propagation, and discuss the implications for the relative breakdown rates and estimated lifetimes of boulders on airless body surfaces.

Depth varying rupture properties during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake	TECTONOPHYSICS			English	Article						Gorkha earthquake; Kinematic rupture process inversion; Joint inversion; Bayesian inversion	THERMAL CONSTRAINTS; COLLISION ZONE; GPS; INVERSION; SLIP; MEGATHRUST; HIMALAYA; MODELS; DISPLACEMENT; DEFORMATION	On April 25th 2015, the Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake ruptured a portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust underlying Kathmandu and surrounding regions. We develop kinematic slip models of the Gorkha earthquake using both a regularized multi-time-window (MTW) approach and an unsmoothed Bayesian formulation, constrained by static and high rate GPS observations, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offset images, interferometric SAR (InSAR), and teleseismic body wave records. These models indicate that Kathmandu is located near the updip limit of fault slip and approximately 20 km south of the centroid of fault slip. Fault slip propagated unilaterally along-strike in an ESE direction for approximately 140 km with a 60 km cross-strike extent. The deeper portions of the fault are characterized by a larger ratio of high frequency (0.03-0.2 Hz) to low frequency slip than the shallower portions. From both the MTW and Bayesian results, we can resolve depth variations in slip characteristics, with higher slip roughness, higher rupture velocity, longer rise time and higher complexity of subfault source time functions in the deeper extents of the rupture. The depth varying nature of rupture characteristics suggests that the up-dip portions are characterized by relatively continuous rupture, while the down-dip portions may be better characterized by a cascaded rupture. The rupture behavior and the tectonic setting indicate that the earthquake may have ruptured both fully seismically locked and a deeper transitional portions of the collision interface, analogous to what has been seen in, major subduction zone earthquakes.

J	Palmer, EM; Heggy, E; Kofman, W				Palmer, Elizabeth M.; Heggy, Essam; Kofman, Wlodek			Orbital bistatic radar observations of asteroid Vesta by the Dawn mission	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR; SURFACE; PLANETARY; POLE	We present orbital bistatic radar observations of a small-body, acquired during occultation by the Dawn spacecraft at asteroid Vesta. The radar forward-scattering properties of different reflection sites are used to assess the textural properties of Vesta's surface at centimeter-to-decimeter scales and are compared to subsurface hydrogen concentrations observed by Dawn's Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector to assess potential volatile occurrence in the surface and shallow subsurface. We observe significant differences in surface radar reflectivity, implying substantial spatial variations in centimeter-to-decimeter-scale surface roughness. Our results suggest that unlike the Moon, Vesta's surface roughness variations cannot be explained by cratering processes only. In particular, the occurrence of heightened hydrogen concentrations within large smoother terrains (over hundreds of square kilometers) suggests that potential ground-ice presence may have contributed to the formation of Vesta's current surface texture. Our observations are consistent with geomorphological evidence of transient water flow from Dawn Framing Camera images.

Near 2 hPa (42 km), ozone has been increasing by about 1.5% per decade in the tropics (20 degrees S to 20 degrees N), and by 2 to 2.5% per decade in the 35 to 60 degrees latitude bands of both hemispheres. At levels below 35 km (5 hPa), 2000 to 2016 ozone trends are smaller and not statistically significant. The observed trend profiles are consistent with expectations from chemistry climate model simulations. This study confirms positive trends of upper stratospheric ozone already reported, e.g., in the WMO/UNEP Ozone Assessment 2014 or by Harris et al. (2015). Compared to those studies, three to four additional years of observations, updated and improved data sets with reduced drift, and the fact that nearly all individual data sets indicate ozone increase in the upper stratosphere, all give enhanced confidence. Uncertainties have been reduced, for example for the trend near 2 hPa in the 35 to 60 ffi latitude bands from about similar to 5% (2 degrees) in Harris et al. (2015) to less than similar to 2% (2 degrees). Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of possible drifts and differences between various data sources is still required, as is a detailed attribution of the observed increases to declining ozone-depleting substances and to stratospheric cooling. Ongoing quality observations from multiple independent platforms are key for verifying that recovery of the ozone layer continues as expected.

We have analyzed the emission-line luminosity functions, reddening, and other diagnostics. For example, the narrow-line regions (NLR) of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies do not significantly differ from each other in most of these diagnostics. Combining the H alpha/H beta ratio with a new reddening indicator-the [S II] 6720/[O II] 3727 ratio-we find the average E(B-V) is 0.49 +/- 0.35 for type 1 and 0.52 +/- 0.26 for type 2 Seyferts. The NLR of Sy 1s has an ionization level insignificantly higher than that of Sy 2s. For the broad-line region (BLR), we find that the C IV equivalent width correlates more strongly with [O III]/H beta than with UV luminosity. Our bright sample of local active galaxies includes 22 Seyfert nuclei with extremely weak broad wings in H alpha, known as Seyfert 1.9s and 1.8s, depending on whether or not broad H beta wings are detected. Aside from these weak broad lines, our low-luminosity Seyferts are more similar to the Sy 2s than to Sy 1s. In a BPT diagram, we find that Sy 1.8s and 1.9s overlap the region occupied by Sy 2s. We compare our results on optical emission lines with those obtained by previous investigators, using AGN subsamples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The luminosity functions of forbidden emission lines [O II]lambda 3727 angstrom, [O III]lambda 5007 angstrom, and [S II]lambda 6720 angstrom in Sy 1s and Sy 2s are indistinguishable. They all show strong downward curvature. Unlike the LFs of Seyfert galaxies measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ours are nearly flat at low luminosities. The larger number of faint Sloan "AGN" is attributable to their inclusion of weakly emitting LINERs and H II+AGN "composite" nuclei, which do not meet our spectral classification criteria for Seyferts. In an Appendix, we have investigated which emission line luminosities can provide the most reliable measures of the total non-stellar luminosity, estimated from our extensive multi-wavelength database. The hard X-ray or near-ultraviolet continuum luminosity can be crudely predicted from either the [O III]lambda 5007 angstrom luminosity or the combinations of [O III]+H beta or [N II]+H alpha lines, with a scatter of. 4 times for Sy 1s and +/- 10 times for Sy 2s. Although these uncertainties are large, the latter two hybrid (NLR+BLR) indicators have the advantage of predicting the same HX luminosity independent of Seyfert type.

Electron irradiation experiments of CH3OH-NH3-H2O and H2S-CH3OH-NH3-H2O ices were conducted to better understand the chemical differences between primordial planetesimals inside and outside the sublimation line of H2S. The main goal of this work is to test the chemical plausibility of the hypothesis correlating the color bimodality in Jupiter Trojans with sulfur chemistry in the incipient solar system. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of the irradiated mixtures allows the detection of small sulfur allotropes (S-3 and S-4) after the irradiation of H2S containing ice mixtures. These small, red polymers are metastable and could polymerize further under thermal processing and irradiation, producing larger sulfur polymers (mainly S-8) that are spectroscopically neutral at wavelengths above 500 nm. This transformation may affect the spectral reflectance of Jupiter Trojans in a different way compared to KBOs, thereby providing a useful framework for possibly differentiating and determining the formation and history of small bodies. Along with allotropes, we report the production of organosulfur molecules. Sulfur molecules produced in our experiment have been recently detected by Rosetta in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The very weak absorption of sulfur polymers in the infrared range hampers their identification on Trojans and KBOs, but these allotropes strongly absorb light at UV and Visible wavelengths. This suggests that high signal-to-noise ratio UV-Vis spectra of these objects could provide new constraints on their presence.

These measurements were taken as part of the Canadian Arctic ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) validation campaigns that have been carried out since 2004 during the polar sunrise period (from mid-February to mid-April). Each spring, two ground-based FTSs were used to measure total and partial columns of HF, O-3, and trace gases that impact O3 depletion, namely, HCl and HNO3. Additionally, some tropospheric greenhouse gases and pollutant species were measured, namely CH4, N2O, CO, and C2H6. During the same time period, the satellite-based ACE-FTS made measurements near Eureka and provided profiles of the same trace gases. Comparisons have been carried out between the measurements from the Portable Atmospheric Research Interferometric Spectrometer for the InfraRed (PARIS-IR) and the co-located high-resolution Bruker 125HR FTS, as well as with the latest version of the ACE-FTS retrievals (v3.5). The total column comparison between the two co-located ground-based FTSs, PARIS-IR and Bruker 125HR, found very good agreement for most of these species (except HF), with differences well below the estimated uncertainties (<= 6%) and with high correlations (R >= 0 : 8). Partial columns have been used for the ground-based to space-borne comparison, with coincident measurements selected based on time, distance, and scaled potential vorticity (sPV). The comparisons of the ground-based measurements with ACE-FTS show good agreement in the partial columns for most species within 6% (except for C2H6 and PARIS-IR HF), which is consistent with the total retrieval uncertainty of the ground-based instruments. The correlation coefficients (R) of the partial column comparisons for all eight species range from approximately 0.75 to 0.95. The comparisons show no notable increases of the mean differences over these 8 years, indicating the consistency of these datasets and suggesting that the space-borne ACE-FTS measurements have been stable over this period. In addition, changes in the amounts of these trace gases during springtime between 2006 and 2013 are presented and discussed. Increased O-3 (0.9% yr(-1)), HCl (1.7% yr(-1)), HF (3.8% yr(-1)), CH4 (0.5% yr(-1)), and C2H6 (2.3% yr(-1), 2009-2013) have been found with the PARIS-IR dataset, the longer of the two ground-based records.

Discrete and broadband electron acceleration in Jupiter's powerful aurora	NATURE			English	Article							MAGNETOSPHERE; OVAL	The most intense auroral emissions from Earth's polar regions, called discrete for their sharply defined spatial configurations, are generated by a process involving coherent acceleration of electrons by slowly evolving, powerful electric fields directed along the magnetic field lines that connect Earth's space environment to its polar regions(1,2). In contrast, Earth's less intense auroras are generally caused by wave scattering of magnetically trapped populations of hot electrons (in the case of diffuse aurora) or by the turbulent or stochastic downward acceleration of electrons along magnetic field lines by waves during transitory periods (in the case of broadband or Alfvenic aurora)(3,4). Jupiter's relatively steady main aurora has a power density that is so much larger than Earth's that it has been taken for granted that it must be generated primarily by the discrete auroral process(5-7). However, preliminary in situ measurements of Jupiter's auroral regions yielded no evidence of such a process(8-10). Here we report observations of distinct, high-energy, downward, discrete electron acceleration in Jupiter's auroral polar regions. We also infer upward magnetic-field-aligned electric potentials of up to 400 kiloelectronvolts, an order of magnitude larger than the largest potentials observed at Earth(11). Despite the magnitude of these upward electric potentials and the expectations from observations at Earth, the downward energy flux from discrete acceleration is less at Jupiter than that caused by broadband or stochastic processes, with broadband and stochastic characteristics that are substantially different from those at Earth.

The reaction of Criegee intermediate CH2OO with water dimer: primary products and atmospheric impact	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-PHASE OZONOLYSIS; PHOTOIONIZATION CROSS-SECTIONS; CONFORMER-DEPENDENT REACTIVITY; SULFURIC-ACID CONCENTRATIONS; VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; UV ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM; HYDROXYMETHYL HYDROPEROXIDE; CRI MECHANISM; FORMIC-ACID; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE	The rapid reaction of the smallest Criegee intermediate, CH2OO, with water dimers is the dominant removal mechanism for CH2OO in the Earth's atmosphere, but its products are not well understood. This reaction was recently suggested as a significant source of the most abundant tropospheric organic acid, formic acid (HCOOH), which is consistently underpredicted by atmospheric models. However, using time- resolved measurements of reaction kinetics by UV absorption and product analysis by photoionization mass spectrometry, we show that the primary products of this reaction are formaldehyde and hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide (HMHP), with direct HCOOH yields of less than 10%. Incorporating our results into a global chemistry-transport model further reduces HCOOH levels by 10-90%, relative to previous modeling assumptions, which indicates that the reaction CH2OO + water dimer by itself cannot resolve the discrepancy between the measured and predicted HCOOH levels.

Space-borne remote sensing provides basin-wide data on impacts of meteorological anomalies, an important complement to relatively limited ground observations across the Amazon's vast and remote humid tropical forests. Morning overpass QuikScat Ku-band microwave backscatter from the forest canopy was anomalously low during the 2005 drought, relative to the full instrument record of 1999-2009, and low morning backscatter persisted for 2006-2009, after which the instrument failed. The persistent low backscatter has been suggested to be indicative of increased forest vulnerability to future drought. To better ascribe the cause of the low post-drought backscatter, we analyzed multiyear, gridded remote sensing data sets of precipitation, land surface temperature, forest cover and forest cover loss, and microwave backscatter over the 2005 drought region in the southwestern Amazon Basin (4 degrees-12 degrees S,66 degrees-76 degrees W) and in adjacent 8 degrees x10 degrees regions to the north and east. We found moderate to weak correlations with the spatial distribution of persistent low backscatter for variables related to three groups of forest impacts: the 2005 drought itself, loss of forest cover, and warmer and drier dry seasons in the post-drought vs. the pre-drought years. However, these variables explained only about one quarter of the variability in depressed backscatter across the southwestern drought region. Our findings indicate that drought impact is a complex phenomenon and that better understanding can only come from more extensive ground data and/or analysis of frequent, spatially-comprehensive, high-resolution data or imagery before and after droughts.

We have developed and applied a novel inverse Abel transform algorithm on high rate RO total electron content measurements performed along GPS to CASSIOPE radio links to recover electron density profiles. The high-resolution density profiles inferred from the CASSIOPE RO are (1) in very good agreement with density profiles estimated from ionosonde data, measured over stations nearby to the latitude and longitude of the RO tangent points; (2) in good agreement with density profiles inferred from GPS RO measured by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC); and (3) in general agreement with density profiles estimated using the International Reference Ionosphere climatological model. Using both CASSIOPE and COSMIC RO observations, we identify, for the first time, that there exist differences in the characteristics of the electron number density profiles retrieved over landmasses and oceans. The density profiles over oceans exhibit widespread values and scale heights compared to density profiles over landmasses. We provide an explanation for the ocean-landmass discrepancy in terms of the unique wave coupling mechanisms operating over oceans and landmasses.

Lance			Operation load estimation of chain-like structures using fiber optic strain sensors	SMART STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fiber optic sensors; strain-field measurements; experimental models; smart buildings; load prediction; condition assessment	WIND LOADS; TALL BUILDINGS	The recent advancements in sensing technologies allow us to record measurements from target structures at multiple locations and with relatively high spatial resolution. Such measurements can be used to develop data-driven methodologies for condition assessment, control, and health monitoring of target structures. One of the state-of-the-art technologies, Fiber Optic Strain Sensors (FOSS), is developed at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, and is based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. These strain sensors are accurate, lightweight, and can provide almost continuous strain field measurements along the length of the fiber. The strain measurements can then be used for real-time shape-sensing and operational load-estimation of complex structural systems. While several works have demonstrated the successful implementation of FOSS on large-scale real-life aerospace structures (i.e., airplane wings), there is paucity of studies in the literature that have investigated the potential of extending the application of FOSS into civil structures (e.g., tall buildings, bridges, etc.). This work assesses the feasibility of using FOSS to predict operational loads (e.g., wind loads) on chain-like structures. A thorough investigation is performed using analytical, computational, and experimental models of a 4-story steel building test specimen, developed at the University of Southern California. This study provides guidelines on the implementation of the FOSS technology on building-like structures, addresses the associated technical challenges, and suggests potential modifications to a load-estimation algorithm, to achieve a robust methodology for predicting operational loads using strain-field measurements.

J	You, YL; Peters-Lidard, C; Turk, J; Ringerud, S; Yang, S				You, Yalei; Peters-Lidard, Christa; Turk, Joseph; Ringerud, Sarah; Yang, Song			Improving Overland Precipitation Retrieval with Brightness Temperature Temporal Variation	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							MICROWAVE SOUNDING UNIT; RAIN-RATE; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS; NEXT-GENERATION; PART I; LAND; ALGORITHM; SATELLITE; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	Current microwave precipitation retrieval algorithms utilize the instantaneous brightness temperature (TB) to estimate precipitation rate. This study presents a new idea that can be used to improve existing algorithms: using TB temporal variation DTB from the microwave radiometer constellation. As a proof of concept, microwave observations from eight polar-orbiting satellites are utilized to derive DTB. Results show that DTB correlates more strongly with precipitation rate than the instantaneous TB. Particularly, the correlation with precipitation rate improved to 20.6 by using DTB over the Rocky Mountains and north of 458N, while the correlation is only 20.1 by using TB. The underlying reason is that DTB largely eliminates the negative influence from snow-covered land, which frequently is misidentified as precipitation. Another reason is that DTB is less affected by environmental variation (e.g., temperature, water vapor). Further analysis shows that the magnitude of the correlation between DTB and precipitation rate is dependent on the satellite revisit frequency. Finally, it is shown that the retrieval results from DTB are superior to that from TB, with the largest improvement in winter. Additionally, the retrieved precipitation rate over snow-covered regions by only using DTB at 89 GHz agrees well with the ground radar observations, which opens new opportunities to retrieve precipitation in high latitudes for sensors with the highest frequency at; 89 GHz. This study implies that a geostationary microwave radiometer can significantly improve precipitation retrieval performance. It also highlights the importance of maintaining the current passive microwave satellite constellation.

The stratigraphy and history of Mars' northern lowlands through mineralogy of impact craters: A comprehensive survey	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							VASTITAS BOREALIS FORMATION; HYDRATED SILICATES; ACIDALIA PLANITIAE; HYDROUS MINERALS; CENTRAL UPLIFTS; ANCIENT; SURFACE; PLAINS; REFLECTANCE; DIVERSITY	The basin-filling materials of the northern lowlands, which cover approximately one third of Mars' surface, record the long-term evolution of Mars' geology and climate. The buried stratigraphy was inferred through analyses of impact crater mineralogy, detected using data acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars. Examining 1045 impact craters across the northern lowlands, we find widespread olivine and pyroxene and diverse hydrated/hydroxylated minerals, including Fe/Mg smectite, chlorite, prehnite, and hydrated silica. The distribution of mafic minerals is consistent with infilling volcanic materials across the entire lowlands (similar to 1-4 x 10(7) km(3)), indicating a significant volume of volatile release by volcanic outgassing. Hydrated/hydroxylated minerals are detected more frequently in large craters, consistent with the scenario that the hydrated minerals are being excavated from deep basement rocks, beneath 1-2 km thick mafic lava flows or volcaniclastic materials. The prevalences of different types of hydrated minerals are similar to statistics from the southern highlands. No evidence of concentrated salt deposits has been found, which would indicate a long-lived global ocean. We also find significant geographical variations of local mineralogy and stratigraphy in different basins (geological provinces), independent of dust cover. For example, many hydrated and mafic minerals are newly discovered within the polar Scandia region (> 60 degrees N), and Chryse Planitia has more mafic mineral detections than other basins, possibly due to a previously unrecognized volcanic source.

Theoretical analysis of nBn infrared photodetectors	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						infrared detector; unipolar barrier; nBn	NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DETECTORS; DEVICES	The depletion and surface leakage dark current suppression properties of unipolar barrier device architectures such as the nBn have been highly beneficial for III-V semiconductor-based infrared detectors. Using a one-dimensional drift-diffusion model, we theoretically examine the effects of contact doping, minority carrier lifetime, and absorber doping on the dark current characteristics of nBn detectors to explore some basic aspects of their operation. We found that in a properly designed nBn detector with highly doped excluding contacts the minority carriers are extracted to nonequilibrium levels under reverse bias in the same manner as the high operating temperature (HOT) detector structure. Longer absorber Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetimes result in lower diffusion and depletion dark currents. Higher absorber doping can also lead to lower diffusion and depletion dark currents, but the benefit should be weighted against the possibility of reduced diffusion length due to shortened SRH lifetime. We also briefly examined nBn structures with unintended minority carrier blocking barriers due to excessive n-doping in the unipolar electron barrier, or due to a positive valence band offset between the barrier and the absorber. Both types of hole blocking structures lead to higher turn-on bias, although barrier n-doping could help suppress depletion dark current.

Origin of warm and hot gas emission from low-mass protostars: Herschel-HIFI observations of CO J=16-15 I. Line profiles, physical conditions, and H2O abundance	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; ISM: jets and outflows; line: profiles; stars: formation; stars: jets; stars: winds; outflows	YOUNG STELLAR OBJECTS; BIPOLAR OUTFLOWS; WATER; EXCITATION; MOLECULES; H-2; SPECTRA; PROGRAM; WINDS; DISKS	Context. Through spectrally unresolved observations of high-J CO transitions, Herschel Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) has revealed large reservoirs of warm (300 K) and hot (700 K) molecular gas around low-mass protostars. The excitation and physical origin of this gas is still not understood. Aims. We aim to shed light on the excitation and origin of the CO ladder observed toward protostars, and on the water abundance in different physical components within protostellar systems using spectrally resolved Herschel-HIFI data. Methods. Observations are presented of the highly excited CO line J = 16-15 (E-up /k(B) = 750 K) with the Herschel Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) toward a sample of 24 low-mass protostellar objects. The sources were selected from the Herschel "Water in Star-forming regions with Herschel" (WISH) and "Dust, Ice, and Gas in Time" (DIGIT) key programs. Results. The spectrally resolved line profiles typically show two distinct velocity components: a broad Gaussian component with an average FWHM of 20 km s(-1) containing the bulk of the flux, and a narrower Gaussian component with a FWHM of 5 km s(-1) that is often off set from the source velocity. Some sources show other velocity components such as extremely-high-velocity features or "bullets". All these velocity components were first detected in H2O line profiles. The average rotational temperature over the entire profile, as measured from comparison between CO J = 16-15 and 10-9 emission, is similar to 300 K. A radiative-transfer analysis shows that the average H2O/CO column-density ratio is similar to 0.02, suggesting a total H2O abundance of similar to 2 x 10(-6), independent of velocity. Conclusions. Two distinct velocity profiles observed in the HIFI line profiles suggest that the high-J CO ladder observed with PACS consists of two excitation components. The warm PACS component (300 K) is associated with the broad HIFI component, and the hot PACS component (700 K) is associated with the off set HIFI component. The former originates in either outflow cavity shocks or the disk wind, and the latter in irradiated shocks. The low water abundance can be explained by photodissociation. The ubiquity of the warm and hot CO components suggest that fundamental mechanisms govern the excitation of these components; we hypothesize that the warm component arises when H-2 stops being the dominant coolant. In this scenario, the hot component arises in cooling molecular H-2-poor gas just prior to the onset of H-2 formation. High spectral resolution observations of highly excited CO transitions uniquely shed light on the origin of warm and hot gas in low-mass protostellar objects.	[Kristensen, L.

The pre-main-sequence evolution of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs is studied numerically starting from the formation of a protostellar or proto-brown dwarf seed and taking into account the mass accretion onto the central object during the initial several Myr of evolution. Methods. The stellar evolution was computed using the STELLAR evolution code with recent modifications. The mass accretion rates were taken from numerical hydrodynamics models by computing the circumstellar disk evolution starting from the gravitational collapse of prestellar cloud cores of various mass and angular momentum. The resulting stellar evolution tracks were compared with the isochrones and isomasses calculated using non-accreting models. Results. We find that mass accretion in the initial several Myr of protostellar evolution can have a strong effect on the subsequent evolution of young stars and brown dwarfs. The disagreement between accreting and non-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L-*, stellar radius R-*,R- and effective temperature T-eff depends on the thermal efficiency of accretion, that is, on the fraction of accretion energy that is absorbed by the central object. The largest mismatch is found for the cold accretion case, in which essentially all accretion energy is radiated away. The relative deviations in L-* and R-* in this case can reach 50% for objects 1.0 Myr old, and they remain notable even for objects 10 Myr old. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in which a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement between accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still remains notable for objects 1.0 Myr old. These disagreements may lead to an incorrect age estimate for objects of (sub-)solar mass when using the isochrones that are based on non-accreting models, as has also been noted previously. We find that objects with strong luminosity bursts exhibit notable excursions in the L-* - T-eff diagram, but the character of these excursions is distinct for hybrid or hot and cold accretion scenarios. In particular, the cold accretion scenario predicts peak luminosities that are greater than those of known FU Orionis-type outbursts, which implies that cold accretion is physically less realistic. Conclusions. Mass accretion during the early stages of star and brown dwarf evolution is an important factor, but its effect depends on the details of how the accreted energy can further be distributed within the star. Efforts should now be made to better understand the character of accretion in young protostellar objects.

All variables are averaged over wet areas and dry areas to investigate temporal variations of different variables over these regions. We found that all models demonstrate similar temporal variations of precipitation as the observational data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, with positive trend over wet areas (6.223.75mm/mon/decade) and negative trend over dry areas (-0.770.54mm/mon/decade). Positive trends of vertical velocity, total cloud fraction, condensed water path, and ice water path are also found in the observations and models over the wet areas. Observations also demonstrate decreasing trends of vertical velocity, total clouds, condensed water path, and ice water path over the dry areas, which can be simulated by most models with a few exceptions. The qualitatively consistent trends in these variables (i.e., vertical velocity, cloud, liquid, and ice water contents) as revealed from the observations and CMIPS models provide a clearer picture of the dynamics and physics behind the temporal variations of precipitation over different areas.

Resolving the Model-Observation Discrepancy in the Mesospheric and Stratospheric HOx Chemistry	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							MICROWAVE LIMB SOUNDER; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; PHOTOCHEMICAL MODEL; COLUMN ABUNDANCE; ROTATION CYCLE; AURA MLS; OH; HYDROXYL; SPECTROMETER	We examine the middle atmospheric odd-hydrogen (HOx) chemistry by comparing the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) OH and HO2 measurements with a photochemical model simulation. The model underestimates mesospheric OH and HO2 concentrations if the standard chemical kinetic rates are used, whether the model H2O and O-3 are constrained with observations or not. To resolve the discrepancies, we adjust the kinetic rate coefficients of three key reactions (O+OHO2+H, OH+HO2H2O+O-2, and H+O-2+MHO2+M) and the O-2 photo absorption cross section at Lyman (121.57nm) using the Bayesian optimal estimation. A much better model-observation agreement can be achieved if the kinetic rate coefficients for H+O-2+MHO2+M is increased by 134-310%, and the O-2 photo absorption cross section at Lyman is reduced by 33-54%, while the kinetic rate coefficients for O+OHO2+H and OH+HO2H2O+O-2 remain consistent with the current laboratory values. The kinetic rate coefficient for H+O-2+MHO2+M requires a very large adjustment beyond the uncertainty limits recommended in the NASA Data Evaluation, suggesting the need for future laboratory measurements. An alternative explanation is that the radiative association reaction, H+O2HO2+h, plays a significant role, which has never been measured. Our results demonstrate that high-quality satellite observations can be used to constrain photochemical parameters and help improve our understanding of atmospheric chemistry.

First identification of lunar tides in satellite observations of noctilucent clouds	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Workshop on Layered Phenomena in the Mesopause Region (LPMR)	AUG 10-13, 2015	Univ Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO		Univ Colorado Boulder	Noctilucent clouds; Polar mesospheric clouds; Lunar tides	POLAR MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS	Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) are optically thin ice clouds occurring near the polar summer mesopause. NLCs are a highly variable phenomenon subject to different sources of variability. Here we report on a poorly understood mechanism affecting NLCs, i.e., the lunar gravitational tide. We extract remarkably clear and statistically highly significant lunar semidiurnal tidal signatures in NLC occurrence frequency, NLC albedo and NLC ice water content from observations with the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) satellite instruments using the superposed epoch analysis method applied to a data set covering more than 3 decades. The lunar semidiurnal tide is identified in NLC measurements in both hemispheres. In addition, lunar semidiurnal tidal signatures in polar summer mesopause temperature were extracted from space borne observations with the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and the phases of the lunar tidal signatures in NLC parameters and temperature are demonstrated to be consistent. To our best knowledge these results constitute the first identification of the lunar tide in non-visual NLC observations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In 2004-2005, SPNA decadal upper ocean and sea-surface temperature trends reversed from warming during 1994-2004 to cooling over 2005-2015. This recent decadal trend reversal in SPNA ocean heat content (OHC) is studied using a physically consistent, observationally constrained global ocean state estimate covering 1992-2015. The estimate's physical consistency facilitates quantitative causal attribution of ocean variations. Closed heat budget diagnostics reveal that the SPNA OHC trend reversal is the result of heat advection by midlatitude ocean circulation. Kinematic decompositions reveal that changes in the deep and intermediate vertical overturning circulation cannot account for the trend reversal, but rather ocean heat transports by horizontal gyre circulations render the primary contributions. The shift in horizontal gyre advection reflects anomalous circulation acting on the mean temperature gradients. Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) reveals strong covariation between the anomalous horizontal gyre circulation and variations in the local wind stress curl, suggestive of a Sverdrup response. Results have implications for decadal predictability.

J	Nash, D; Ye, HC; Fetzer, E				Nash, Deanna; Ye, Hengchun; Fetzer, Eric			Spatial and Temporal Variability in Winter Precipitation across the Western United States during the Satellite Era	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						precipitation; intensity; TRMM; AIRS; western United States	ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; EL-NINO; FLOODS; CALIFORNIA; FREQUENCY; INTENSITY; PACIFIC	The western United States is known for its water shortages due to large seasonal and inter-annual variability of precipitation as well as increasing demand. Climate change will impact the availability of water in the western United States through the modification of precipitation characteristics. Satellite data presents the opportunity to study these changes at a fine, continuous spatial resolutionparticularly in places where no traditional ground observations exist. Utilizing the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 version 7 precipitation data, this study examines the spatio-temporal changes in precipitation characteristics over the western United States between 1998 and 2015, and their connections with the atmospheric total column water vapor and the El Nino Southern Oscillation during the winter season. The results show that precipitation frequency in the western United States has been decreasing in general, precipitation totals and mean daily intensity are increasing in northwestern United States, but decreasing in the southwest United States during the 18 years of the study time period. Additionally, results show a strong relationship between total column water vapor and the precipitation characteristics, specifically in the southwestern United States.

Ionosphere-thermosphere energy budgets for the ICME storms of March 2013 and 2015 estimated with GITM and observational proxies	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						ionosphere; thermosphere; energy budget; space weather; forecasting; modeling	5.3 MU-M; SOLAR-WIND; LATITUDE THERMOSPHERE; FIELD VARIABILITY; LOWER ATMOSPHERE; MAGNETIC STORM; POYNTING FLUX; MODEL; ELECTRODYNAMICS; EVENTS	The ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) energy partitioning for the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) storms of 16-19 March 2013 and 2015 is estimated with the Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM), empirical models and proxies derived from in situ measurements. We focus on auroral heating, Joule heating, and thermospheric cooling. Solar wind data, F-10.7, OVATION Prime model and the Weimer 2005 model are used to drive GITM from above. Thermospheric nitric oxide and carbon dioxide cooling emission powers and fluxes are estimated from TIMED/SABER measurements. Assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) estimations of hemispheric power and Joule heating are presented, based on data from global magnetometers, the AMPERE magnetic field data, SSUSI auroral images, and the SuperDARN radar network. Modeled Joule heating and auroral heating of the IT system are mostly controlled by external driving in the March 2013 and 2015 storms, while NO cooling persists into the storm recovery phase. The total heating in the model is about 1000 GW to 3000 GW. Additionally, we intercompare contributions in selected energy channels for five coronal mass ejection-type storms modeled with GITM. Modeled auroral heating shows reasonable agreement with AMIE hemispheric power and is higher than other observational proxies. Joule heating and infrared cooling are likely underestimated in GITM. We discuss challenges and discrepancies in estimating and global modeling of the IT energy partitioning, especially Joule heating, during geomagnetic storms. Plain Language Summary Energy budget is an important characteristic of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. We utilize Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model runs for two strong recent geomagnetic storms, March 2013 and March 2015. In the paper we intercompare and evaluate different available sources for estimation of energy terms, including global modeling, empirical models, and direct satellite measurements. We discuss challenges and discrepancies in estimating and global modeling of the ionosphere-thermosphere energy partitioning, especially Joule heating, during geomagnetic storms. Understanding energy budget and improving its estimates are important for the space weather forecasting efforts.	[Verkhoglyadova, O. P.; Meng, X.; Mannucci, A.

The need from the community for a better model incubated the development of AP9/AE9/SPM, which addresses several shortcomings of the old model. We provide additional validation of AP9/AE9 by comparing in situ electron and proton data from Jason-2, Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES), and the Van Allen Probes spacecraft with the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles from AE9/AP9 and with the model outputs from AE8/AP8. The relatively short duration of Van Allen Probes and Jason-2 missions means that their measurements are most certainly the result of specific climatological conditions. In low Earth orbit (LEO), the Jason-2 proton flux is better reproduced by AP8 compared to AP9, while the POES electron data are well enveloped by AE9 5th and 95th percentiles. The shape of the South Atlantic anomaly (SAA) from Jason-2 data is better captured by AP9 compared to AP8, while the peak SAA flux is better reproduced by AP8. The <1.5MeV inner belt electrons from Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS) are well enveloped by AE9 5th and 95th percentiles, while AE8 overpredicts the measurements. In the outer radiation belt, MagEIS and Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT) electrons closely follow the median estimate from AE9, while AP9 5th and 95th percentiles generally envelope REPT proton measurements in the inner belt and slot regions. While AE9/AP9 offer the flexibility to specify the environment with different confidence levels, the dose and trapped proton peak flux for POES and Jason-2 trajectories from the AE9/AP9 50th percentile and above are larger than the estimates from the AE8/AP8 models.

For Io, it is desirable to determine the temperature of the erupting lavas as this measurement constrains lava composition. One method of determining lava eruption temperature is by measuring radiant flux at two or more wavelengths and fitting a blackbody thermal emission function. Only certain styles of volcanic activity are suitable, those where detectable thermal emission is from a restricted range of surface temperatures close to the eruption temperature. Volcanic processes where this occurs include large lava fountains; smaller lava fountains common in active lava lakes; and lava tube skylights. Problems that must be overcome to obtain usable data are: (1) the rapid cooling of the lava between data acquisitions at different wavelengths, (2) the unknown magnitude of thermal emission, which has often led to detector saturation, and (3) thermal emission changing on a shorter timescale than the observation integration time. We can overcome these problems by using the HOT BIRD detector and a novel, advanced digital readout circuit (D-ROIC) to achieve a wide dynamic range sufficient to image lava on Io without saturating. We have created an instrument model that allows various instrument parameters (including mirror diameter, number of signal splits, exposure duration, filter band pass, and optics transmissivity) to be tested to determine the detectability of thermal sources on Io's surface. We find that a short-wavelength infrared instrument on an Io flyby mission can achieve simultaneity of observations by splitting the incoming signal for all relevant eruption processes and still obtain data fast enough to remove uncertainties in accurate determination of the highest lava surface temperatures. Observations at 1 and 1.5 mu m are sufficient for this purpose. Even with a ten-way beam split, instrument throughput generates acceptable signal-to-noise values. Accurate constraints on lava eruption temperature are also possible with a visible wavelength detector so long as data at different wavelengths are obtained simultaneously and integration time is very short. Fast integration times are important for examining the thermal emission from lava tube skylights due to rapidly changing viewing geometry during close flybys. The technology described here is applicable to instruments observing terrestrial volcanism and for investigating proposed volcanic activity on Venus, where lava composition is not known.

Digitally fabricated multi-modal wireless sensing using a combination of printed sensors and transistors with silicon components	FLEXIBLE AND PRINTED ELECTRONICS			English	Article						printed electronics; flexible electronics; organic semiconductors; photovoltaic; printed sensors; wireless system; systems integration	FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; THIN-FILM TRANSISTORS; ORGANIC TRANSISTORS; NONVOLATILE MEMORY; ELECTRONICS; CIRCUITS; POLYMER; SKIN	Printing is a promising manufacturing approach for the fabrication of flexible, large-area, custom sensor systems for applications such as wearable electronics and sensor labels. While printed examples of many physical and chemical sensors have been demonstrated, functionality useful for stand-alone systems such as high-resolution analog-to-digital conversion and wireless communication to address these sensors is not currently available in circuits printed entirely from solution. In order to retain the benefits of print manufacturing without sacrificing performance, a hybrid approach can be followed where printed and pre-fabricated devices are used together. In this report a mostly-printed wireless light and temperature sensor system that operates at 3.6 V and reports light and temperature readings wirelessly with a sensitivity of 0.7 degrees C and 2.5 mu W cm(-2) at 500 nm respectively is demonstrated. The number of printed components was maximized and off-the-shelf microfabricated devices were only introduced where functionality is not currently achievable through printing. Onto a flexible polyester substrate, print processes were used to fabricate the bulk-heterojunction photodiode, thermistor, low-voltage operation multiplexing transistors, antenna, passives and interconnects, and silicon ICs are used for signal processing, memory and wireless communication. The printed components (sensors and transistors) were specifically developed to facilitate electrical integration into the hybrid system.	[Whiting, G. L.; Schwartz, D. E.; Ng, T. N.; Krusor, B.

Temporal Evolution of the High-energy Irradiation and Water Content of TRAPPIST-1 Exoplanets	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; stars: individual (TRAPPIST-1); stars: low-mass; ultraviolet: planetary systems	TERRESTRIAL PLANETS; ATMOSPHERIC LOSS; NEUTRAL ATOMS; DWARF; MASS; EVAPORATION; MANTLE; STARS; PERIDOTITE; HYDROGEN	The ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 hosts seven Earth-size transiting planets, some of which could harbor liquid water on their surfaces. Ultraviolet observations are essential to measuring their high-energy irradiation and searching for photodissociated water escaping from their putative atmospheres. Our new observations of the TRAPPIST-1 Ly alpha line during the transit of TRAPPIST-1c show an evolution of the star emission over three months, preventing us from assessing the presence of an extended hydrogen exosphere. Based on the current knowledge of the stellar irradiation, we investigated the likely history of water loss in the system. Planets b to d might still be in a runaway phase, and planets within the orbit of TRAPPIST-1g could have lost more than 20 Earth oceans after 8 Gyr of hydrodynamic escape. However, TRAPPIST-le to h might have lost less than three Earth oceans if hydrodynamic escape stopped once they entered the habitable zone (HZ). We caution that these estimates remain limited by the large uncertainty on the planet masses. They likely represent upper limits on the actual water loss because our assumptions maximize the X-rays to ultraviolet-driven escape, while photodissociation in the upper atmospheres should be the limiting process. Late-stage outgassing could also have contributed significant amounts of water for the outer, more massive planets after they entered the HZ. While our results suggest that the outer planets are the best candidates to search for water with the JWST, they also highlight the need for theoretical studies and complementary observations in all wavelength domains to determine the nature of the TRAPPIST-1 planets and their potential habitability.

The strength of the meridional overturning circulation of the stratosphere	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							BREWER-DOBSON CIRCULATION; WATER-VAPOR; MEAN AGE; GLOBAL-MODELS; ERA-INTERIM; AIR; MIPAS; SF6; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY	The distribution of gases such as ozone and water vapour in the stratosphere-which affect surface climate-is influenced by the meridional overturning of mass in the stratosphere, the Brewer-Dobson circulation. However, observation-based estimates of the global strength of this circulation are difficult to obtain. Here we present two calculations of the mean strength of the meridional overturning of the stratosphere. We analyse satellite data that document the global diabatic circulation between 2007-2011, and compare these to three reanalysis data sets and to simulations with a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model. Using measurements of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrous oxide, we calculate the global mean diabatic overturning mass flux throughout the stratosphere. In the lower stratosphere, these two estimates agree, and at a potential temperature level of 460 K (about 20 km or 60 hPa in tropics) the global circulation strength is 6.3-7.6 x 10(9) kg s(-1). Higher in the atmosphere, only the SF6-based estimate is available, and it diverges from the reanalysis data and simulations. Interpretation of the SF6-data-based estimate is limited because of a mesospheric sink of SF6; however, the reanalyses also differ substantially from each other. We conclude that the uncertainty in the mean meridional overturning circulation strength at upper levels of the stratosphere amounts to at least 100%.

In this low-column-density regime, we derive a characteristic value of N-H I/E(B - V) = 8.8 x 10(21) cm(2) mag(-1) for gas with vertical bar v(LSR)vertical bar < 90 km s(-1) and find no significant reddening associated with gas at higher velocities. We compare our H I-based reddening map with the Schlegel et al. (SFD) reddening map and find them consistent to within a scatter of similar or equal to 5 mmag. Further, the differences between our map and the SFD map are in excellent agreement with the low-resolution (4.degrees 5) corrections to the SFD map derived by Peek and Graves based on observed reddening toward passive galaxies. We therefore argue that our H I-based map provides the most accurate interstellar reddening estimates in the low-column-density regime to date.

J	Amaya, DJ; DeFlorio, MJ; Miller, AJ; Xie, SP				Amaya, Dillon J.; DeFlorio, Michael J.; Miller, Arthur J.; Xie, Shang-Ping			WES feedback and the Atlantic Meridional Mode: observations and CMIP5 comparisons	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Atlantic Meridional Mode; WES feedback; CMIP5; Air-sea interactions; Maximum covariance analysis	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODEL; SEASONAL FOOTPRINTING MECHANISM; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; DECADAL VARIABILITY; COUPLED MODEL; NORTH PACIFIC; HEAT-FLUX; RAINFALL	The Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) is the dominant mode of tropical SST/wind coupled variability. Modeling studies have implicated wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback as the primary driver of the AMM's evolution across the Atlantic basin; however, a robust coupling of the SST and winds has not been shown in observations. This study examines observed AMM growth, propagation, and decay as a result of WES interactions. Investigation of an extended maximum covariance analysis shows that boreal wintertime atmospheric forcing generates positive SST anomalies (SSTA) through a reduction of surface evaporative cooling. When the AMM peaks in magnitude during spring and summer, upward latent heat flux anomalies occur over the warmest SSTs and act to dampen the initial forcing. In contrast, on the southwestern edge of the SSTA, SST-forced cross-equatorial flow reduces the strength of the climatological trade winds and provides an anomalous latent heat flux into the ocean, which causes southwestward propagation of the initial atmosphere-forced SSTA through WES dynamics. Additionally, the lead-lag relationship of the ocean and atmosphere indicates a transition from an atmosphere-forcing-ocean regime in the northern subtropics to a highly coupled regime in the northern tropics that is not observed in the southern hemisphere. CMIP5 models poorly simulate the latitudinal transition from a one-way interaction to a two-way feedback, which may explain why they also struggle to reproduce spatially coherent interactions between tropical Atlantic SST and winds. This analysis provides valuable insight on how meridional modes act as links between extratropical and tropical variability and focuses future research aimed at improving climate model simulations.

We found that convective days (showers and those associated with thunder and lightning) have become more frequent possibly at the expense of non-convective ones for all seasons during the study period of 1966-2000. The mean trends for convective day fraction (total convective precipitation events divided by all precipitation events for each season) are very similar among all four seasons at around 0.61-0.76% per year averaged over the study region. The temperature and humidity associated with convective events are on average 2.4-5.6 A degrees C and 0.4-0.9 g/kg higher than those of non-convective events, respectively. This study suggests that surface warming and moistening lead to increased tropospheric static instability, contributing to the observed trends.

Here, we analyze whether soil moisture can be estimated from three DInSAR observables without making any assumptions about its complex spatio-temporal dynamics, with the goal of removing its contribution from the displacement estimates. We find that the referenced DInSAR phase can be a suitable means to estimate mv time series up to an overall offset, as indicated by correlations with in situ measurements of 0.75-0.90 in two campaigns. However, the phase can only be referenced when no displacements (and atmospheric delays) occur or when they can be estimated reliably. We study the separability of displacements and mv using two additional DInSAR observables (closure phase and coherence magnitude) that are sensitive to mv but insensitive to displacements. However, our analyses show that neither contains enough information for this purpose, i.e., it is not possible to estimate mv uniquely. The soil moisture correction of the displacement estimates is hence ambiguous too. Their applicability is furthermore limited by their proneness to model misspecifications and decorrelation. Consequently, the separation of soil moisture changes and displacements using DInSAR observations alone is difficult in practice, and-like for mitigating tropospheric errors-additional data (e.g., external mv estimates) or assumptions (e.g., spatio-temporal patterns) are required when the mv effects on the displacement estimates are comparable to the magnitude of the movements. This will be critical when soil moisture changes are correlated with the actual displacements.

Since April 2015, the radiometer has been under calibration and validation to assess the quality of the radiometer L1B data product. Calibration methods, including the SMAP L1B TA2TB [from antenna temperature (TA) to the Earth's surface brightness temperature (TB)] algorithm and TA forward models, are outlined, and validation approaches for calibration stability/quality are described in this paper, including future work. Results show that the current radiometer L1B data product (version 3) satisfies its requirements (uncertainty <1.3 K and calibration drift < 0.4 K/months, and geolocation uncertainty < 4 km) although there are biases in TA over cold sky and in TB comparing with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity TB v620 data products.

This ensemble starts with a formal systems architecting framework to describe a Mars Colony and capture its artifacts' parameters and technical attributes. The resulting database is then linked to a variety of "downstream" analytic models. In particular, we integrated an extraction process (i.e., "mining") model, a simulation of the colony's environmental control and life support infrastructure known as HabNet, and a risk-based economics model. The mining model focuses on the technologies associated with in situ resource extraction, processing, storage and handling, and delivery. This model computes the production rate as a function of the systems' technical parameters and the local Mars environment. HabNet simulates the fundamental sustainability relationships associated with establishing and maintaining the colony's population. The economics model brings together market information, investment and operating costs, along with measures of market uncertainty and Monte Carlo techniques, with the objective of determining the profitability of commercial water/ice in situ mining operations. All told, over 50 market and technical parameters can be varied in order to address "what-if" questions, including colony location.

However, orbiting multiple moons of the same planet would be extremely prohibitive using traditional propulsion and power technologies. In this paper, a new mission concept, named Magnetour, is presented to facilitate the exploration of outer planet systems and address both power and propulsion challenges. This approach would enable a single spacecraft to orbit and travel between multiple moons of an outer planet, without significant propellant or on-board power source. To achieve this free-lunch 'Grand Tour', Magnetour exploits the unexplored combination of magnetic and multi-body gravitational fields of planetary systems, with a unique focus on using a bare electrodynamic tether for power and propulsion. Preliminary results indicate that the Magnetour concept is sound and is potentially highly promising at Jupiter.

The NuSTAR Serendipitous Survey: Hunting for the Most Extreme Obscured AGN at > 10keV	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: general surveys; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; COMPTON-THICK QUASARS; DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; X-RAY CORRELATION; RESOLUTION SPECTRAL TEMPLATES; APPROXIMATE-TO 2; XMM-NEWTON; GALAXY MERGERS; MU-M	We identify sources with extremely hard X-ray spectra (i.e., with photon indices of Gamma less than or similar to 0.6) in the 13 deg(2) NuSTAR serendipitous survey, to search for the most highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected at > 10 keV. Eight extreme NuSTAR sources are identified, and we use the NuSTAR data in combination with lower-energy X-ray observations (from Chandra, Swift. XRT, and XMM-Newton) to characterize the broadband (0.5-24 keV) X-ray spectra. We find that all of the extreme sources are highly obscured AGNs, including three robust Compton-thick (CT; N-H > 1.5 X 10(24) cm(-2)) AGNs at low redshift (z < 0.1) and a likely CT AGN at higher redshift (z = 0.16). Most of the extreme sources would not have been identified as highly obscured based on the low-energy (< 10 keV) X-ray coverage alone. The multiwavelength properties (e.g., optical spectra and X-ray-mid-IR luminosity ratios) provide further support for the eight sources being significantly obscured. Correcting for absorption, the intrinsic rest-frame 10-40. keV luminosities of the extreme sources cover a broad range, from approximate to 5 X 10(42) to 10(45) erg s(-1). The estimated number counts of CT AGNs in the NuSTAR serendipitous survey are in broad agreement with model expectations based on previous X-ray surveys, except for the lowest redshifts (z < 0.07), where we measure a high CT fraction of F-CT(obs) = 30(-12)(+16) %. For the small sample of CT AGNs, we find a high fraction of galaxy major mergers (50% +/- 33%) compared to control samples of "normal" AGNs.	[Lansbury, G. B.; Aird, J.; Walton, D.

Autonomous Navigation Using X-Ray Pulsars and Multirate Processing	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							NOISE	In this paper, autonomous pulsar-based spacecraft navigation is formulated in terms of a single nonlinear filter. The observability and the positioning accuracy of a spacecraft traveling at known constant velocity are analyzed to build insights into the general navigation problem. A variation of the extended Kalman filter is developed and implemented to track Poisson pulsar measurements collected by an orbiting spacecraft. This filter leverages multirate structure to more efficiently process pulsar measurements. An alternative formulation using quadrature is studied, and its performance is compared to the typical phase approach. Simulation results for an orbiter mission and a deepspace mission are presented to show the accuracy of pulsar-based navigation in space.

This class of trajectories is advantageous for potential Mars atmospheric sample return missions because of its low geocentric energy at departure and arrival, because it would enable two sample collections at unique locations during different Martian seasons, and because of its lack of deterministic maneuvers. Free return opportunities are documented over Earth departure dates ranging from 2015 through 2100, with viable missions available every Earth-Mars synodic period. After constraining the maximum lift-to-drag ratio to be less than one, the minimum observed Earth departure hyperbolic excess speed is 3.23 km/s, the minimum Earth atmospheric entry speed is 11.42 km/s, and the minimum round-trip flight time is 805 days. An algorithm using simplified dynamics is developed along with a method to derive an initial estimate for trajectories in a more realistic dynamic model. Multiple examples are presented, including free returns that pass outside and inside of Mars's appreciable atmosphere.

Co-Design of Strain-Actuated Solar Arrays for Spacecraft Precision Pointing and Jitter Reduction	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	57th AIAA/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference	JAN 04-08, 2016	San Diego, CA	AIAA, ASCE, AHS, ASC			VIBRATION CONTROL; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; ACTIVE CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION	This work presents a novel spacecraft attitude control architecture using strain-actuated solar arrays that does not require the use of conventional attitude control hardware. A strain-actuated solar array enables attitude slewing maneuvers and precision pointing (image acquisition) stares, while simultaneously suppressing structural vibrations. Distributed piezoelectric actuators help achieve higher precision, higher bandwidth, and quieter operation than reaction wheels. To understand the design tradeoffs for this architecture, a framework for the integrated design of distributed structural geometry and distributed control is presented. The physical properties of the array are modeled and designed with respect to a piecewise linear distributed thickness profile. The distributed control is a voltage profile across the array modeled as a spatially continuous function. The dynamics of the system are modeled using a coupled ordinary differential equation-partial differential equation system using extended generalizations for hybrid coordinate systems. The combined physical and control system design, or co-design problem is investigated to understand the optimal performance of the system. Single-axis slew maneuvers of 7.2 milliradians or 1485 arcsec are achieved for a representative spacecraft model without increasing array mass or reducing array planform area. From additional tradeoff studies, a design criteria is revealed for the array structure and control strategy based on the optimal design tradeoff between large array inertia and fast structural dynamics. Moreover, the fundamental limits on strain-actuated solar arrays slew angle magnitude are demonstrated using an intuitive pseudorigid body dynamic model.

Crucial steps that could be simulated in the laboratory include simulations of water-rock chemistry (e.g., serpentinization) to produce hydrothermal fluids, the types of mineral catalysts and energy gradients produced in vent interfaces where hydrothermal fluids interface with the surrounding seawater, and simulations of biologically relevant chemistry in flow-through gradient systems (i.e., far-from-equilibrium experiments). We describe some examples of experimental designs in detail, which are adaptable and could be used to test particular hypotheses about ocean world energetics or mineral/organic chemistry. Enceladus among the ocean worlds provides an ideal test case, since the pressure at the ocean floor is more easily simulated in the lab. Results for Enceladus could be extrapolated with further experiments and modeling to understand other ocean worlds.

Digital Holographic Microscopy, a Method for Detection of Microorganisms in Plume Samples from Enceladus and Other Icy Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						In situ life detection; Extant microorganisms; Holographic microscopy; Ocean Worlds; Enceladus; Imaging	REFRACTIVE-INDEX; CELL MORPHOMETRY; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; GRAM STAIN; BACTERIA; FLUORESCENCE; ENUMERATION; SURVIVABILITY; BIOSIGNATURE; POPULATIONS	Detection of extant microbial life on Earth and elsewhere in the Solar System requires the ability to identify and enumerate micrometer-scale, essentially featureless cells. On Earth, bacteria are usually enumerated by culture plating or epifluorescence microscopy. Culture plates require long incubation times and can only count culturable strains, and epifluorescence microscopy requires extensive staining and concentration of the sample and instrumentation that is not readily miniaturized for space. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) represents an alternative technique with no moving parts and higher throughput than traditional microscopy, making it potentially useful in space for detection of extant microorganisms provided that sufficient numbers of cells can be collected. Because sample collection is expected to be the limiting factor for space missions, especially to outer planets, it is important to quantify the limits of detection of any proposed technique for extant life detection. Here we use both laboratory and field samples to measure the limits of detection of an off-axis digital holographic microscope (DHM). A statistical model is used to estimate any instrument's probability of detection at various bacterial concentrations based on the optical performance characteristics of the instrument, as well as estimate the confidence interval of detection. This statistical model agrees well with the limit of detection of 10(3) cells/mL that was found experimentally with laboratory samples. In environmental samples, active cells were immediately evident at concentrations of 10(4) cells/mL. Published estimates of cell densities for Enceladus plumes yield up to 10 4 cells/mL, which are well within the off-axis DHM's limits of detection to confidence intervals greater than or equal to 95%, assuming sufficient sample volumes can be collected. The quantitative phase imaging provided by DHM allowed minerals to be distinguished from cells. Off-axis DHM's ability for rapid low-level bacterial detection and counting shows its viability as a technique for detection of extant microbial life provided that the cells can be captured intact and delivered to the sample chamber in a sufficient volume of liquid for imaging.

Molecular Line Emission as a Tool for Galaxy Observations (LEGO)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: formation; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: star formation	STAR-FORMATION RATE; ABUNDANCE VARIATIONS; GAS	Trends observed in galaxies, such as the Gao & Solomon relation, suggest a linear relationship between the star formation rate and the mass of dense gas available for star formation. Validation of such trends requires the establishment of reliable methods to trace the dense gas in galaxies. One frequent assumption is that the HCN (J = 1-0) transition is unambiguously associated with gas at H-2 densities >> 10(4) cm(-3). If so, the mass of gas at densities >> 10(4) cm(-3) could be inferred from the luminosity of this emission line, LHCN(1-0). Here we use observations of the Orion A molecular cloud to show that the HCN (J = 1-0) line traces much lower densities similar to 10(3) cm(-3) in cold sections of this molecular cloud, corresponding to visual extinctions AV approximate to 6 mag. We also find that cold and dense gas in a cloud like Orion produces too little HCN emission to explain LHCN(1-0) in star forming galaxies, suggesting that galaxies might contain a hitherto unknown source of HCN emission. In our sample of molecules observed at frequencies near 100 GHz (also including (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, (CO)-O-18, CN, and CCH), N2H+ is the only species clearly associated with relatively dense gas.

We find that the dispersion in the [C II](158) deficit of LIRGs is attributed to a varying fractional contribution of photodissociation regions (PDRs) to the observed [C II](158) emission, f ([C II](158)(PDR)) = [C II](158)(PDR)/C II](158), which increases from similar to 60% to similar to 95% in the warmest LIRGs. The [O I](63)/[C II](158)(PDR) ratio is tightly correlated with the PDR gas kinetic temperaturein sources where [O I] 63 is not optically thick or self-absorbed. For each galaxy, we derive the average PDR hydrogen density, n(H), and intensity of the interstellar radiation field, G, in units of G(0) and find G/n(H) ratios of similar to 0.1-50 G(0) cm(3), with ULIRGs populating the upper end of the distribution. There is a relation between G/n(H) and Sigma(IR), showing a critical break at Sigma(IR)* similar or equal to 5 x 10(10) L-circle dot kpc(-2). Below Sigma(IR)*, G/n(H) remains constant, similar or equal to 0.32G(0) cm(3), and variations in Sigma(IR) are driven by the number density of star-forming regions within a galaxy, with no change in their PDR properties. Above Sigma(IR)*, G/n(H) increases rapidly with Sigma(IR), signaling a departure from the typical PDR conditions found in normal star-forming galaxies toward more intense/harder radiation fields and compact geometries typical of starbursting sources.

CMB Polarization B-mode Delensing with SPTpol and Herschel	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; early universe; inflation	POWER SPECTRUM	We present a demonstration of delensing the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode polarization anisotropy. This process of reducing the gravitational-lensing-generated B-mode component will become increasingly important for improving searches for the B modes produced by primordial gravitational waves. In this work, we delens B-mode maps constructed from multi-frequency SPTpol observations of a 90 deg(2) patch of sky by subtracting a B-mode template constructed from two inputs: SPTpol E-mode maps and a lensing potential map estimated from the Herschel 500 mu m map of the cosmic infrared background. We find that our delensing procedure reduces the measured B-mode power spectrum by 28% in the multipole range 300 < l < 2300; this is shown to be consistent with expectations from simulations and to be robust against systematics. The null hypothesis of no delensing is rejected at 6.9 sigma. Furthermore, we build and use a suite of realistic simulations to study the general properties of the delensing process and find that the delensing efficiency achieved in this work is limited primarily by the noise in the lensing potential map. We demonstrate the importance of including realistic experimental non-idealities in the delensing forecasts used to inform instrument and survey-strategy planning of upcoming lower-noise experiments, such as CMB-S4.

Understanding the Ultraviolet Anomaly in NGC 5548 with X-Ray Spectroscopy	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: individual (NGC 5548); X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: individual (NGC 5548)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; WARM ABSORBER; XMM-NEWTON; ABSORPTION-LINES; SEYFERT-1; GALAXY; NGC-5548; MR-2251-178; DISCOVERY; NGC-3783	During the Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping Project observations of NGC 5548, the continuum and emission-line variability became decorrelated during the second half of the six-month-long observing campaign. Here we present Swift and Chandra X-ray spectra of NGC 5548 obtained as part of the campaign. The Swift spectra show that excess flux (relative to a power-law continuum) in the soft X-ray band appears before the start of the anomalous emission-line behavior, peaks during the period of the anomaly, and then declines. This is a model-independent result suggesting that the soft excess is related to the anomaly. We divide the Swift data into on-and off-anomaly spectra to characterize the soft excess via spectral fitting. The cause of the spectral differences is likely due to a change in the intrinsic spectrum rather than to variable obscuration or partial covering. The Chandra spectra have lower signal-to-noise ratios, but are consistent with the Swift data. Our preferred model of the soft excess is emission from an optically thick, warm Comptonizing corona, the effective optical depth of which increases during the anomaly. This model simultaneously explains all three observations: the UV emission-line flux decrease, the soft-excess increase, and the emission-line anomaly.	[Mathur, S.; Pogge, R. W.; Adams, S.

The Science Verification data span approximately 250 sq. deg. with a median i-band limiting magnitude for extended objects (10 sigma) of 23.0. The Year 1 data span approximately 2000 sq. deg. and have an i-band limiting magnitude for extended objects (10 sigma) of 22.9. As these data sets are both wide and deep, they are particularly useful for identifying strong gravitational lens candidates. Potential strong gravitational lens candidate systems were initially identified based on a color and magnitude selection in the DES object catalogs or because the system is at the location of a previously identified galaxy cluster. Cutout images of potential candidates were then visually scanned using an object viewer and numerically ranked according to whether or not we judged them to be likely strong gravitational lens systems. Having scanned nearly 400,000 cutouts, we present 374 candidate strong lens systems, of which 348 are identified for the first time. We provide the R.A. and decl., the magnitudes and photometric properties of the lens and source objects, and the distance (radius) of the source(s) from the lens center for each system.	[Diehl, H.

A heterogeneous lunar interior for hydrogen isotopes as revealed by the lunar highlands samples	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Moon; lunar magma ocean; water; hydrogen isotope; ferroan anorthosite; plagioclase	AMPHIBOLE WATER CONTENTS; VOLCANIC GLASSES; MELT INCLUSIONS; MARE BASALTS; MG-SUITE; ORIGIN; MOON; ANORTHOSITES; PETROLOGY; GEOCHEMISTRY	Knowing the amount and timing of water incorporation into the Moon has fundamental implications for our understanding of how the Earth-Moon system formed. Water has been detected in lunar samples but its abundance, distribution and origin are debated. To address these issues, we report water concentrations and hydrogen isotope ratios obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of plagioclase from ferroan anorthosites (FANs), the only available lithology thought to have crystallized directly from the lunar magma ocean (LMO). The measured water contents are consistent with previous results by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Combined with literature data, delta D values of lunar igneous materials least-degassed at the time of their crystallization range from 280 to +310 parts per thousand, the latter value being that of FAN 60015 corrected for cosmic ray exposure. We interpret these results as hydrogen isotopes being fractionated during degassing of molecular hydrogen (H-2) in the LMO, starting with the magmatic delta D value of primordial water at the beginning of LMO being about 280 parts per thousand, evolving to about +310 parts per thousand at the time of anorthite crystallization, i.e. during the formation of the primary lunar crust. The degassing of hydrogen in the LMO is consistent with those of other volatile elements. The wide range of delta D values observed in lunar igneous rocks could be due to either various degrees of mixing of the different mantle end members, or from a range of mantle sources that were degassed to different degrees during magma evolution. Degassing of the LMO is a viable mechanism that resulted in a heterogeneous lunar interior for hydrogen isotopes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Woo, HB; Panning, MP; Adams, PN; Dutton, A				Woo, Han Byul; Panning, Mark P.; Adams, Peter N.; Dutton, Andrea			Karst-driven flexural isostasy in North-Central Florida	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						karstification; isostatic uplift; lithospheric flexure; passive margin; marine terrace	DYNAMIC TOPOGRAPHY; LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION; ELASTIC THICKNESS; KARSTIFICATION; LITHOSPHERE; VARIABILITY; VISCOSITY; AMERICA; AQUIFER; UPLIFT	Deformed marine terraces can be used to explore a region's uplift history. Trail Ridge is a marine terrace in north Florida that is nearly 80 m above modern sea level and contains Quaternary marine fossils, a fact that is inconsistent with estimates of paleo-sea level history since the early Pleistocene. This implies that the terrace has experienced uplift since its formation, as well as nonuniform deformation recorded by the warping of its previously horizontal state. The Florida carbonate platform, located on the passive margin of eastern North America, is a setting where nontectonic influences (e.g. isostatic adjustment, dynamic topography) can be examined. We present a single-transect, numerical model of vertical displacement, derived from elastic flexure, to assess the influence of karst-driven isostatic uplift on present day topography of Trail Ridge in north Florida. Flexural modeling predicts elevations in central Florida not observed today, most likely because surface erosion and karst cavity collapse have obliterated this high topography. Older subsurface stratigraphic units, however, display the arched profile predicted from flexural modeling. Mass loss, calculated by differencing modeled topography and observed topography, was found to be 6.75 x1012 kg, since emplacement of Trail Ridge. Uplift rates, assuming karst-driven flexural isostasy alone, using previously estimated ages of Trail Ridge of 0.125, 1.4, 3, or 3.5 Ma were found to be 0.535, 0.048, 0.022, and 0.019 mm/yr, respectively. A more likely explanation of uplift includes contributions from dynamic topography and glacial isostatic adjustment which should be further explored with more advanced geophysical modeling.

J	Seroussi, H; Ivins, ER; Wiens, DA; Bondzio, J				Seroussi, Helene; Ivins, Erik R.; Wiens, Douglas A.; Bondzio, Johannes			Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						Marie Byrd Land; subglacial Lake Whillans; mantle plume; ice sheet; basal conditions	MARIE-BYRD-LAND; SUBGLACIAL LAKE ACTIVITY; NEW-ZEALAND; HEAT-FLOW; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; THWAITES GLACIER; SEISMIC EVIDENCE; GEOTHERMAL FLUX; THERMAL REGIME; WATER-SYSTEM	The possibility that a deep mantle plume manifests Pliocene and Quaternary volcanism and potential elevated heat flux in West Antarctica has been studied for more than 30 years. Recent seismic images support the plume hypothesis as the cause of Marie Byrd Land (MBL) volcanism and geophysical structure. Mantle plumes may more than double the geothermal heat flux above nominal continental values. A dearth of in situ ice sheet basal data exists that samples the heat flux. Consequently, we examine a realistic distribution of heat flux associated with a possible late Cenozoic mantle plume in West Antarctica and explore its impact on thermal and melt conditions at the ice sheet base. We use a simple analytical mantle plume parameterization to produce geothermal heat flux at the base of the ice sheet. The three-dimensional ice flow model includes an enthalpy framework and full-Stokes stress balance. As both the putative plume location and extent are uncertain, we perform broadly scoped experiments to characterize the impact of the plume on geothermal heat flux and ice sheet basal conditions. The experiments show that mantle plumes have an important local impact on the ice sheet, with basal melting rates reaching several centimeters per year directly above the hotspot. In order to be consistent with observations of basal hydrology in MBL, the upper bound on the plume-derived geothermal heat flux is 150 mW/m(2). In contrast, the active lake system of the lower part of Whillans Ice Stream suggests a widespread anomalous mantle heat flux, linked to a rift source.

Dropsonde Observations of Total Integrated Water Vapor Transport within North Pacific Atmospheric Rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article							US WEST-COAST; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; PRECIPITATION IMPACTS; HEAVY PRECIPITATION; UNITED-STATES; CALIFORNIA; MOISTURE; OCEAN; ALGORITHM; LANDFALLS	Aircraft dropsonde observations provide the most comprehensive measurements to date of horizontal water vapor transport in atmospheric rivers (ARs). The CalWater experiment recently more than tripled the number of ARs probed with the required measurements. This study uses vertical profiles of water vapor, wind, and pressure obtained from 304 dropsondes across 21 ARs. On average, total water vapor transport ( TIVT) in an AR was 4.7 x 10(8) +/- 2 x 10(8) kg s(-1). This magnitude is 2.6 times larger than the average discharge of liquid water from the Amazon River. The mean AR width was 890 +/- 270 km. Subtropical ARs contained larger integrated water vapor ( IWV) but weaker winds than midlatitude ARs, although average TIVTs were nearly the same. Mean TIVTs calculated by defining the lateral "edges'' of ARs using an IVT threshold versus an IWV threshold produced results that differed by less than 10% across all cases, but did vary between the midlatitudes and subtropical regions.

By leveraging the Chebyshev basis functions of MCPI, interpolation in 1 dimension may be used to target plane crossing events, instead of integrating the 42 dimensional variational equation required for standard step integrators. This results in dramatically improved performance over traditional differential correctors. MCPI was tested against the Runge-Kutta 7/8 integrator on over 45,000 halo orbits in three different three-body problems, and was found to be up to an order of magnitude faster, while simultaneously increasing robustness.

The shallow-water (possibly mudflat-like) habitat of the biocoenose is established by its geological setting and intimately intermixed association with millimetric quartz radiating laths and rosettes interpreted to be pseudomorphs after evaporitic gypsum/anhydrite. The indigenousness and syngenicity of the permineralized fossils to the encompassing chert; their uncompacted minimally altered "life-like" spatial distribution; and their biogenicity and bacterial affinity are shown by optical microscopic, Raman spectroscopic and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses in situ that document the mineralogy of their embedding matrix and their cylindrical filamentous morphology, cellularity, and kerogenous composition. By comparison with mid-Precambrian and modern sulfur-cycling ecosystems, and consistent with sulfur isotopic data and their intimate co-existence with copious microgranular pyrite and pseudomorphs evidently after sulfate, the swirled aggregates are interpreted to be anaerobic sulfuretums. In contrast, the intermixed flat laminated components, like microbes of fossil and modern stromatolitic mat communities, are interpreted to be co-occurring light-requiring phototrophs. Whether such phototrophs were anoxygenic photosynthesizers, like extant photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., chloroflexaleans) or facultatively anaerobic cyanobacteria (cf. Oscillatoria limnetica), their anoxygenic metabolism seems plausibly established. Given its great age, shallow water habitat, and anaerobic/microaerophilic physiology, this evidently first reported occurrence from the fossil record of anoxygenic phototrophs and of a microbial sulfuretum-phototroph consortium is consistent with the supposition that Earth's Paleoarchean environment was essentially anoxic and suggests that O-2-producing photosynthesis may have been a later evolutionary innovation.

High-performance coronagraphs can suppress the diffraction features and gain access to companions at small angular separation. However, the uncontrolled pointing errors degrade the coronagraphic performance by leaking starlight around the coronagraphic focal-plane mask, preventing the detection of companions at small separations. A Lyot-stop low-order wavefront sensor (LLOWFS) was therefore introduced to calibrate and measure these aberrations for focal-plane phase mask coronagraphs. This sensor quantifies the variations in wavefront error decomposed into a few Zernike modes by reimaging the diffracted starlight rejected by a reflective Lyot stop. The technique was tested with several coronagraphs on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system at the Subaru Telescope. The wavefront was decomposed into 15 and 35 Zernike modes with an occulting and focal-plane phase mask coronagraph, respectively, which were used to drive a closed-loop correction in the laboratory. Using a 2000-actuator deformable mirror, a closed-loop pointing stability between 10(-3) - 10(-4) lambda/D was achieved in the laboratory in H-band, with sub nanometer residuals for the other Zernike modes (Noll index >4). On-sky, the low-order control of 10+ Zernike modes for the phase-induced amplitude apodization and the vector vortex coronagraphs was demonstrated, with a closed-loop pointing stability of 10(-4) lambda/D under good seeing and 10(-3) lambda/D under moderate seeing conditions readily achievable.

We have developed and applied a novel inverse Abel transform algorithm on high rate RO total electron content measurements performed along GPS to CASSIOPE radio links to recover electron density profiles. The high-resolution density profiles inferred from the CASSIOPE RO are (1) in very good agreement with density profiles estimated from ionosonde data, measured over stations nearby to the latitude and longitude of the RO tangent points; (2) in good agreement with density profiles inferred from GPS RO measured by the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC); and (3) in general agreement with density profiles estimated using the International Reference Ionosphere climatological model. Using both CASSIOPE and COSMIC RO observations, we identify, for the first time, that there exist differences in the characteristics of the electron number density profiles retrieved over landmasses and oceans. The density profiles over oceans exhibit widespread values and scale heights compared to density profiles over landmasses. We provide an explanation for the ocean-landmass discrepancy in terms of the unique wave coupling mechanisms operating over oceans and landmasses.

GRACE Groundwater Drought Index: Evaluation of California Central Valley groundwater drought	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Groundwater drought; Remote sensing; Drought indices; GRACE	HIGH-PLAINS; WATER; DEPLETION; RECHARGE; AQUIFER; STRESS; SPACE	Quantitative approaches to assess the complexity of groundwater drought are hindered by the lack of direct observations of groundwater over space and time. Here, we present an approach to evaluate groundwater drought occurrence based on observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Normalized GRACE-derived groundwater storage deviations are shown to quantify groundwater storage deficits during the GRACE record, which we define as the GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI). As a case study, GGDI is applied over the Central Valley of California, a regional aquifer undergoing intensive human activities and subject to significant drought periods during the GRACE record. Relations between GGDI and other hydrological drought indices highlight our ability to capture drought delays unique to groundwater drought. Further, GGDI captures characteristics of groundwater drought that occur as a result of complex human activities and natural changes, thus presenting a framework to assess multi-driver groundwater drought characteristics.

Attenuation, as represented by vegetation optical depth (VOD), is a potentially useful ecological indicator. The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission carries significant potential for VOD estimates because of its radio frequency interference mitigation efforts and because the L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. In this study, we apply the multi-temporal dual-channel retrieval algorithm (MT-DCA) to derive global VOD, soil moisture, and effective scattering albedo estimates from SMAP Backus-Gilbert enhanced brightness temperatures posted on a 9 km grid and with three day revisit time. SMAP VOD values from the MT-DCA follow expected global distributions and are shown to be highly correlated with canopy height. They are also broadly similar in magnitude (though not always in seasonal amplitude) to European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) VOD. The SMOS VOD values are based on angular brightness temperature information while the SMAP measurements are at a constant incidence angle, requiring an alternate approach to VOD retrieval presented in this study. Globally, albedo values tend to be high over regions with heterogeneous land cover types. The estimated effective scattering albedo values are generally higher than those used in previous soil moisture estimation algorithms and linked to biome classifications. MT-DCA retrievals of soil moisture show only small random differences with soil moisture retrievals from the Baseline SMAP algorithm, which uses a prior estimate of VOD based on land cover and optical data. However, significant biases exist between the two datasets. The soil moisture biases follow the pattern of differences between the MT-DCA retrieved and Baseline-assigned VOD values.

Five of the six BiSON telescopes are located at major observatories. The observational sites are, in order of increasing longitude: Mount Wilson (Hale) Observatory (MWO), California, USA; Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; Observatorio del Teide, Izana, Tenerife, Canary Islands; the South African Astronomical Observatory, Sutherland, South Africa; Carnarvon, Western Australia; and the Paul Wild Observatory, Narrabri, New South Wales, Australia. The BiSON data may be used to measure atmospheric extinction coefficients in the I-c band (approximately 700-900 nm), and presented here are the derived atmospheric extinction coefficients from each site over the years 1984-2016.

Since rock textural images are usually inhomogeneous and manually hand-crafting features is not always reliable, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method to autonomously learn the feature representation for rock images. In our tests, rock image classification using the learned features shows that the learned features can outperform manually selected features. Self-taught learning is also proposed to learn the feature representation from a large database of unlabelled rock images of mixed class. The learned features can then be used repeatedly for classification of any subclass. This takes advantage of the large dataset of unlabelled rock images and learns a general feature representation for many kinds of rocks. We show experimental results supporting the feasibility of self-taught learning on rock images.

FIRE - Flyby of Io with Repeat Encounters: A conceptual design for a New Frontiers mission to Io	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Io; Volcanism; Radiation; Spacecraft	ENERGETIC PARTICLE; VOLCANIC PLUMES; JUPITER SYSTEM; HORIZONS; MOUNTAINS; SATELLITES; ERUPTIONS; INSIGHTS; PATERAE; WATER	A conceptual design is presented for a low complexity, heritage-based flyby mission to Io, Jupiter's innermost Galilean satellite and the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. The design addresses the 2011 Decadal Survey's recommendation for a New Frontiers class mission to Io and is based upon the result of the June 2012 NASA-JPL Planetary Science Summer School. A science payload is proposed to investigate the link between the structure of To's interior, its volcanic activity, its surface composition, and its tectonics. A study of Io's atmospheric processes and To's role in the Jovian magnetosphere is also planned. The instrument suite includes a visible/near-IR imager, a magnetic field and plasma suite, a dust analyzer, and a gimbaled high gain antenna to perform radio science. Payload activity and spacecraft operations would be powered by three Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRG). The primary mission includes 10 flybys with close-encounter altitudes as low as 100 km. The mission risks are mitigated by ensuring that relevant components are radiation tolerant and by using redundancy and flight-proven parts in the design. The spacecraft would be launched on an Atlas V rocket with a delta-v of 1.3 km/s. Three gravity assists (Venus, Earth, Earth) would be used to reach the Jupiter system in a 6-year cruise. The resulting concept demonstrates the rich scientific return of a flyby mission to Io. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We utilize the COSMOLIKE software to simulate results from a Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) like data set, specifically, we (1) compare individual and joint analyses of the different probes, (2) vary the selection criteria for lens and source galaxies, (3) investigate the impact of blending, (4) investigate the impact of the assumed cosmological model in multiprobe covariances, (6) quantify information content as a function of scales and (7) explore the impact of intrinsic galaxy alignment in a multiprobe context. Our analyses account for all cross-correlations within and across probes and include the higher-order (non-Gaussian) terms in the multiprobe covariance matrix. We simultaneously model cosmological parameters and a variety of systematics, e.g. uncertainties arising from shear and photo-z calibration, cluster mass-observable relation, galaxy intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias (up to 54 parameters altogether). We highlight two results: first, increasing the number density of source galaxies by similar to 30 per cent, which corresponds to solving blending for LSST, only gains little information. Secondly, including small scales in clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, by utilizing halo occupation distribution models, can substantially boost cosmological constraining power.

However, unresolved issues related to the spatial, spectral, and temporal dynamics of vegetation fluorescence complicate our ability to interpret SIF measurements. We developed an instrument to measure leaf-level gas exchange simultaneously with pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) and spectrally resolved fluorescence over the same field of view - allowing us to investigate the relationships between active and passive fluorescence with photosynthesis. Strongly correlated, slope-dependent relationships were observed between measured spectra across all wavelengths (Fk, 670-850 nm) and PAM fluorescence parameters under a range of actinic light intensities (steady-state fluorescence yields, Ft) and saturation pulses (maximal fluorescence yields, Fm). Our results suggest that this method can accurately reproduce the full Chl emission spectra - capturing the spectral dynamics associated with changes in the yields of fluorescence, photochemical (FPSII), and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). We discuss how this method may establish a link between photosynthetic capacity and the mechanistic drivers of wavelength-specific fluorescence emission during changes in environmental conditions (light, temperature, humidity). Our emphasis is on future research directions linking spectral fluorescence to photosynthesis, FPSII, and NPQ.
