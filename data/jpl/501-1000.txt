Ridging Associated with Drought across the Western and Southwestern United States: Characteristics, Trends, and Predictability Sources	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Atmosphere; North America; Atmospheric circulation; Drought; Pattern detection	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; WEATHER FORECASTS; SIERRA-NEVADA; NORTH PACIFIC; ANNUAL CYCLE; EL-NINO; PRECIPITATION; CALIFORNIA; CLIMATE	Persistent winter ridging events are a consistent feature of meteorological drought across the western and southwestern United States. In this study, a ridge detection algorithm is developed and applied on daily geopotential height anomalies to track and quantify the diversity of individual ridge characteristics (e.g., position, frequency, magnitude, extent, and persistence). Three dominant ridge types are shown to play important, but differing, roles for influencing the location of landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs), precipitation, and subsequently meteorological drought. For California, a combination of these ridge types is important for influencing precipitation deficits on daily through seasonal time scales, indicating the various pathways by which ridging can induce drought. Furthermore, both the frequency of ridge types and reduced AR activity are necessary features for explaining drought variability on seasonal time scales across the western and southwestern regions. The three ridge types are found to be associated in different ways with various remote drivers and modes of variability, highlighting possible sources of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability. A comparison between ridge types shows that anomalously large and persistent ridging events relate to different Rossby wave trains across the Pacific with different preferential upstream locations of tropical heating. For the "South-ridge" type, centered over the Southwest, a positive trend is found in both the frequency and persistence of these events across recent decades, likely contributing to observed regional drying. These results illustrate the utility of feature tracking for characterizing a wider range of ridging features that collectively influence precipitation deficits and drought.

Gravitational signatures of atmospheric thermal tides on Venus	ICARUS			English	Article							MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; GRAVITY RECOVERY; CIRCULATION; ROTATION; MISSION; TRACKING; MODEL; WAVES; FIELD	Thermal tides in the atmosphere of Venus transport a considerable amount of mass, on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We use simulated values of the surface atmospheric pressure distribution to estimate the time-varying gravitational potential, exterior to Venus. The expected amplitudes of gravitational signatures of thermal tides are below the errors from existing Magellan mission Doppler data, and have not yet been detected. However, they are large enough that we expect them to be well resolved by any of several measurement configurations for future Venus gravity missions.

Global and regional model simulations of atmospheric ammonia	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Atmospheric ammonia; Aerosol; Agricultural emissions, global loss; Global burden; Atmospheric life-time; Satellite measurement	INTERMEDIATES CRI MECHANISM; BIOMASS BURNING EMISSIONS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; UNITED-STATES; AIR-QUALITY; WRF-CHEM; DIURNAL-VARIATION; LAGRANGIAN MODEL; TRANSPORT MODEL; DRY DEPOSITION	Ammonia (NH3) is a basic gas of significant atmospheric interest because of its role in the possible formation of fine particulates and because it is a source of fixed nitrogen in soils and plants. NH3 processing in the atmosphere has been simulated using two 3-D models: the global chemistry transport model, STOCHEM-CRI and the regional coupled meteorological-chemical model, WRF-Chem-CRI. From analysis of STOCHEM-CRI simulations, NH3 removal fluxes of dry deposition (24.6 Tg(N)/yr), wet deposition (20.8 Tg(N)/yr), NH4+ formation (25.6 Tg(N)/yr) and reaction with OH (1.7 Tg(N)/yr) have been calculated, making a global annual average burden of 0.22 Tg(N) and life-time of 1.1 days. The gas-phase loss by OH, NO3 and stabilized Criegee intermediates contribute 2.3%, < 1% and < 1%, respectively to the total global loss of tropospheric NH3. The highest concentrations of NH3 are found to be in the region of South and East Asia, which are associated mostly with agricultural NH3 emissions. Loss of surface NH3 by reaction with OH increases by up to 25% along the equator because of the abundances of ozone. Comparison of satellite observations and model results give a better understanding of the temporal and spatial variations of atmospheric NH3 on a global and regional scales. Using the anthropogenic seasonal NH3 emission class in the model gives a poor representation of seasonal NH3. The positive bias in Africa and South America for all seasons is likely due to undetermined sources in the model such as underestimated biomass burning emissions of NH3 adopted in the model. The regional model results over North-West Europe during summer months are biased low compared with the measurements-suggesting either missing sources, or too efficient loss processes in the region.

Surface acoustic wave devices with an electromechanical coupling of 3.2% and an out-of-band rejection as high as 18dB are demonstrated using the excellent piezoelectric properties of ScAlN and low acoustic loss of 3C-SiC. Additionally, a large piezoresistive effect in the low-doped n-type 3C-SiC(100) thin film has been observed, which exceeds the previously reported values in any SiC thin films. The growth of the n-type 3C-SiC thin film was performed using the low pressure chemical vapor deposition technique at 1250 degrees C and the standard micro-electro-mechanical systems process is used for the fabrication of 3C-SiC piezoresistors. The piezoresistive effect was measured using the bending beam method in different crystallographic orientations. The maximum gauge factor is -47 for the longitudinal [100] orientation. Using the longitudinal and transverse gauge factors for different crystallographic orientations, the fundamental piezoresistive coefficients of the low-doped n-type 3C-SiC thin film are measured to be pi(11) = (-14.5 +/- 1.3) x 10(-11) Pa-1, pi(12) = (5.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-11) Pa-1, and pi(44) = (-1.7 +/- 0.7) x 10(-11) Pa-1.

J	Dong, JH; Fox-Kemper, B; Zhang, H; Dong, CM				Dong, Jihai; Fox-Kemper, Baylor; Zhang, Hong; Dong, Changming			The Seasonality of Submesoscale Energy Production, Content, and Cascade	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Submesoscale; Kuroshio extension; mixed layer instability; nonlinear interaction; energy cascade	CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; MIXED-LAYER INSTABILITIES; PART I; MESOSCALE; PARAMETERIZATION; TRANSITION; GULF; TRANSPORT; IMPACTS; EDDIES	Submesoscale processes in the upper ocean vary seasonally, in tight correspondence with mixed layer thickness variability. Based on a global high-resolution MITgcm simulation, seasonal evaluation of strong vorticity and spectral analysis of the kinetic energy in the Kuroshio Extension System show the strongest submesoscales occur in March, implying a lag of about a month behind mixed layer thickness maximum in February. An analysis of spectral energy sources and transfers indicates that the seasonality of the submesoscale energy content is a result of the competition between the conversion of available potential energy into submesoscale kinetic energy via a buoyancy production/vertical buoyancy flux associated with mixed layer instability and nonlinear energy transfers to other scales associated with an energy cascade. The buoyancy production is seasonally in phase with the mixed layer depth, but the transfers of energy across scales makes energizing the reservoir of submesoscale kinetic energy lag behind by a month. Plain Language Summary Submesoscale processes have spatial and temporal scales of O(1-10) km and O(1) day, linking the meso- and micro-scales. Previous works reveal that mixed layer instability, which has extraction rates scaled with mixed layer depth, releases potential energy for the generation of submesoscale kinetic energy in the upper ocean. However, the seasonality of submesoscale kinetic energy in the Kuroshio Extension System region is determined not only by the potential energy releasing due to the mixed layer instability, but also by the energy transfers between different scales.

In the current study, we show that further increases to the electronic mobility and simultaneous reductions to the lattice thermal conductivity can be achieved by isovalent alloying with Bi on the Sb site in the Eu2ZnSb2-xBix series (x = 0, 0.25, 1, 2). Upon alloying with Bi, the effective mass decreases and the mobility linearly increases, showing no signs of reduction due to alloy scattering. Analysis of the pair distribution functions obtained from synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed significant local structural distortions caused by the half-occupied Zn site in this structure type. It is all the more surprising, therefore, to find that Eu2ZnBi2 possesses high electronic mobility (similar to 100 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) comparable to that of AM(2)X(2) Zintl compounds. The enormous degree of disorder in this series gives rise to exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity, which is further reduced by Bi substitution due to the decreased speed of sound. Increasing the Bi content was also found to decrease the band gap while increasing the carrier concentration by two orders of magnitude. Applying a single parabolic band model suggests that Bi-rich compositions of Eu2ZnSb2-xBix have the potential for significantly improved zT; however, further optimization is necessary through reduction of the carrier concentration to realize high zT.

Impact of Cloud Ice Particle Size Uncertainty in a Climate Model and Implications for Future Satellite Missions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; A-TRAIN; PARAMETERIZATION; SENSITIVITY	Ice particle size is pivotal to determining ice cloud radiative effect and precipitating rate. However, there is a lack of accurate ice particle effective radius (Rei) observation on the global scale to constrain its representation in climate models. In support of future mission design, here we present a modeling assessment of the sensitivity of climate simulations to R-ei and quantify the impact of the proposed mission concept on reducing the uncertainty in climate sensitivity. We perturb the parameters pertaining to ice fall speed parameter and R-ei in radiation scheme, respectively, in National Center for Atmospheric Research CESM1 model with a slab ocean configuration. The model sensitivity experiments show that a settling velocity increase due to a larger R-ei results in a longwave cooling dominating over a shortwave warming, a global mean surface temperature decrease, and precipitation suppression. A similar competition between longwave and shortwave cloud forcing changes also exists when perturbing R-ei in the radiation scheme. Linearity generally holds for the climate response for R-ei related parameters. When perturbing falling snow particle size (R-es) in a similar way, we find much less sensitivity of climate responses. Our quadrupling CO2 experiments with different parameter settings reveal that R-ei and R-es can account for changes in climate sensitivity significantly from +12.3% to -6.2%. By reducing the uncertainty ranges of R-ei and R-es from a factor of 2 to +/- 25%, a future satellite mission under design is expected to improve the climate state simulations and reduce the climate sensitivity uncertainty pertaining to ice particle size by approximately 60%. Our results highlight the importance of better observational constraints on R-ei by satellite missions.

Global partitioning of runoff generation mechanisms using remote sensing data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							GRACE; VARIABILITY; PATTERNS; IMPACT	A set of complex processes contribute to generate river runoff, which in the hydrological sciences are typically divided into two major categories: surface runoff, sometimes called Hortonian flow, and baseflow-driven runoff or Dunne flow. In this study, we examine the covariance of global satellite-based surface water inundation (SWI) observations with two remotely sensed hydrological variables, precipitation, and terrestrial water storage, to better understand how apparent runoff generation responds to these two dominant forcing mechanisms in different regions of the world. Terrestrial water storage observations come from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, while precipitation comes from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) combined product, and surface inundation levels from the NASA Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS) product. We evaluate the statistical relationship between surface water inundation, total water storage anomalies (TWS; TWSAs), and precipitation values under different time lag and quality control adjustments between the data products. We find that the global estimation of surface inundation improves when considering a quality control threshold of 50 % reliability for the SWAMPS data and after applying time lags ranging from 1 to 5 months. Precipitation and total water storage equally control the majority of surface inundation developments across the globe. The model tends to underestimate and overestimate at locations with high interannual variability and with low inundation measurements, respectively.	[Lucey, Joseph T.

J	MacDonald, M; Kurowski, MJ; Teixeira, J				MacDonald, Michael; Kurowski, Marcin J.; Teixeira, Joao			Direct Numerical Simulation of the Moist Stably Stratified Surface Layer: Turbulence and Fog Formation	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Direct numerical simulation; Fog formation; Stable surface layer	LARGE-EDDY-SIMULATION; RADIATION FOG; CHANNEL FLOW; ATTACHED EDDIES; WALL; CLOUD; PHYSICS; MODEL; CONDENSATION; STABILITY	We investigate the effects of condensation and liquid water loading on the stably stratified surface layer, with an eye towards understanding the influence of turbulent mixing on fog formation. Direct numerical simulations of dry and moist open-channel flows are conducted, where in both a constant cooling rate is applied at the ground to mimic longwave radiative cooling. Depending on the cooling rate, this can lead to either turbulent (weakly stable) or laminar (very stable) flows. Compared to the completely dry case, the condensation of liquid water in the moist case enables slightly higher cooling rates to be achieved before leading to turbulence collapse. In the very stable cases, runaway cooling leads to the substantial condensation of liquid water close to the ground and fog (visibility less than 1 km) results over much of the domain. In the weakly stable cases, turbulent mixing narrowly yields visibilities of 1 km close to the ground over a similar time period. However, despite the idealized nature of the system, the present results suggest that turbulence impedes, although will not necessarily inhibit, fog formation. A possible mechanism for fog formation within turbulent flows is identified, wherein regions of increased liquid water content form within the low-speed streaks of the near-wall cycle. These streaks are energized in the moist cases due to reduced dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy compared to the dry case, although in both cases the streaks are less energetic and persistent than in neutrally-stratified flow.

An intercomparison of tropospheric ozone reanalysis products from CAMS, CAMS interim, TCR-1, and TCR-2	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							CARBON-MONOXIDE; DATA ASSIMILATION; AIR-POLLUTION; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; SURFACE OZONE; DATA SET; EMISSION; MODEL; NO2	Global tropospheric ozone reanalyses constructed using different state-of-the-art satellite data assimilation systems, prepared as part of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS-iRean and CAMS-Rean) as well as two fully independent reanalyses (TCR-1 and TCR-2, Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis), have been intercompared and evaluated for the past decade. The updated reanalyses (CAMS-Rean and TCR-2) generally show substantially improved agreements with independent ground and ozone-sonde observations over their predecessor versions (CAMS-iRean and TCR-1) for diurnal, synoptical, seasonal, and interannual variabilities. For instance, for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes the tropospheric ozone columns (surface to 300 hPa) from the updated reanalyses show mean biases to within 0.8 DU (Dobson units, 3 % relative to the observed column) with respect to the ozone-sonde observations. The improved performance can likely be attributed to a mixture of various upgrades, such as revisions in the chemical data assimilation, including the assimilated measurements, and the forecast model performance. The updated chemical reanalyses agree well with each other for most cases, which highlights the usefulness of the current chemical reanalyses in a variety of studies. Meanwhile, significant temporal changes in the reanalysis quality in all the systems can be attributed to discontinuities in the observing systems. To improve the temporal consistency, a careful assessment of changes in the assimilation configuration, such as a detailed assessment of biases between various retrieval products, is needed. Our comparison suggests that improving the observational constraints, including the continued development of satellite observing systems, together with the optimization of model parameterizations such as deposition and chemical reactions, will lead to increasingly consistent long-term reanalyses in the future.

We show that the modes may be understood in terms of the symmetry breaking that occurs when an infinite cylinder is folded to form a torus. This symmetry breaking results in the splitting of the transverse cylinder modes into two distinct sets of modes on a torus. One set of these modes was known to exist already. We show the existence of the second set and also analytically derive the surface charge structure for that set of modes. We also consolidate recent advances made in studying the modal structure on torus particles and complete our understanding of the plasmonic modes of a torus.

Although this effect has been studied in the past decade, the mechanisms and impacts of this enhancement over South America remain poorly understood. Over the Amazon deforestation arch large amounts of aerosols are released into the atmosphere due to biomass burning, which provides an ideal scenario for further investigation of this phenomenon in the presence of canopies with complex architecture. In this paper, the relation of aerosol optical depth and surface fluxes of mass and energy are evaluated over three study sites with artificial neural networks and radiative transfer modeling. Results indicate a significant effect of the aerosol on the flux of carbon dioxide between the vegetation and the atmosphere, as well as on energy exchange, including that surface fluxes are sensitive to second-order radiative impacts of aerosols on temperature, humidity, and friction velocity. CO2 exchanges increased in the presence of aerosol in up to 55 % in sites with complex canopy architecture. A decrease of approximately 12 % was observed for a site with shorter vegetation. Energy fluxes were negatively impacted by aerosols over all study sites.

J	Zheng, XJ; Xi, BK; Dong, XQ; Logan, T; Wang, Y; Wu, P				Zheng, Xiaojian; Xi, Baike; Dong, Xiquan; Logan, Timothy; Wang, Yuan; Wu, Peng			Investigation of aerosol-cloud interactions under different absorptive aerosol regimes using Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) southern Great Plains (SGP) ground-based measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MIDLATITUDE CONTINENTAL CLOUDS; BIOMASS BURNING SMOKE; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUD; MEGA-CITY GUANGZHOU; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CONDENSATION NUCLEI; LONG-TERM; WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE; SUBMICROMETER AEROSOL; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION	The aerosol indirect effect on cloud microphysical and radiative properties is one of the largest uncertainties in climate simulations. In order to investigate the aerosol-cloud interactions, a total of 16 low-level stratus cloud cases under daytime coupled boundary-layer conditions are selected over the southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States. The physicochemical properties of aerosols and their impacts on cloud microphysical properties are examined using data collected from the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) facility at the SGP site. The aerosol-cloud interaction index (ACI(r)) is used to quantify the aerosol impacts with respect to cloud-droplet effective radius. The mean value of ACI(r) calculated from all selected samples is 0.145 +/- 0.05 and ranges from 0.09 to 0.24 at a range of cloud liquid water paths (LWPs; LWP = 20-300 g m(-2)). The magnitude of ACI(r) decreases with an increasing LWP, which suggests a diminished cloud microphysical response to aerosol loading, presumably due to enhanced condensational growth processes and enlarged particle sizes. The impact of aerosols with different light-absorbing abilities on the sensitivity of cloud microphysical responses is also investigated. In the presence of weak light-absorbing aerosols, the low-level clouds feature a higher number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (N-CCN) and smaller effective radii (r(e)), while the opposite is true for strong light-absorbing aerosols. Furthermore, the mean activation ratio of aerosols to CCN (N-CCN/N-a) for weakly (strongly) absorbing aerosols is 0.54 (0.45), owing to the aerosol microphysical effects, particularly the different aerosol compositions inferred by their absorptive properties. In terms of the sensitivity of cloud-droplet number concentration (N-d) to N-CCN, the fraction of CCN that converted to cloud droplets (N-d/N-CCN) for the weakly (strongly) absorptive regime is 0.69 (0.54). The measured ACI(r) values in the weakly absorptive regime are relatively higher, indicating that clouds have greater microphysical responses to aerosols, owing to the favorable thermodynamic condition. The reduced ACI(r) values in the strongly absorptive regime are due to the cloud-layer heating effect induced by strong light-absorbing aerosols. Consequently, we expect larger shortwave radiative cooling effects from clouds in the weakly absorptive regime than those in the strongly absorptive regime.

Powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy show that Fe is not incorporated into the Yb14MgSb11 structure. First-order reversal curves and scanning electron microscopy images show that the Fe inclusions are larger and closer together with increasing Fe content. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry show that the composites are stable up to 1273 K. The elastic constants of the 8 vol % Fe composite were measured by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and show that Yb14MgSb11 becomes stiffer with increasing Fe volume % and SEM after indentations show crack arresting occurs at the Fe interface. Thermoelectric properties on dense pellets are measured from 300 K - 1273 K. The thermoelectric power factor (PF = S-2/rho) increases with increasing Fe content, with the 8 vol % Fe resulting in 40% higher PF than pristine Yb14MgSb11. The increase in PF is attributed to a systematic reduction in electrical resistivity. Peak thermoelectric figure of merit [zT = ((ST)-T-2)/(kappa rho)] is observed at 3 vol % Fe, an 11% improvement in zT compared to Yb14MgSb11. Yb14MgSb11 composites with Fe are compatible with Ce0.9Fe3.5Co0.5Sb12 for thermoelectric generator couple segmentation.

Our aim is to quantify the impact of systematic effects on the inference of cosmological parameters from cosmic shear.Methods. We present an "end-to-end" approach that introduces sources of bias in a modelled weak lensing survey on a galaxy-by-galaxy level. We propagated residual biases through a pipeline from galaxy properties at one end to cosmic shear power spectra and cosmological parameter estimates at the other end. We did this to quantify how imperfect knowledge of the pipeline changes the maximum likelihood values of dark energy parameters.Results. We quantify the impact of an imperfect correction for charge transfer inefficiency and modelling uncertainties of the point spread function for Euclid, and find that the biases introduced can be corrected to acceptable levels.

They simulate dynamic multispecies assemblages over multiple tree-generations and predict forest responses to altered environmental conditions. Their development emphases designation of the significant biological and ecological processes at appropriate time/space scales. Conceptually, they are with consistent with A.G. Tansley's original definition of "the ecosystem". Results An example microscale application inspects feedbacks among terrestrial vegetation change, air-quality changes from the vegetation's release of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and climate change effects on ecosystem production of VOC's. Gap models can allocate canopy photosynthate to the individual trees whose leaves form the vertical leaf-area profiles. VOC release depends strongly on leaf physiology by species of these trees. Leaf-level VOC emissions increase with climate-warming. Species composition change lowers the abundance of VOC-emitting taxa. In interactions among ecosystem functions and biosphere/atmosphere exchanges, community composition responses can outweigh physiological responses. This contradicts previous studies that emphasize the warming-induced impacts on leaf function. As a mesoscale example, the changes in climate (warming) on forests including pest-insect dynamics demonstrates changes on the both the tree and the insect populations. This is but one of many cases that involve using a gap model to simulate changes in spatial units typical of sampling plots and scaling these to landscape and regional levels. As this is the typical application scale for gap models, other examples are identified. The insect/climate-change can be scaled to regional consequences by simulating survey plots across a continental or subcontinental zone. Forest inventories at these scales are often conducted using independent survey plots distributed across a region. Model construction that mimics this sample design avoids the difficulties in modelling spatial interactions, but we also discuss simulation at these scales with contagion effects. Conclusions At the global-scale, successful simulations to date have used functional types of plants, rather than tree species. In a final application, the fine-scale predictions of a gap model are compared with data from micrometeorological eddy-covariance towers and then scaled-up to produce maps of global patterns of evapotranspiration, net primary production, gross primary production and respiration. New active-remote-sensing instruments provide opportunities to test these global predictions.	[Shugart, H.

Distribution of Water Vapor in Molecular Clouds. II	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							C-12/C-13 ISOTOPE RATIO; ROTATIONAL-EXCITATION; ORION; HCN; ICE; CO; DENSITY; REGIONS; OMC-1; N2H+	The depth-dependent abundance of both gas-phase and solid-state water within dense, quiescent, molecular clouds is important to both the cloud chemistry and gas cooling. Where water is in the gas phase, it is free to participate in the network of ion-neutral reactions that lead to a host of oxygen-bearing molecules, and its many ortho- and para-energy levels make it an effective coolant for gas temperatures greater than 20 K. Where water is abundant as ice on grain surfaces, and unavailable to cool the gas, significant amounts of oxygen are removed from the gas phase, suppressing the gas-phase chemical reactions that lead to a number of oxygen-bearing species, including O-2. Models of far-UV (FUV)-illuminated clouds predict that the gas-phase water abundance peaks in the range AV similar to 3 and 8 mag of the cloud surface, depending on the gas density and FUV field strength. Deeper within such clouds, water is predicted to exist mainly as ice on grain surfaces. More broadly, these models are used to analyze a variety of other regions, including outflow cavities associated with young stellar objects and the surface layers of protoplanetary disks. In this paper, we report the results of observational tests of FUV-illuminated cloud models toward the Orion Molecular Ridge and Cepheus B using data obtained from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory. Toward Orion, 2220 spatial positions were observed along the face-on Orion Ridge in the H2O 1(10) - 1(01) 557 GHz and NH3 J, K = 1,0-0,0 572 GHz lines. Toward Cepheus B, two strip scans were made in the same lines across the edge-on ionization front. These new observations demonstrate that gas-phase water exists primarily within a few magnitudes of dense cloud surfaces, strengthening the conclusions of an earlier study based on a much smaller data set, and indirectly supports the prediction that water ice is quite abundant in dense clouds.

Our multi-band photometry enables stellar-mass measurements in the cluster member galaxies down to a mass limit of M = 3 x 108 M (0.1 of the Large Magellanic Cloud stellar mass). We observe a clear difference in the spatial distribution of large and dwarf galaxies within the cluster. Modeling these galaxy populations separately, we can confidently track the distribution of stellar mass locked in the galaxies to the cluster's virial radius. The extended envelope of the cluster's brightest galaxy can be tracked to 200 kpc. The central galaxy contributes 1/3 of the total cluster stellar mass within the radius r(500c).

Analysing the nuclear surface brightness profiles of 12 newly imaged slow rotators, we classify their light profiles as core-less, and place an upper limit to the core size of about 10 pc. Considering the full magnitude and volume-limited ATLAS(3D) sample, we correlate the presence or lack of cores with stellar kinematics, including the proxy for the stellar angular momentum (lambda(Re)) and the velocity dispersion within one half-light radius (sigma(e)), stellar mass, stellar age, alpha-element abundance, and age and metallicity gradients. More than half of the slow rotators have core-less light profiles, and they are all less massive than 10(11) M-circle dot. Core-less slow rotators show evidence for counter-rotating flattened structures, have steeper metallicity gradients, and a larger dispersion of gradient values ((Delta[Z/H]) over bar = -0.42 +/- 0.18) than core slow rotators (Delta[Z/H]) over bar = -0.23 +/- 0.07). Our results suggest that core and core-less slow rotators have different assembly processes, where the former, as previously discussed, are the relics of massive dissipation-less merging in the presence of central supermassive black holes. Formation processes of core-less slow rotators are consistent with accretion of counter-rotating gas or gas-rich mergers of special orbital configurations, which lower the final net angular momentum of stars, but support star formation. We also highlight core fast rotators as galaxies that share properties of core slow rotators (i.e. cores, ages, sigma(e), and population gradients) and core-less slow rotators (i.e. kinematics, lambda(Re), mass, and larger spread in population gradients). Formation processes similar to those for core-less slow rotators can be invoked to explain the assembly of core fast rotators, with the distinction that these processes form or preserve cores.

These studies, necessary to assess and characterize the noise level and robustness of the differential phase shift (Delta Phi) observable of polarimetric radio occultations (PROs), confirm the good performance of the experiment and the capability of this technique in sensing precipitation. It is shown how all the predicted effects that could have an impact into the PRO observables (e.g., effect of metallic structures nearby the antenna, the Faraday rotation at the ionosphere, signal impurities in the transmission, and altered cross-polarization isolation) are effectively calibrated and corrected, and they have a negligible effect on the final observable. The on-orbit calibration, performed using an extensive dataset of free-of-rain and low-ionospheric activity observations, is successfully used to correct all the collected observations, which are further validated against independent precipitation observations confirming the sensitivity of the observables to the presence of hydrometeors. The validation results also show how vertically averaged can be Delta Phi used as a proxy for precipitation.	[Padulles, Ramon; Ao, Chi O.; Turk, F.

Unlike graphite, a stable SEI that facilitates charge transfer is rarely formed on Li in any electrolyte, and requires an "engineered" interface. The interfacial stability of Li can be improved in both liquid and solid electrolytes by thin coatings of AlF3 using atomic layer deposition.

However, the extent to which the pattern of regional sea level rise measured by altimeters is representative of the forced sea level response remains an open question. Internal variability both contributes to regional sea level changes on short time scales and masks the pattern of forced trend and acceleration associated with anthropogenic global warming. Recent studies have demonstrated that the forced trend pattern of regional rise has begun to emerge, although there has been no assessment of a possible associated acceleration. Here, the regional acceleration pattern is estimated from the altimeter sea level record and assessed with regard to the influence of internal variability. While the dominant features in the acceleration pattern can be attributed to internal variability, there is an indication that the forced acceleration pattern may emerge as the record continues to lengthen.

Satellite detection of varying seasonal water supply restrictions on grassland productivity in the Missouri basin, USA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; GRACE; MODIS; Satellite soil moisture; Total water storage; Water limitation on plant productivity; Seasonal timing; Grassland	SOIL-MOISTURE; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; PLANT-RESPONSES; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; CLIMATE; SURFACE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ECOSYSTEMS	Climate observations indicate more frequent drought in recent years, and model predictions suggest that drought occurrence will continue to rise with global warming. Understanding drought impacts on ecosystem functioning requires accurate quantification of vegetation sensitivity to changes in water supply condition. This is complicated by the seasonal variation in plant structural and physiological response to water stress, especially for semi-arid grasslands with characteristic strong spatial and temporal variability in carbon uptake. Here, we use complementary satellite soil moisture (SM) and total water storage (TWS) observations to delineate plant-accessible water supply variations for natural grasslands in the Missouri basin, USA. We evaluate how water supply influences the spatiotemporal variations in grassland productivity as a function of seasonal timing and climate condition. We identify a 128-day period from mid-June to early October when grassland growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes. We find the strongest SM sensitivity after the peak of the growing season associated with high temperature and VPD. SM limitation can extend to early and late growing season under warm conditions, while grassland sensitivity to SM is generally stronger in the late growth stage than in the green-up period given similar temperature and soil moisture. We find that complementary to the surface SM observations, TWS provides plant-available water storage information from the deeper soil, and both SM and TWS exert a lagged impact on grassland productivity. We find that the lag between the inter-annual variation of SM and associated plant response increases through the season, and overall there is a transition from SM-limitation to TWS-limitation on productivity during the late growing period when the TWS level is near the seasonal low. Future global change projections should account for a seasonally varying vegetation-moisture relationship to accurately assess the impact of the water supply constraint on plant productivity in a warming climate.

Nevertheless, retrieval of the accurate high spatial resolution soil moisture maps that are required to satisfy hydro-meteorological and agricultural applications remains a challenge. Currently, a variety of downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation techniques have been proposed as the solution to disaggregate the coarse passive microwave soil moisture into high-to-medium resolutions. These techniques take advantage of the strengths of both the passive microwave observations of soil moisture having low spatial resolution and the spatially detailed information on land surface features that either influence or represent soil moisture variability. However, such techniques have typically been developed and tested individually under differing weather and climate conditions, meaning that there is no clear guidance on which technique performs the best. Consequently, this paper presents a quantitative assessment of the existing radar-, optical-, radiometer-, and oversampling-based downscaling techniques using a singular extensive data set collected specifically for that purpose, being the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx)-4 and -5 airborne field campaigns, and the OzNet in situ stations, to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of their performances. The oversampling-based soil moisture product best captured the temporal and spatial variability of the reference soil moisture overall, though the radar-based products had a better temporal agreement with airborne soil moisture during the short SMAPEx-4 period. Moreover, the difference between temporal analysis of products against in situ and airborne soil moisture reference data sets pointed to the fact that relying on in situ measurements alone is not appropriate for validation of spatially enhanced soil moisture maps.

A framework for harmonizing multiple satellite instruments to generate a long-term global high spatial-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SIP; Multi-instrument harmonization; Downscaling; GOME-2; SCIAMACHY; Machine learning; CDF matching	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LIGHT-USE EFFICIENCY; FIELD SPECTROSCOPY; CANOPY SCATTERING; RED FLUORESCENCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RETRIEVAL; DROUGHT	Several decade-long satellite retrievals of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIP) have become available during the past few years, but understanding the long-term dynamics of SIF and elucidating its co-variation with historical gross primary production (GPP) remains a challenge. Part of the challenge is due to the lack of direct comparability among these SIF products as they are derived from various satellite platforms with different retrieval methods, instruments characteristics, overpass time, and viewing-illumination geometries. This study presents a framework that circumvents these discrepancies and allows the harmonization of SIF products from multiple instruments to achieve long-term coverage. We demonstrate this framework by fusing SIF retrievals from SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) onboard MetOp-A developed at German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ). We first downscale both original SIF datasets from their native resolutions to 0.05 degrees ((SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) respectively) using machine learning (ML) algorithms imposed with regionalization constraints to account for the varying relationships between predictors and SIF in space and time. We then apply the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique to correct the offset between (SIF) over bar (GOME2_005) and (SIF) over bar (SCIA_005) inherited from the original instrumental discrepancies to generate a harmonized SIF time series from 2002 to present ((SIF) over bar (005)). Finally, we quantify the uncertainty of (SIF) over bar (005). (SIF) over bar (005) is validated with 1) the original retrievals to ensure the spatial and temporal variabilities are preserved, 2) airborne SIF derived from the Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS, R-2 = 0.73), and 3) ground-based SIF measurements at a subalpine coniferous forest (R-2 = 0.91). The SIFyield derived from (SIF) over bar (005) has high seasonal consistency with the ground measurements (R-2 = 0.93), suggesting that the harmonized product (SIF) over bar (005) carries physiological information beyond the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Additionally, (SIF) over bar (005) has a good capability for large-scale stress monitoring as demonstrated with several major historical drought and heatwave events. The framework developed in this study sets the stage for future development of even more advanced SIF products from all SIP-capable satellite platforms once issues related to inter-sensor calibration are resolved and SIF physiology is better understood.

The 3.4 mu m absorption in Titan's stratosphere: Contribution of ethane, propane, butane and complex hydrogenated organics	ICARUS			English	Article						Planets and satellites; Individual; Titan - planets and satellites; General - solar system; General	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; DIFFUSE INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; COUPLING PHOTOCHEMISTRY; HAZE FORMATION; WATER-VAPOR; ATMOSPHERE; CONSTRAINTS; EVOLUTION; PHOTOPRODUCTION; TEMPERATURES	The complex organic chemistry harbored by the atmosphere of Titan has been investigated in depth by Cassini observations. Among them, a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument throughout the 13 years of Cassini revealed a strong absorption centered at similar to 3.4 mu m. Several molecules present in Titan's atmosphere generate spectral features in that wavelength region, but their individual contributions are difficult to disentangle. In this work, we quantify the contribution of the various molecular species to the 3.4 pm band using a radiative transfer model. Ethane and propane are significant components of the band but they are insufficient to reproduce perfectly its shape. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and more complex polyaromatic hydrocarbons like Hydrogenated Amorphous Carbons (HACs) are the most plausible candidates because they are rich in C-H bonds. PAHs signature have already been detected above similar to 900 km, and they are recognized as precursors of aerosol particles. High similarities between individual spectra impede the derivation of abundances.

For this reason, both the European Space Agency's JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Europa Clipper missions have ice penetrating radar sounders in their payloads. In addition to the ice-ocean interface and shallow water lenses, liquid water in the eutectic zone of Europa's ice shell could also be a target for radar sounding investigations. However, the wide range of possible configurations for eutectic-zone water bodies and the overlying ice make their absolute echo strength difficult to predict. To address this challenge, we employ a suite of simple water configurations and scattering models to bound the eutectic detectability in terms of its effective reflectivity. We find that, for each configuration, a range of physically plausible eutectic parameters exist that could produce detectable echoes, with effective reflectivity values greater than -50 dB at HF or VHF frequencies.

Star catalog position and proper motion corrections in asteroid astrometry II: The Gaia era	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Asteroids dynamics; Orbit determination; Astrometry; Near-Earth objects		Astrometric positions of moving objects in the Solar System have been measured using a variety of star catalogs in the past. Previous work has shown that systematic errors in star catalogs can affect the accuracy of astrometric observations. That, in turn, can influence the resulting orbit fits for minor planets. In order to quantify these systematic errors, we compare the positions and proper motion of stellar sources in the most utilized star catalogs to the second release of the Gaia star catalog. The accuracy of Gaia astrometry allows us to unambiguously identify local biases and derive a scheme that can be used to correct past astrometric observations of solar system objects. Here, we provide substantially improved debiasing tables for 26 astrometric catalogs that were extensively used in minor planet astrometry. Revised corrections near the galactic center eliminate artifacts that could be traced back to reference catalogs used in previous debiasing schemes. Median differences in stellar positions between catalogs now tend to be on the order of several tens of milliarcseconds (mas) but can be as large as 175 mas. Median stellar proper motion corrections scatter around 0.3 mas/yr and range from 1 to 4 mas/yr for star catalogs with and without proper motion, respectively. The tables presented in this work contain a posteriori corrections meant to improve orbit fits based on optical observations that were measured against astrometric catalogs other than Gaia. However, astrometrists are strongly encouraged to make use of the most recent Gaia astrometric catalog when submitting new observations. Since previous debiasing schemes already reduced systematics in past observations to a large extent, corrections beyond the current work may not be needed in the foreseeable future.

In the inner Cassini Division, we identify outward-propagating density waves with wavenumber m = 1 located near 118,050 km (W118.05), 118,400 km (W118.40), and 118,530 km (W118.53). From Cassini ISS images taken at very low incidence angles we find evidence for vertical structure in these waves, which may be evidence for splashing of ring material in the crests of the waves. We propose that these waves are driven by nearby eccentric ringlets, probably the Strange (or R6) and Herschel ringlets. In the outer Cassini Division, we identify a wave structure near 120,200 km (W120.20), between the Laplace and Bessel gaps, as a conspicuous example of a standing wave in a planetary ring system. It appears to be the superposition of an outward-propagating m = 1 density wave, probably driven by the nearby Laplace ringlet, and its reflection at the inner edge of the Bessel gap.

An endogenic origin of cerean organics	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Ceres; impacts; survival of aliphatic organics	STARTING CONDITIONS; IMPACT; CRATERS; SURFACE; MATTER; DEFORMATION; METEORITE; MOON; ICE	Localized deposits of aliphatic organic-rich material have been found on the surface of dwarf planet Ceres, and based on mineralogical context, it has been suggested that these organics formed within Ceres (De Sanctis et al., 2017). However, no obvious source and exposure mechanism can be inferred from the geological settings of the organic-rich terrains. The alternative hypothesis is that the organics were delivered from an exogenic source via impact (Pieters et al., 2018). We numerically simulate the thermal degradation of aliphatic organics delivered to Ceres during hypervelocity impacts, as well as the thermal degradation and excavation of organics from the subsurface. Our models show that exogenic delivery of aliphatic organics is inefficient, as most of the spectral signature of the organic species would be thermally degraded and diluted by mixing with target material in the ejecta blanket of a given crater. Instead, our models suggest that the formation of Ernutet crater excavated a subsurface reservoir of aliphatic organics from a depth of 3-6 km, bringing it close to the surface, where it could be subsequently exhumed by small craters and landslides, compatible with observations.

Recently, convolutional LSTM has been shown to be successful in solving various complex spatiotemporal based problems. In this research, we propose a novel precipitation nowcasting architecture 'Convcast' to predict various short-term precipitation events using satellite data. We train Convcast with ten consecutive NASA's IMERG precipitation data sets each at intervals of 30 minutes. We use the trained neural network model to predict the eleventh precipitation data of the corresponding ten precipitation sequence. Subsequently, the predicted precipitation data are used iteratively for precipitation nowcasting of up to 150 minutes lead time. Convcast achieves an overall accuracy of 0.93 with an RMSE of 0.805 mm/h for 30 minutes lead time, and an overall accuracy of 0.87 with an RMSE of 1.389 mm/h for 150 minutes lead time. Experiments on the test dataset demonstrate that Convcast consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art optical flow based nowcasting algorithms. Results from this research can be used for nowcasting of weather events from satellite data as well as for future on-board processing of precipitation data.

Demonstration of a Thermally Coupled Row-Column SNSPD Imaging Array	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						single-photon detector; nanowires; SNSPD; superconducting devices; detector arrays	SINGLE; DETECTORS	While single-pixel superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and timing performance from the UV to near-IR, scaling these devices to large imaging arrays remains challenging. Here, we propose a new SNSPD multiplexing system using thermal coupling and detection correlations between two photosensitive layers of an array. Using this architecture with the channels of one layer oriented in rows and the second layer in columns, we demonstrate imaging capability in 16-pixel arrays with accurate spot tracking at the few-photon level. We also explore the performance trade-offs of orienting the top layer nanowires parallel and perpendicular to the bottom layer. The thermally coupled row-column scheme is readily able to scale to the kilopixel size with existing readout systems and, when combined with other multiplexing architectures, has the potential to enable megapixel scale SNSPD imaging arrays.

We present a global inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation that spatially allocates the national emissions reported to the UNFCCC (Scarpelli et al., 2019). Our inventory is at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolution and resolves the subsectors of oil and gas exploitation, from upstream to downstream, and the different emission processes (leak-age, venting, flaring). Global emissions for 2016 are 41.5 Tg a(-1) for oil, 24.4 Tg a(-1) for gas, and 31.3 Tg a(-1) for coal. An array of databases is used to spatially allocate national emissions to infrastructure, including wells, pipelines, oil refineries, gas processing plants, gas compressor stations, gas storage facilities, and coal mines. Gridded error estimates are provided in normal and lognormal forms based on emission factor uncertainties from the IPCC. Our inventory shows large differences with the EDGAR v4.3.2 global gridded inventory both at the national scale and in finer-scale spatial allocation. It shows good agreement with the gridded version of the United Kingdom's National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI). There are significant errors on the 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees grid associated with the location and magnitude of large point sources, but these are smoothed out when averaging the inventory over a coarser grid. Use of our inventory as prior estimate in inverse analyses of atmospheric methane observations allows investigation of individual subsector contributions and can serve policy needs by evaluating the national emissions totals reported to the UNFCCC. Gridded data sets can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HH4EUM (Scarpelli et al., 2019).

The (Re)appearance of NGC 925 ULX-3, a New Transient ULX	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							X-RAY SOURCE; PULSAR; DISCOVERY; COUNTERPART; ABSORPTION; PULSATIONS; ACCRETION; STARS	We report the discovery of a third ULX in NGC 925 (ULX-3), detected in 2017 November by Chandra at a luminosity of L-X = (7.8 +/- 0.8) x 10(39) erg s(-1). Examination of archival data for NGC 925 reveals that ULX-3 was detected by Swift at a similarly high luminosity in 2011, as well as by XMM-Newton in 2017 January at a much lower luminosity of L-X = (3.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(38) erg s(-1). With an additional Chandra nondetection in 2005, this object demonstrates a high dynamic range of flux of factor greater than or similar to 26. In its high-luminosity detections, ULX-3 exhibits a hard power-law spectrum with G = 1.6 +/- 0.1, whereas the XMM-Newton detection is slightly softer, with Gamma = 1.8(-0.1)(+0.2), and is also well-fitted with a broadened disk model. The long-term light curve is sparsely covered and could be consistent either with the propeller effect or with a large-amplitude superorbital period, both of which are seen in ULXs, in particular those with neutron star accretors. Further systematic monitoring of ULX-3 will allow us to determine the mechanism by which ULX-3 undergoes its extreme variability and to better understand the accretion processes of ULXs.

Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of quiescent galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at z > 1. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers that otherwise would pass color selection, and over photometric template fitting, more strongly toward high redshift. Due to the similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions, t-SNE outperforms template fitting in 63% of trials at redshifts where a large training sample already exists. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.

Fermi LAT Collaboration; VERITAS Collaboration	A Decade of Multiwavelength Observations of the TeV Blazar 1ES 1215+303: Extreme Shift of the Synchrotron Peak Frequency and Long-term Optical-Gamma-Ray Flux Increase	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Active galaxies; Jets; Gamma-rays; Blazars; BL Lacertae objects	LIGHT CURVES; VARIABILITY; RADIO; POLARIZATION; CONNECTION; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; ROBOPOL; SAMPLE; NOISE	Blazars are known for their variability on a wide range of timescales at all wavelengths. Most studies of TeV gamma-ray blazars focus on short timescales, especially during flares. With a decade of observations from the Fermi-LAT and VERITAS, we present an extensive study of the long-term multiwavelength radio-to-gamma-ray flux-density variability, with the addition of a couple of short-time radio-structure and optical polarization observations of the blazar 1ES 1215+303 (z = 0.130), with a focus on its gamma-ray emission from 100 MeV to 30 TeV. Multiple strong GeV gamma-ray flares, a long-term increase in the gamma-ray and optical flux baseline, and a linear correlation between these two bands are observed over the ten-year period. Typical HBL behaviors are identified in the radio morphology and broadband spectrum of the source. Three stationary features in the innermost jet are resolved by Very Long Baseline Array at 43.1, 22.2, and 15.3 GHz. We employ a two-component synchrotron self-Compton model to describe different flux states of the source, including the epoch during which an extreme shift in energy of the synchrotron peak frequency from infrared to soft X-rays is observed.

This behavior is considerably distinct from the widely used lithium-ion batteries, necessitating new mechanistic insights to fully understand the electrochemical phenomena. Testing at low-temperature conditions presents a unique opportunity to glean new insights into the chemistry in kinetically constrained environments. Under such conditions, despite the low freezing point and favorable ionic conductivity of the glyme-based electrolyte, Li-S batteries exhibit counter-intuitively poor performance. Here, we show that beyond just existing in single-molecule conformations, lithium polysulfides tend to cluster and aggregate in solution, particularly at low-temperature conditions, which subsequently constrains the kinetics of electro-chemical conversion. Energetics and coordination implications of this behavior are extended toward a new framework for understanding the solution coordination dynamics of dissolved lithium species. Based on this framework, a favorable strongly bound lithium salt is introduced in the Li-S electrolyte to disrupt polysulfide clustered networks, enabling substantially enhanced low-temperature electrochemical performance. More broadly, this mechanistic insight heightens our understanding of polysulfide chemistry irrespective of temperature, confirming the link between the solution conformation of active material and electrochemical behavior.

The Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA) and bRing are both photometric ground-based instruments with multiple stations that rely on interline charge-coupled devices with wide-field lenses to monitor bright stars in the local sky for variability. MASCARA has already discovered several planets in the northern sky, which are among the brightest known transiting hot Jupiter systems. Aims. In this paper, we aim to characterize a transiting planetary candidate in the southern skies found in the combined MASCARA and bRing data sets of HD 85628, an A7V star of V = 8.2 mag at a distance 172 pc, to establish its planetary nature. Methods. The candidate was originally detected in data obtained jointly with the MASCARA and bRing instruments using a Box Least-Square search for transit events. Further photometry was taken by the 0.7 m Chilean-Hungarian Automated Telescope (CHAT), and radial velocity measurements with the Fiber Dual Echelle Optical Spectrograph on the European Southern Observatory 1.0 m Telescope. High-resolution spectra during a transit were taken with the CTIO high-resolution spectrometer (CHIRON) on the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System 1.5 m telescope to target the Doppler shadow of the candidate. Results. We confirm the existence of a hot Jupiter transiting the bright A7V star HD 85628, which we co-designate as MASCARA-4b and bRing-1b. It is in an orbit of 2.824 days, with an estimated planet radius of 1.53(-0.04)(+0.07) R-Jup and an estimated planet mass of 3.1 +/- 0.9 M-Jup, putting it well within the planetary regime. The CHAT observations show a partial transit, reducing the probability that the transit was around a faint background star. The CHIRON observations show a clear Doppler shadow, implying that the transiting object is in a retrograde orbit with |lambda| = 244.9(-3.6)(+2.7)degrees. The planet orbits at a distance of 0.047 +/- 0.004 AU from the star and has a zero-albedo equilibrium temperature of 2100 +/- 100 K. In addition, we find that HD 85628 has a previously unreported stellar companion star in the Gaia DR2 data demonstrating common proper motion and parallax at 4.3 '' separation (projected separation similar to 740 AU), and with absolute magnitude consistent with being a K/M dwarf. Conclusions. MASCARA-4 b/bRing-1 b is the brightest transiting hot Jupiter known to date in a retrograde orbit. It further confirms that planets in near-polar and retrograde orbits are more common around early-type stars. Due to its high apparent brightness and short orbital period, the system is particularly well suited for further atmospheric characterization.

Detection of Cross-Correlation between Gravitational Lensing and gamma Rays	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							DARK ENERGY SURVEY	In recent years, many gamma-ray sources have been identified, yet the unresolved component hosts valuable information on the faintest emission. In order to extract it, a cross-correlation with gravitational tracers of matter in the Universe has been shown to be a promising tool. We report here the first identification of a cross-correlation signal between gamma rays and the distribution of mass in the Universe probed by weak gravitational lensing. We use data from the Dark Energy Survey Y1 weak lensing data and the Fermi Large Area Telescope 9-yr gamma-ray data, obtaining a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.3. The signal is mostly localized at small angular scales and high gamma-ray energies, with a hint of correlation at extended separation. Blazar emission is likely the origin of the small-scale effect. We investigate implications of the large-scale component in terms of astrophysical sources and particle dark matter emission.

Planar Self-similar Antennas for Broadband Millimeter-Wave Measurements	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Antennas; Kinetic inductance detector (KID); CMB; Polarization		Self-similar antennas offer extremely broadband functionality and easily scalable designs. Self-similar designs with a four-arm layout are also suited for dual polarization through excitations of opposing arms, although there has only been limited use of them for millimeter-wave detectors. These antennas have been used for measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which encompass a wide frequency range and are now actively focusing more on polarization anisotropies. We analyze multiple planar self-similar antenna designs with simulations in high-frequency structure simulator and ongoing physical testing. They all exhibit broadband operation between 130 and 230 GHz and can couple to both linear polarizations through the previously mentioned four-arm symmetry. Simulations include each antenna design coupled to an extended hemispherical, AR-coated lenslet. From these, a basic bowtie-like arm design produced minimal polarization wobble with moderate beam efficiency, while a hybrid trapezoidal design provided high beam efficiency with small polarization wobble. Current fabrication versions of each are being tested, coupled to multichroic microwave kinetic inductance detectors. These planar self-similar antennas, when implemented in CMB and other detectors, could improve observations while simultaneously simplifying fabrication and detector layout.

It is therefore critical to accurately represent this feature when assessing the future contribution of Greenland to sea level rise. At present, NEGIS is reproduced in ice sheet models by inferring basal conditions using observed surface velocities. This approach helps estimate conditions at the base of the ice sheet but cannot be used to estimate the evolution of basal drag in time, so it is not a good representation of the evolution of the ice sheet in future climate warming scenarios. NEGIS is suggested to be initiated by a geothermal heat flux anomaly close to the ice divide, left behind by the movement of Greenland over the Icelandic plume. However, the heat flux underneath the ice sheet is largely unknown, except for a few direct measurements from deep ice core drill sites. Using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), with ice dynamics coupled to a subglacial hydrology model, we investigate the possibility of initiating NEGIS by inserting heat flux anomalies with various locations and intensities. In our model experiment, a minimum heat flux value of 970 mW m(-2) located close to the East Greenland Ice-core Project (EGRIP) is required locally to reproduce the observed NEGIS velocities, giving basal melt rates consistent with previous estimates. The value cannot be attributed to geothermal heat flux alone and we suggest hydrothermal circulation as a potential explanation for the high local heat flux. By including high heat flux and the effect of water on sliding, we successfully reproduce the main characteristics of NEGIS in an ice sheet model without using data assimilation.

The in situ plasma density measurements are utilized to estimate the altitude-integrated electron number density or cometary ionospheric total electron content (TEC) of 67P based on the assumption of radially expanding plasma. The TEC is shown to increase with decreasing heliocentric distance (r(h)) of the comet, reaching a peak value of (133 +/- 84) x 10(9) cm(-2) averaged around perihelion (r(h) < 1.5 au). At large heliocentric distances (r(h) > 2.5 au), the TEC decreases by 2 orders of magnitude. For the same heliocentric distance, TEC values are found to be significantly larger during the post-perihelion periods compared to the pre-perihelion TEC values. This "ionospheric hysteresis effect" is more prominent in the southern hemisphere of the comet and at large heliocentric distances. A significant hemispheric asymmetry is observed during perihelion with approximately two times larger TEC values in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere. The asymmetry is reversed and stronger during post-perihelion (r(h) > 1.5 au) periods with approximately three times larger TEC values in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere. Hemispheric asymmetry was less prominent during the pre-perihelion intervals. The correlation of the cometary TEC with the incident solar ionizing fluxes is maximum around and slightly after perihelion (1.5 au < r(h) < 2 au), while it significantly decreases at larger heliocentric distances (r(h) > 2.5 au) where the photo-ionization contribution to the TEC variability decreases. The results are discussed based on cometary ionospheric production and loss processes.

J	Werner, F; Deneke, H				Werner, Frank; Deneke, Hartwig			Increasing the spatial resolution of cloud property retrievals from Meteosat SEVIRI by use of its high-resolution visible channel: evaluation of candidate approaches with MODIS observations	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SOLAR-RADIATION MEASUREMENTS; EFFECTIVE PARTICLE RADIUS; BOUNDARY-LAYER CLOUDS; OPTICAL-THICKNESS; INDEPENDENT PIXEL; DIURNAL CYCLE; STRATOCUMULUS; SATELLITE; VARIABILITY; DEPTH	This study presents and evaluates several candidate approaches for downscaling observations from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in order to increase the horizontal resolution of subsequent cloud optical thickness (tau) and effective droplet radius (r(eff)) retrievals from the native approximate to 3km x 3km spatial resolution of the narrowband channels to approximate to 1km x 1km. These methods make use of SEVIRI's coincident broadband high-resolution visible (HRV) channel. For four example cloud fields, the reliability of each downscaling algorithm is evaluated by means of collocated 1km x 1km MODIS radiances, which are reprojected to the horizontal grid of the HRV channel and serve as reference for the evaluation. By using these radiances, smoothed with the modulation transfer function of the native SEVIRI channels, as retrieval input, the accuracy at the SEVIRI standard resolution can be evaluated and an objective comparison of the accuracy of the different downscaling algorithms can be made. For the example scenes considered in this study, it is shown that neglecting high-frequency variations below the SEVIRI standard resolution results in significant random absolute deviations of the retrieved tau and reff of up to approximate to 14 and approximate to 6 mu m, respectively, as well as biases. By error propagation, this also negatively impacts the reliability of the subsequent calculation of liquid water path (W-L) and cloud droplet number concentration (N-D), which exhibit deviations of up to approximate to 89 gm(-2) and approximate to 177cm(-3), respectively. For tau, these deviations can be almost completely mitigated by the use of the HRV channel as a physical constraint and by applying most of the presented downscaling schemes. Uncertainties in retrieved r(eff) at the native SEVIRI resolution are smaller, and the improvements from downscaling the observations are less obvious than for tau. Nonetheless, the right choice of downscaling scheme yields noticeable improvements in the retrieved r(eff). Furthermore, the improved reliability in retrieved cloud products results in significantly reduced uncertainties in derived W-L and N-D. In particular, one downscaling approach provides clear improvements for all cloud products compared to those obtained from SEVIRI's standard resolution and is recommended for future downscaling endeavors. This work advances efforts to mitigate impacts of scale mismatches among channels of multiresolution instruments on cloud retrievals.

CMIP5 model selection for ISMIP6 ice sheet model forcing: Greenland and Antarctica	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; REGIONAL CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE BIASES; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; SHELF CAVITY; CIRCULATION; PROJECTIONS; MELTWATER; DRAINAGE	The ice sheet model intercomparison project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) effort brings together the ice sheet and climate modeling communities to gain understanding of the ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. ISMIP6 conducts stand-alone ice sheet experiments that use space- and time-varying forcing derived from atmosphere-ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) to reflect plausible trajectories for climate projections. The goal of this study is to recommend a subset of CMIP5 AOGCMs (three core and three targeted) to produce forcing for ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century. The selection is performed separately for Greenland and Antarctica. Model evaluation over the historical period focuses on variables used to generate ice sheet forcing. For stage (i), we combine metrics of atmosphere and surface ocean state (annual- and seasonal-mean variables over large spatial domains) with metrics of time-mean subsurface ocean temperature biases averaged over sectors of the continental shelf. For stage (ii), we maximize the diversity of climate projections among the best-performing models. Model selection is also constrained by technical limitations, such as availability of required data from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections. The selected top three CMIP5 climate models are CCSM4, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M for Antarctica and HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M for Greenland. This model selection was designed specifically for ISMIP6 but can be adapted for other applications.

Global measurements of ocean vector winds have been provided by scatterometers for decades, but a synoptic approach to measuring total vector surface currents has remained elusive. Doppler scatterometry is a coherent burst-scatterometry technique that builds on the long heritage of spinning pencil beam scatterometers to enable the wide-swath, simultaneous measurement of ocean surface vector winds and currents. To prove the measurement concept, NASA funded the DopplerScatt airborne Doppler scatterometer through the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) and Airborne Instrument Technology Transition (AITT) program. DopplerScatt has successfully shown that pencil beam Doppler scatterometry can be used to form wide swath measurements of ocean winds and currents, and has increased the technology readiness level of key instrument components, including: Ka-band pulsed radar hardware, optimized scatterometer burst-mode operation, calibration techniques, geophysical model functions, and processing algorithms. With the promise and progress shown by DopplerScatt, and the importance of air-sea interactions in mind, the National Academy's Decadal Survey has targeted simultaneous measurements of winds and currents from a Doppler scatterometer for an Earth Explorer class spaceborne mission. Besides DopplerScatt's place as a technology stepping stone towards a satellite mission, DopplerScatt provides scientifically important measurements of ocean currents and winds (400 m resolution) and their derivatives (1 km resolution) over a 25 km swath. These measurements are enabling studies of the submesoscales and air-sea interactions that were previously impossible, and are central to the upcoming NASA Earth Ventures Suborbital-3 Submesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE). This paper summarizes the development of DopplerScatt hardware, systems, calibration, and operations, and how advances in each relate to progress towards a spaceborne Doppler scatterometer mission.

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has been collecting Global Positioning System (GPS) signals as they reflect off the Earth's surface since August 2015. The L-band dual-polarization reflection measurements enable studies of the evolution of geophysical parameters during seasonal transitions. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of SMAP-reflectometry signals to agricultural crop growth related characteristics: crop type, vegetation water content (VWC), crop height, and vegetation opacity (VOP). The study presented here focuses on the United States "Corn Belt," where an extensive area is planted every year with mostly corn, soybean, and wheat. We explore the potential to generate regularly an alternate source of crop growth information independent of the data currently used in the soil moisture (SM) products developed with the SMAP mission. Our analysis explores the variability of the polarimetric ratio (PR), computed from the peak signals at V- and H-polarization, during the United States Corn Belt crop growing season in 2017. The approach facilitates the understanding of the evolution of the observed surfaces from bare soil to peak growth and the maturation of the crops until harvesting. We investigate the impact of SM on PR for low roughness scenes with low variability and considering each crop type independently. We analyze the sensitivity of PR to the selected crop height, VWC, VOP, and Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) reference datasets. Finally, we discuss a possible path towards a retrieval algorithm based on Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements that could be used in combination with passive SMAP soil moisture algorithms to correct simultaneously for the VWC and SM effects on the electromagnetic signals.

Demonstration of sub-3 ps temporal resolution with a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector	NATURE PHOTONICS			English	Article							QUANTUM TELEPORTATION; JITTER	Knowledge about detection latency provides a guideline to reduce the timing jitter of niobium nitride superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors. A timing jitter of 2.6 ps at visible wavelength and 4.3 ps at 1,550 nm is achieved. Improvements in temporal resolution of single-photon detectors enable increased data rates and transmission distances for both classical and quantum optical communication systems, higher spatial resolution in laser ranging, and observation of shorter-lived fluorophores in biomedical imaging. In recent years, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the most efficient time-resolving single-photon-counting detectors available in the near-infrared, but understanding of the fundamental limits of timing resolution in these devices has been limited due to a lack of investigations into the timescales involved in the detection process. We introduce an experimental technique to probe the detection latency in SNSPDs and show that the key to achieving low timing jitter is the use of materials with low latency. By using a specialized niobium nitride SNSPD we demonstrate that the system temporal resolution can be as good as 2.6 +/- 0.2 ps for visible wavelengths and 4.3 +/- 0.2 ps at 1,550 nm.

Long-distance QKD spanning regions such as the United Kingdom (UK) may employ a constellation of satellites. Small satellites, CubeSats in particular, in low Earth orbit are a relatively low-cost alternative to traditional, large platforms. They allow the deployment of a large number of spacecrafts, ensuring greater coverage and mitigating some of the risk associated with availability due to cloud cover. We present our mission analysis showing how a constellation comprising 15 low-cost 6U CubeSats can be used to form a secure communication backbone for ground-based and metropolitan networks across the UK. We have estimated the monthly key rates at 43 sites across the UK, incorporating local meteorological data, atmospheric channel modelling and orbital parameters.

Ensemble methods are largely preferred as they enable the estimation of error properties, but at the expense of computational load and generally with underestimations. These imperfect stochastic estimates motivate the use of correction methods, that is, error localization and inflation, although the physical justifications for their optimality are limited. The purpose of this study is to use one of the simplest forms of data assimilation when applied to river modeling and reveal the underlying mechanisms impacting its performance. Our framework based on assimilating daily averaged in situ discharge measurements to correct daily averaged runoff was tested over a 4-yr case study of two rivers in Texas. Results show that under optimal conditions of inflation and localization, discharge simulations are consistently improved such that the mean values of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency are enhanced from -11.32 to 0.55 at observed gauges and from -12.24 to -1.10 at validation gauges. Yet, parameters controlling the inflation and the localization have a large impact on the performance. Further investigations of these sensitivities showed that optimal inflation occurs when compensating exactly for discrepancies in the magnitude of errors while optimal localization matches the distance traveled during one assimilation window. These results may be applicable to more advanced data assimilation methods as well as for larger applications motivated by upcoming river-observing satellite missions, such as NASA's Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission.

This revolution in part is associated with the emergence of CubeSat platforms that have forced a de facto standardization on the volume and power into which sensors have to fit. The extent that small sensors can indeed provide similar or replacement capabilities compared to larger and more expensive counterparts has barely been demonstrated and any loss of capability of smaller systems weighed against the gains in costs and new potential capabilities offered by implementing them with a more distributed observing strategy also has not yet been embraced. This paper provides four examples of observations made with prototype miniaturized observing systems, including from CubeSats, that offer a glimpse of this emerging sensor revolution and a hint at future observing system design.

The ground-based observations yield the detection of finite-source effects, and the microlens parallaxes are derived from the joint analysis of ground-based observations and Spitzer observations. We find that the lens of OGLE-2017-BLG-1254 is a 0.60 +/- 0.03 M-circle dot star with D-LS = 0.53 +/- 0.11 kpc, where D-LS is the distance between the lens and the source. The second event, OGLE-2017-BLG-1161, is subject to the known satellite parallax degeneracy, and thus is either a 0.51(-0.10)(+0.12) M-circle dot star with D-LS = 0.40 +/- 0.12 kpc or a 0.38(-0.12)(+0.13) M-circle dot star with D-LS = 0.53 +/- 0.19 kpc. Both of the lenses are therefore isolated stars in the Galactic bulge. By comparing the mass and distance distributions of the eight published Spitzer finite-source events with the expectations from a Galactic model, we find that the Spitzer sample is in agreement with the probability of finite-source effects occurring in single-lens events.

Snowfall is measured by a combination of snow pillows, snow courses, and rain gauges. However, the paucity of locations of these measurements, particularly at high elevations, can introduce artifacts into precipitation estimates that are detrimental for hydrologic forecasting. To reduce errors, we need high-resolution, spatially complete measurements of precipitation. Remotely sensed snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE), with retrieval time scales that resolve storms, could help mitigate this problem in snow-dominated watersheds. Since 2013, National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) has measured snow depth in the Tuolumne basin of California's Sierra Nevada to advance streamflow forecasting through improved estimates of SWE. In early April 2015, two flights 6 days apart bracketed a single storm. The work herein documents a new use for ASO and presents a methodology to directly measure the spatial variability of frozen precipitation. In an end-to-end analysis, we also compare gauge-interpolated and dynamically downscaled estimates of precipitation for the given storm with that of the ASO change in SWE. The work shows that the extension of ASO operations to additional storms could benefit our understanding of mountain hydrometeorology by delivering observations that can truly evaluate the spatial distribution of snowfall for both statistical and numerical models. Plain Language Summary Precipitation, which includes rain, snow, sleet, and hail, recycles water from the atmosphere back to Earth's surface. The dynamic way in which the atmosphere and land interact generates highly variable precipitation rates, particularly in mountain landscapes. To quantify precipitation, we currently use a network of gauges at fixed locations, and to make these measurements more meaningful, we use statistics or models to "fill the blanks." However, because the "blanks" often incorporate mountain peaks and valleys, it is challenging, if not impossible, to discern the accuracy and precision of our models and understanding of the process. Consequently, we require new ways of measuring mountain precipitation. Unlike rain, snow remains roughly in place following snowfall, thereby preserving the distribution of precipitation. Airborne lidar can now measure these changes in depth after storms at high accuracy and precision. Here we present a methodology that uses this technological advancement to map the variability in precipitation during a snowstorm. Ultimately, these techniques, if extended to additional storms in various regions around the world, could help to evaluate precipitation in weather models by improving understanding of mountain precipitation.

In-flight Performance and Calibration of the LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) for the New Horizons Mission	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						instrumentation: detectors; space vehicles: instruments; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric		The LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) is a panchromatic (360-910 nm for the wavelengths where the responsivity falls to 10% of the peak value), narrow-angle (field of view =. 0 degrees. 29), high spatial resolution (pixel scale = 1 02) visible light imager used on NASA's New Horizons (NH) mission for both science observations and optical navigation. Calibration observations began several months after the New Horizons launch on 2006 January 19 and have been repeated approximately annually throughout the course of the mission, which is ongoing. This paper describes the in-flight LORRI calibration measurements, and the results derived from our analysis of the calibration data. LORRI has been remarkably stable over time with no detectable changes (at the similar to 1% level) in sensitivity or optical performance since launch. The point-spread function varies over the FOV but is well-characterized and stable, enabling accurate deconvolution to recover the highest possible spatial resolution during observations of resolved targets, especially when multiple, overlapping images are obtained. By employing 4 x 4 re-binning of the CCD pixels during read out, a special spacecraft tracking mode, exposure times of similar to 30 s, and co-addition of similar to 100 images, LORRI can detect unresolved targets down to V approximate to 22 with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of similar to 5. LORRI images have an instantaneous dynamic range of similar to 3500, which combined with exposure time control ranging from 0 ms to 64,967 ms in 1 ms steps supports high resolution, high sensitivity imaging of planetary targets spanning heliocentric distances from Jupiter to deep in the Kuiper Belt, enabling a wide variety of scientific investigations. We describe here how to transform LORRI images from raw (engineering) units into scientific (calibrated) units for both resolved and unresolved targets. Assuming that the wavelength variation of LORRI's sensitivity is accurately described by the ground-based calibration, we estimate that LORRI's absolute sensitivity is accurate to similar to 2% (1 sigma) for targets with solar-type spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The accuracy of the absolute calibration for targets with other SEDs should be comparably good when employing synthetic photometry techniques, which we do when deriving LORRI's photometry keywords. We also describe various instrumental artifacts that could affect the interpretation of LORRI images under some observing circumstances.	[Weaver, H. A.; Cheng, A. F.; Morgan, F.; Taylor, H.

Shear localization and its dependence on microstructural length scales in metallic glass composites	MATERIALIA			English	Article						Metallic glass; Shear bands; Nanoindentation; Shear localization; Composite	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MATRIX COMPOSITES; DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR; PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; POISSONS RATIO; SERRATED FLOW; BAND BEHAVIOR; TENSILE; NANOINDENTATION; NANOGLASSES	Extrinsic approaches for the pursuit of ductility in metallic glasses have involved the introduction of a ductile crystalline phase to inhibit the propagation of a dominant shear front through the amorphous matrix material. Using nanoindentation, we explore the role of crystalline inclusions in metallic glass matrix composites with a focus on the onset of shear banding in the amorphous matrix and the nature of shear band propagation using the propensity for localization and its dependence on indentation strain rate. When indentation length scales are favorable to distribute strain to both the crystalline dendrites and amorphous matrix, we reveal a reduction in the number of detectable displacement bursts and an accompanying decrease in the magnitude of individual depth excursions from shear banding. A decrease in the stress at the onset of shear banding is also correlated with shear band trajectories interacting with the amorphous-crystalline interfaces (ACIs). Our results thus demonstrate that ACIs reducing the activation barrier for shear banding combined with dendrites arresting propagating shear fronts act to enhance the nucleation rate and in turn, promote a more homogeneous plastic response.

The cascading transition begins with two processes: radiative and collision-induced electronic transitions (CIETs) involving two states (a'(1) Sigma(-)(u) and w(1)Delta(u) -> a(1)Pi(g)), which are followed by a cascade induced transition a(1)Pi(g)-> X-1 Sigma(+)(g) at the single-scattering pressures employed here. Direct excitation to the a-state produces a confined LBH spectral glow pattern around an electron beam. We have spatially resolved the electron-induced glow pattern from an electron beam colliding with N-2 at radial distances of 0-400 mm at three gas pressures. This imaging measurement is the first to isolate spectral measurements in the laboratory of single-scattering electron-impact-induced fluorescence from two LBH emission processes: direct excitation, which is strongest in emission near the electron beam axis; and cascading-induced, which is dominant far from the electron beam axis. The vibrational populations for vibrational levels from v' = 0-2 of the a (1)Pi(g) state are enhanced by radiative cascade and CIETs, and the emission cross sections of the LBH band system for direct and cascading-induced excitation are provided at 40, 50, 100, and 200 eV.

Energetic Particles and Acceleration Regions Over Jupiter's Polar Cap and Main Aurora: A Broad Overview	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							ELECTRON; MAGNETOSPHERE; WAVES; IONS	Previous Juno mission event studies revealed powerful electron and ion acceleration, to 100s of kiloelectron volts and higher, at low altitudes over Jupiter's main aurora and polar cap (PC; poleward of the main aurora). Here we examine 30-1200 keV JEDI-instrument particle data from the first 16 Juno orbits to determine how common, persistent, repeatable, and ordered these processes are. For the PC regions, we find (1) upward electron angle beams, sometimes extending to megaelectron volt energies, are persistently present in essentially all portions of the polar cap but are generated by two distinct and spatially separable processes. (2) Particle evidence for megavolt downward electrostatic potentials are observable for 80% of the polar cap crossings and over substantial fractions of the PC area. For the main aurora, with the orbit favoring the duskside, we find that (1) three distinct zones are observed that are generally arranged from lower to higher latitudes but sometimes mixed. They are designated here as the diffuse aurora (DifA), Zone-I (ZI(D)) showing primarily downward electron acceleration, and Zone-II (ZII(B)) showing bidirectional acceleration with the upward intensities often greater than downward intensities. (2) ZI(D) and ZII(B) sometimes (but not always) contain, respectively, downward electron inverted Vs and downward proton inverted Vs, (potentials up to 400 kV) but, otherwise, have broadband distributions. (3) Surprisingly, both ZI(D) and ZII(B) can generate equally powerful auroral emissions. It is suggested but demonstrated for intense portions of only one auroral crossing, that ZI(D) and ZII(B) are associated, respectively, with upward and downward electric currents. Plain Language Summary The science objectives of the Juno mission, with its spacecraft now orbiting Jupiter in a polar orbit, include understanding the space environments of Jupiter's polar regions and generation of Jupiter's uniquely powerful aurora. In Jupiter's polar cap regions (poleward of the main auroral oval encircling the northern and southern poles), we find here that (1) beams of electrons aligned with the upward magnetic field direction are ever-present with energies extended to the 100s to 1,000s of kilo electron volts and (2) downward magnetic field-aligned electrostatic potentials reaching greater than a million volts occur over broad regions for 80% of the polar cap crossings. For the main auroral oval, we find three distinct zones: designated here as diffuse aurora (DifA), Zone-I (ZI(D)) showing downward electron acceleration to 100s of kiloelectron volts, and Zone-II (ZII(B)) showing bidirectional acceleration with the upward intensities often greater than downward intensities. ZI(D) sometimes shows upward electrostatic potentials reaching 100s of kilovolts and is associated with upward magnetic field-aligned electric currents. ZII(B) sometimes shows downward electrostatic potentials reaching 100s of kilovolts and is associated with downward electric currents. Unexpectedly from Earth studies, ZI(D) and ZII(B) are just as likely to generate the most intense auroral emissions.	[Mauk, B. H.; Clark, G.; Haggerty, D. K.; Kollmann, P.; Paranicas, C.

MESSENGER Observations of Mercury's Nightside Magnetosphere Under Extreme Solar Wind Conditions: Reconnection-Generated Structures and Steady Convection	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; PLASMA SHEET; MAGNETOPAUSE STRUCTURE; GUIDE FIELD; X-LINE; SUBSTORMS; MAGNETOTAIL; FLUX; SIMULATIONS; TAIL	Mercury's nightside magnetosphere is investigated under the impact of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a high-speed stream (HSS) with MErcury Surface, Space ENviroment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) observations. The CME was shown to produce a low plasma.. (ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) magnetosheath, while the HSS creates a higher.. magnetosheath. Reconnection at the dayside magnetopause was found to be stronger during the CME than the HSS, but both were stronger than the average condition (Slavin et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JA020319). Here we show that the CME and HSS events produced large numbers of flux ropes and dipolarization fronts in the plasma sheet. The occurrence rates for the structures were approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than under average conditions with the rates during CME's being twice that of HSS's. The flux ropes appeared as quasiperiodic flux rope groups. Each group lasted approximately 1 min and had a few large flux ropes followed by several smaller flux ropes. The lobe magnetic flux accounted for around half of the Mercury's available magnetic flux with the flux during CME's being larger than that of HSS's. The CME produced a more dynamic nightside magnetosphere than the HSS. Further, for the CME event, the tail magnetic reconnection produced a distorted Hall magnetic field pattern and the X-line had a dawn-dusk extent of 20% of the tail width. No magnetic flux loading and unloading events were observed suggesting that, during these intense driving conditions, Mercury's magnetosphere responded with a type of quasi-steady convection as opposed to the tail flux loading-unloading events seen at Earth.

Identification and Description of a Silicic Volcaniclastic Layer in Gale Crater, Mars, Using Active Neutron Interrogation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							LABORATORYS DYNAMIC ALBEDO; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; DAN EXPERIMENT; EVOLUTION; ANCIENT; CALIBRATION; DIVERSITY; DEPOSITS; ORIGIN	The Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons instrument aboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, has been used to map a stratigraphically conformable layer of high-SiO2 material in Gale crater. Previous work has shown that this material contains tridymite, a high-temperature/low-pressure felsic mineral, interpreted to have a volcanic source rock. We describe several characteristics including orientation, extent, hydration, and geochemistry, consistent with a volcaniclastic material conformably deposited within a lacustrine mudstone succession. Relationships with widely dispersed alteration features and orbital detections of hydrated SiO2 suggest that this high-SiO2 layer extends at least 17 km laterally. Mineralogical abundances previously reported for this high-SiO2 material indicated that hydrous species were restricted to the amorphous (non-crystalline) fraction, which is dominated by SiO2. The low mean bulk hydration of this high-SiO2 layer (1.85 +/- 0.13 wt.% water-equivalent hydrogen) is consistent with silicic glass in addition to opal-A and opal-CT. Persistent volcanic glass and tridymite in addition to opal in an ancient sedimentary unit indicates that the conversion to more ordered forms of crystalline SiO2 has not proceeded to completion and that this material has had only limited exposure to water since it originally erupted, despite having been transported in a fluviolacustrine system. Our results, including the conformable nature, large areal extent, and presence of volcanic glass, indicate that this high-SiO2 material is derived from the product of evolved magma on Mars. This is the first identification of a silicic volcaniclastic layer on another planet and has important implications for magma evolution mechanisms on single-plate planets. Plain Language Summary Using the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons instrument aboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, we mapped a silica-rich layer throughout a small region in Gale crater known as Marias Pass. Previous work has shown that some rocks in Marias Pass contain minerals formed in explosive volcanic eruptions. We determined several key characteristics including orientation, extent, hydration, and elemental composition, which are consistent with material derived from a volcanic deposit. This layer is likely related to nearby silica-rich material deposited by groundwater along subsurface fractures, and geometric relationships to hydrated silica identified from orbit suggest that this high-silica layer extends over at least 17 km. Mineralogical data from previous work indicates the crystalline fraction is anhydrous. As such, we interpret the low hydration of this material, attributable to the amorphous (non-crystalline) fraction, as being consistent with a significant abundance of volcanic glass in addition to other hydrated phases. The presence of volcanic glass indicates that this material has had limited exposure to water since its formation, because glasses tend to preferentially weather. Our results show that this layer is parallel to surrounding rocks, covers a large area, and contains volcanic glass, indicating that it derived from an explosive volcanic product.

A Lacustrine Paleoenvironment Recorded at Vera Rubin Ridge, Gale Crater: Overview of the Sedimentology and Stratigraphy Observed by the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity Rover	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; PAHRUMP HILLS; EVOLUTION; ROCKS; MISSION; RATES; MAHLI; UNIT	For similar to 500 Martian solar days (sols), the Mars Science Laboratory team explored Vera Rubin ridge (VRR), a topographic feature on the northwest slope of Aeolis Mons. Here we review the sedimentary facies and stratigraphy observed during sols 1,800-2,300, covering more than 100 m of stratigraphic thickness. Curiosity's traverse includes two transects across the ridge, which enables investigation of lateral variability over a distance of similar to 300 m. Three informally named stratigraphic members of the Murray formation are described: Blunts Point, Pettegrove Point, and Jura, with the latter two exposed on VRR. The Blunts Point member, exposed just below the ridge, is characterized by a recessive, fine-grained facies that exhibits extensive planar lamination and is crosscut by abundant curvi-planar veins. The Pettegrove Point member is more resistant, fine-grained, thinly planar laminated, and contains a higher abundance of diagenetic concretions. Conformable above the Pettegrove Point member is the Jura member, which is also fine-grained and parallel stratified, but is marked by a distinct step in topography, which coincides with localized meter-scale inclined strata, a thinly and thickly laminated facies, and occasional crystal molds. All members record low-energy lacustrine deposition, consistent with prior observations of the Murray formation. Uncommon outcrops of low-angle stratification suggest possible subaqueous currents, and steeply inclined beds may be the result of slumping. Collectively, the rocks exposed at VRR provide additional evidence for a long-lived lacustrine environment (in excess of 106 years via comparison to terrestrial records of sedimentation), which extends our understanding of the duration of habitable conditions in Gale crater. Plain language summary The primary goal of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover mission is to explore and assess ancient habitable environments on Mars. This requires a detailed understanding of the environments recorded by sedimentary rocks exposed at the present-day surface in Gale crater. Here we review the types of sedimentary rocks exposed at a location known as Vera Rubin ridge. We find that the rocks at Vera Rubin ridge record an ancient lake environment and are a continuation of underlying lake deposits. Ancient lake deposits are highly desirable targets in the search for habitable environments, due to their ability to concentrate and preserve organic matter. This study significantly expands the duration of habitable conditions that can be confirmed through ground truth of sedimentary rocks and provides a framework for interpreting strata that lie ahead as Curiosity continues to explore Aeolis Mons.

Impact of Gravity Waves on the Middle Atmosphere of Mars: A Non-Orographic Gravity Wave Parameterization Based on Global Climate Modeling and MCS Observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							CONVECTIVE BOUNDARY-LAYER; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; DRAG; THERMOSPHERE; PARAMETRIZATION; SIMULATIONS; EQUINOX; DEPTH; TIDES	The impact of gravity waves (GW) on diurnal tides and the global circulation in the middle/upper atmosphere of Mars is investigated using a general circulation model (GCM). We have implemented a stochastic parameterization of non-orographic GW into the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) Mars GCM (LMD-MGCM) following an innovative approach. The source is assumed to be located above typical convective cells (similar to 250 Pa), and the effect of GWon the circulation and predicted thermal structure above 1 Pa (similar to 50 km) is analyzed. We focus on the comparison between model simulations and observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during Martian Year 29. MCS data provide the only systematic measurements of the Martian mesosphere up to 80 km to date. The primary effect of GWis to damp the thermal tides by reducing the diurnal oscillation of the meridional and zonal winds. The GWdrag reaches magnitudes of the order of 1 m/s/sol above 10-2 Pa in the northern hemisphere winter solstice and produces major changes in the zonal wind field (from tens to hundreds of m/s), while the impact on the temperature field is relatively moderate (10-20 K). It suggests that GW-induced alteration of the meridional flow is the main responsible for the simulated temperature variation. The results also show that with the GWscheme included, the maximum day-night temperature difference due to the diurnal tide is around 10 K, and the peak of the tide is shifted toward lower altitudes, in better agreement with MCS observations.

High Thermal Inertia Zones on Ceres From Dawn Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							ASTEROIDS; SUBMILLIMETER; TEMPERATURES; STABILITY; VESTA; MOON	Thermal inertia is a key information to quantify the physical status of a planetary surface. We derive the thermal inertia of the surface of Ceres using spatially resolved data from the Dawn mission. For each location, this quantity can be constrained by comparing theoretical and observed diurnal temperature profiles from retrieved temperatures. We calculated Ceres's surface theoretical temperatures with a thermophysical model that provides temperature as a function of thermal conductivity and roughness, and we determined the values of those parameters for which the best fit with the observed data is obtained. Our results suggest that the area of crater Haulani displays thermal inertia values (up to 130-140 J.m(-2).s(-1/2).K-1) substantially higher than the very low to low values (from 1-15 to 50-60 J.m(-2).s(-1/2).K-1) derived for the overall surface of Ceres. The results are more ambiguous for the bright faculae located in the floor of crater Occator. Plain Language Summary We have calculated Ceres's surface temperatures and we have compared them with the observations. We have used new high-resolution data provided by the Dawn/National Aeronautics and Space Administration mission, which was launched in 2007 with the aim of studying two of the largest bodies of the Main Belt: Vesta and Ceres. Our results suggest that the surface is made of fine-grained material, according to previous analysis made by other authors by using other independent data and methods. We have also studied two particular areas of Ceres that shows peculiar properties (albedo and/or chemical/physical structure).	[Rognini, E.; Capria, M. T.; Tosi, F.; De Sanctis, M.

Particle Ejection Contributions to the Rotational Acceleration and Orbit Evolution of Asteroid (101955) Bennu	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							YARKOVSKY; DYNAMICS	This paper explores the implications of the observed Bennu particle ejection events for that asteroid's spin rate and orbit evolution, which could complicate interpretation of the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) and Yarkovsky effects on this body's spin rate and orbital evolution. Based on current estimates of particle ejection rates, we find that the overall contribution to Bennu's spin and orbital drift is small or negligible as compared to the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. However, if there is a large unseen component of smaller mass ejections or a strong directionality in the ejection events, it could constitute a significant contribution that could mask the overall YORP effect. This means that the YORP effect may be stronger than currently assumed. The analysis is generalized so that the particle ejection effect can be assessed for other bodies that may be subject to similar mass loss events. Further, our model can be modified to address different potential mechanisms of particle ejection, which are a topic of ongoing study. Plain Language Summary The near-Earth asteroid Bennu has been observed to be ejecting particles of rock from its surface. The possible effect of these particle ejections on the asteroid's spin rate and orbit is studied using numerical modeling. We show that the effect is likely minimal, although for certain ejection geometries, their effect on the spin rate could be more important. The loss of mass caused by the particle ejections would likely limit the asteroid's rotational acceleration, suggesting that the acceleration effect on this body may be larger than assumed. We consider how different mechanisms of ejection could be modeled using our approach.	[Scheeres, D. J.; McMahon, J. W.; Brack, D. N.; French, A.

Arctic Snow Depth and Sea Ice Thickness From ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 Freeboards: A First Examination	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						Arctic Ocean; CryoSat-2; ICESat-2; sea ice; snow depth; thickness	AIRBORNE LASER; GPS DATA; RADAR; RETRIEVAL; MODEL; OCEAN; BAND	We present a first examination of Arctic sea ice snow depth estimates from differencing satellite lidar (ICESat-2) and radar (CryoSat-2) freeboards. These estimates cover the period between 14 October 2018 and the end of April 2019. Snow depth is related to freeboard differences by the refractive index/bulk density of the snow layer-the only free parameter in the approach. Area-averaged snow depth ranges from 9 cm (on first-year ice: 5 cm, multiyear ice: 14 cm) in late October to 19 cm (first-year ice: 17 cm, multiyear ice: 27 cm) in April; on average, this snow is thinner over FYI. Spatial patterns and gradients of snow depth estimates compare well with reconstructions using snowfall from ERA-Interim and ERA5, although snowfall from ERA5 is systematically higher. For all months, the results suggest that similar to 50% of the total freeboard is comprised of snow. Retrievals are within a few centimeters of snow depth data acquired by Operation IceBridge in April 2019. Sources of uncertainties associated with this freeboard-differencing approach are discussed. Further, sea ice thicknesses calculated using the retrieved snow depth and a modified climatology are contrasted. Comparatively, the snow depth and calculated ice thickness using a modified climatology are higher by similar to 5 cm and 0.33 m, although these differences are not uniform throughout the season. Snow accumulation was slower between October and December but increased between December and January, unlike the modified climatology, which exhibited a monotonic accumulation for all months. Future opportunities for assessment and improvement of these estimates are discussed. Plain Language Summary The snow layer atop Arctic sea ice is an important component of the climate system. In winter, the insulating effects of snow slow the rate of ice growth. In spring, the onset of ice surface melt is delayed until the highly reflective snow layer disappears. During summer, meltwater from snow collects in depressions to form melt ponds, which enhances the absorption of solar radiation leading to more rapid surface warming. Presently, there are no routine measurements of snow depth suitable for assessing the impact of climate changes on the precipitation and accumulation of snow on sea ice. Our current understanding of snow depth is limited and has been based on field measurements conducted in the middle of last century and from airborne surveys conducted over the last decade. In this paper, we combine the measurements from two altimetry missions (ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2) to calculate snow depth over the entire Arctic Ocean. ICESat-2 (a lidar) and CryoSat-2 (a radar) measure the heights to the top and bottom of the snow layer, respectively. Differencing the two heights provides an estimate of the thickness of the snow layer. This paper describes this novel approach and an assessment of the snow depth estimates.

The HWT provides a forum for collaboration to improve products ahead of widespread operational deployment. We found that the utilization of the NOAA-Unique Combined Atmospheric Processing System (NUCAPS) soundings was improved when the product developer and forecaster directly communicated to overcome misunderstandings and to refine user requirements. Here we share our adaptive strategy for (1) assessing when and where NUCAPS soundings improved operational forecasts by using real, convective case studies and (2) working to increase NUCAPS utilization by improving existing products through direct, face-to-face interaction. Our goal is to discuss the lessons we learned and to share both our successes and challenges working with the weather forecasting community in designing, refining, and promoting novel products. We foresee that our experience in the NUCAPS product development life cycle may be relevant to other communities who can then build on these strategies to transition their products from research to operations (and operations back to research) within the satellite meteorological community.

Validation of ASTER Emissivity Retrieval Using the Mako Airborne TIR Imaging Spectrometer at the Algodones Dune Field in Southern California, USA	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						ASTER; Mako; TES algorithm; temperature; emissivity; validation; Algodones	SPACEBORNE THERMAL EMISSION; REFLECTION RADIOMETER ASTER; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; STANDARD PRODUCTS; TEMPERATURE; SEPARATION; DESERT; MODEL; MODIS	Validation of emissivity (epsilon) retrievals from spaceborne thermal infrared (TIR) sensors typically requires spatial extrapolations over several orders of magnitude for a comparison between centimeter-scale laboratory epsilon measurements and the common decameter and lower resolution of spaceborne TIR data. In the case of NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) temperature and epsilon separation algorithm (TES), this extrapolation becomes especially challenging because TES was originally designed for the geologic surface of Earth, which is typically heterogeneous even at centimeter and decameter scales. Here, we used the airborne TIR hyperspectral Mako sensor with its 2.2 m/pixel resolution, to bridge this scaling issue and robustly link between ASTER TES 90 m/pixel emissivity retrievals and laboratory epsilon measurements from the Algodones dune field in southern California, USA. The experimental setup included: (i) Laboratory XRD, grain size, and TIR spectral measurements; (ii) radiosonde launches at the time of the two Mako overpasses for atmospheric corrections; (iii) ground-based thermal measurements for calibration, and (iv) analyses of ASTER day and night epsilon retrievals from 21 different acquisitions. We show that while cavity radiation leads to a 2% to 4% decrease in the effective emissivity contrast of fully resolved scene elements (e.g., slipface slopes and interdune flats), spectral variability of the site when imaged at 90 m/pixel is below 1%, because at this scale the dune field becomes an effectively homogeneous mixture of the different dune elements. We also found that adsorption of atmospheric moisture to grain surfaces during the predawn hours increased the effective epsilon of the dune surface by up to 0.04. The accuracy of ASTER's daytime emissivity retrievals using each of the three available atmospheric correction protocols was better than 0.01 and within the target performance of ASTER's standard emissivity product. Nighttime emissivity retrievals had lower precision (<0.03) likely due to residual atmospheric effects. The water vapor scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction protocol was required to obtain accurate (<0.01) nighttime ASTER emissivity retrievals.

HB is covered by ice and snow in winter, which completely melts in summer. For about six months each year, satellite remote sensing of sea surface salinity (SSS) is possible over open water. SSS links freshwater contributions from river discharge, sea ice melt/freeze, and surface precipitation/evaporation. Given the strategic importance of HB, SSS has great potential in monitoring the HB freshwater cycle and studying its relationship with climate change. However, SSS retrieved in polar regions (poleward of 50 degrees) from currently operational space-based L-band microwave instruments has large uncertainty (similar to 1 psu) mainly due to sensitivity degradation in cold water (<5 degrees C) and sea ice contamination. This study analyzes SSS from NASA Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity(SMOS) missions in the context of HB freshwater contents. We found that the main source of the year-to-year SSS variability is sea ice melting, in particular, the onset time and places of ice melt in the first couple of months of open water season. The freshwater contribution from surface forcing P-E is smaller in magnitude comparing with sea ice contribution but lasts on longer time scale through the whole open water season. River discharge is comparable with P-E in magnitude but peaks before ice melt. The spatial and temporal variations of freshwater contents largely exceed the remote sensed SSS uncertainty. This fact justifies the use of remote sensed SSS for monitoring the HB freshwater cycle.

Seismic Structure of the Antarctic Upper Mantle Imaged with Adjoint Tomography	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							MARIE-BYRD-LAND; DRONNING MAUD LAND; SPECTRAL-ELEMENT SIMULATIONS; WAVE-FORM TOMOGRAPHY; RAPID BEDROCK UPLIFT; WEST ANTARCTICA; ICE-SHEET; EAST ANTARCTICA; RIFT SYSTEM; RAYLEIGH-WAVE	The upper mantle and transition zone beneath Antarctica and the surrounding oceans are among the poorest-imaged regions of the Earth's interior. Over the last 15 years, several large broadband regional seismic arrays have been deployed, as have new permanent seismic stations. Using data from 297 Antarctic and 26 additional seismic stations south of similar to 40 degrees S, we image the seismic structure of the upper mantle and transition zone using adjoint tomography. Over the course of 20 iterations, we utilize phase observations from three-component seismograms containing P, S, Rayleigh, and Love waves, including reflections and overtones, generated by 270 earthquakes that occurred from 2001-2003 and 2007-2016. The new continental-scale seismic model (ANT-20) possesses regional-scale resolution south of 60 degrees S. In East Antarctica, thinner continental lithosphere is found beneath areas of Dronning Maud Land and Enderby-Kemp Land. A continuous slow wave speed anomaly extends from the Balleny Islands through the western Ross Embayment and delineates areas of Cenozoic extension and volcanism that span both oceanic and continental regions. Slow wave speed anomalies are also imaged beneath Marie Byrd Land and along the Amundsen Sea Coast, extending to the Antarctic Peninsula. These anomalies are confined to the upper 200-250 km of the mantle, except in the vicinity of Marie Byrd Land where they extend into the transition zone and possibly deeper. Finally, slow wave speeds along the Amundsen Sea Coast link to deeper anomalies offshore, suggesting a possible connection with deeper mantle processes.	[Lloyd, A. J.; Wiens, D.

J	Hauk, M; Wiese, DN				Hauk, M.; Wiese, D. N.			New Methods for Linking Science Objectives to Remote Sensing Observations: A Concept Study Using Single - and Dual-Pair Satellite Gravimetry Architectures	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							GRAVITY RECOVERY; RESOLUTION; MISSION; MODEL	In this manuscript, we present a new analysis tool, called space-time-accuracy grid (STAG) analysis, to simultaneously assess the performance of an observing system architecture across space and time. Such an analysis tool is useful to directly link science objectives (typically expressed via a targeted spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy) to the expected performance of the observing system architecture. As a proof of concept, we apply STAG analysis to analyze three potential future observing systems for mass change in the Earth system: a single pair of polar orbiting satellites (heritage Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On), two polar pairs of satellites, and a polar pair of satellites coupled with an inclined (70 degrees) pair of satellites. Here, we demonstrate the use of STAG analysis to quantify the relative performance of each architecture across space (200-1,800 km) and time (1-30 days), offering a significantly more comprehensive assessment of performance than previous studies. Results show that the polar pair coupled with the inclined pair reduces errors (after state-of-the-art post-processing for each architecture is accounted for) relative to the single pair of satellites by 40-60% in medium spatial scales (500-1,200 km), with the greatest benefit being for longer solution (monthly) timespans. Overall, the results from this case study highlight the importance of increasing the isotropy of the observable over simply increasing the sampling frequency. Some demonstrated benefits of STAG analysis include the ability to incorporate state-of-the-art post-processing methods into the analysis and also tailor the analysis to specific geographic regions to address targeted scientific objectives.

J	Sutterley, TC; Velicogna, I; Hsu, CW				Sutterley, Tyler C.; Velicogna, Isabella; Hsu, Chia-Wei			Self-Consistent Ice Mass Balance and Regional Sea Level From Time-Variable Gravity	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; RECONCILED ESTIMATE; GRACE MEASUREMENTS; ANTARCTICA; SHEET; GREENLAND; MODEL; EARTH; VARIABILITY; ACCELERATION	Measurements of time-variable gravity from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the GRACE Follow-on (GRACE-FO) missions are an invaluable tool for monitoring changes in the mass of the Earth's glaciated regions. We improve upon estimates of glacier and ice sheet mass balance from time-variable gravity by including instantaneous spatiotemporal variations in sea level. Here, a least squares mascon technique is combined with solutions to the sea level equation to iteratively correct the GRACE/GRACE-FO data for the induced sea level response on a monthly basis. We find that variations in regional sea level affect ice sheet mass balance estimates in Greenland by approximately 4% and in Antarctic by approximately 5%. Since 2002, the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass at an average rate of 263 +/- 23 Gt/yr, and the Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass at average rates between 90 +/- 52 and 122 +/- 53 Gt/yr depending on the rate of glacial isostatic adjustment. The mass losses from both ice sheets represent an increase of 15.6 +/- 2.0 mm to global mean sea levels since 2002.

The main objective is to image and characterize a Near-Earth asteroid. The spacecraft packages a full deep space mission into the volume of a 6U CubeSat. To enable long-term sustained propulsion to the target, a solar sail is utilized as the main propulsion system. The spacecraft bus is single string, with compact avionics. Guidance and control performance meets science requirements with margin, but limited power impacts the amount of science data that can be returned, an aspect that is in part mitigated by the introduction of novel on-board data analysis software. Following in the recent footsteps of the Mars Cube One (MarCO) mission, the first deep space CubeSat demonstration, which included the infusion of the Iris radio; the NEA Scout will continue to blaze the trail for small CubeSats for interplanetary science and reconnaissance missions. This article will provide an overview of the mission, flight system design, and unique features needed for science and propulsion.

It is being jointly developed by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and the University of Tokyo, and will be launched by NASA's Space Launch System Exploration Mission-1. The spacecraft will fly to a libration orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 point (EML2) and will demonstrate low-energy trajectory-control techniques within the Sun-Earth-Moon region for the first time by a nano-class spacecraft. EQUULEUS also carries three scientific observation missions: imaging of Earth's plasmasphere by extreme ultraviolet wavelength, lunar impact flash observation on the far side of the moon, and micrometeoroid flux measurements in the cis-lunar region. While all these missions have their own scientific objectives, they will also contribute to future human activity and/or infrastructure development in the cis-lunar region. Most parts of the spacecraft system use commercial off-the-shelf components, or are designed based on the experiences of various past space missions, with the exception of the newly developed water resistojet propulsion system. EQUULEUS uses X-band frequency for deep space telecommunication. Japanese deep space antennas (64-m and 34-m) will be nominally used for spacecraft operation, and support from the deep space network of JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is also being planned, especially for the initial phase of operation. The spacecraft will fly to EML2 in less than one year, and will remain there for scientific observations until shortly before the depletion of the onboard propellant, when the spacecraft will leave the orbit for space-debris compliance.

The mission builds upon a decade of lunar science, which has revealed both regional and more localized enrichments of water ice near the lunar poles. Localized enrichments are primarily within permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) and craters throughout the South Pole. The spatial extent of these regions is often below the resolution of previous neutron instruments that have flown on lunar missions. The neutron leakage spectrum from planetary surfaces is primarily sensitive to hydrogen abundance in the top meter of regolith, however, for neutron spectrometers with omnidirectional sensitivity, the spatial resolution is limited by the spacecraft orbital altitude above the surface. A low altitude measurement from a distance on the same scale of the PSRs could spatially isolate and constrain the hydrogen enrichments both within and around within those regions. A small spacecraft mission is ideally suited to acquire the low-altitude measurements required to localize hydrogen enrichments using neutron spectroscopy at the lunar South Pole. LunaH-Map will use a solid iodine ion propulsion system, X-Band radio communications through the NASA Deep Space Network, star tracker, Command & Data Handling System, and EPS systems from Blue Canyon Technologies, solar arrays from MMA Designs, LLC, mission design and navigation by KinetX. Spacecraft systems design, integration, qualification, test, and mission operations are performed by Arizona State University, AZ Space Technologies and Qwaltec.

LSST Dark Energy Sci Collaboration	Tomographic galaxy clustering with the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam first year public data release	JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						cosmological parameters from LSS; power spectrum; redshift surveys	HALO OCCUPATION DISTRIBUTION; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTIONS; POWER SPECTRUM; MODEL; CONSTRAINTS; CALIBRATION; COSMOLOGY; ERRORS; LIMITS; SDSS	We analyze the clustering of galaxies in the first public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. Despite the relatively small footprints of the observed fields, the data are an excellent proxy for the very deep photometric datasets that will be acquired by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, and are therefore an ideal test bed for the analysis methods being implemented by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration. We select a magnitude limited sample with i < 24.5 and analyze it in four tomographic redshift bins covering the range 0.15 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 1.5. We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the two-point clustering of this sample, including all auto- and cross-correlations between bins. We demonstrate the use of map-level deprojection methods to account for non-physical fluctuations in the galaxy number density caused by observational systematics. Through a halo occupation distribution analysis, we place constraints on the characteristic halo masses of this sample as a function of redshift, finding a good fit up to scales k(max) = 1Mpc(-1), including both auto- and cross-correlations. Our results show monotonically decreasing average halo masses with increasing redshift, which can be interpreted in terms of the drop-out of red galaxies at high redshifts for a flux-limited sample, consistent with previous analyses. In terms of photometric redshift systematics, we show that additional care is needed in order to marginalize over uncertainties in the redshift distribution in galaxy clustering, even for samples of this small size, and that these uncertainties can be significantly constrained by including cross-bin correlations. We are able to make a similar to 3 sigma detection of the effects of lensing magnification in the HSC data. Our results are stable to variations in the amplitude of density fluctuations sigma(8) and the cold dark matter abundance Omega(c) and we find constraints that agree well with measurements from Planck and low-redshift probes. Finally, we use our analysis pipeline to study the clustering of galaxies as a function of limiting flux, and provide a simple fitting function for the linear galaxy bias for magnitude limited samples as a function of limiting magnitude and redshift.

Carbon Flux Variability From a Relatively Simple Ecosystem Model With Assimilated Data Is Consistent With Terrestrial Biosphere Model Estimates	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						carbon cycle; data assimilation; carbon modeling	GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; DATA FUSION; LEAF-AREA; CYCLE; SYSTEM; CMIP5; PROJECTIONS; FEEDBACKS; CO2; UNCERTAINTIES	Modeling the net carbon balance is challenging due to the knowledge gaps in the variability and processes controlling gross carbon fluxes. Terrestrial carbon cycle modeling is susceptible to several sources of bias, including meteorological uncertainty, model structural uncertainty, and model parametric uncertainty. To determine the impact of these uncertainties, we compare three model-derived representations of the global terrestrial carbon balance across 1997-2009: (1) observation-constrained model-data fusion (CARBon Data Model FraMEwork, CARDAMOM), (2) the reanalysis-driven Trends in Net Land-Atmosphere Carbon Exchange (TRENDY) land biosphere model ensemble, and (3) the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) Earth System Model ensemble. We consider the spread in carbon cycle simulations attributable primarily to parametric uncertainty (CARDAMOM), structural uncertainty (TRENDY), and combined structural and simulated meteorological uncertainty (CMIP5). We find that the spread across the CARDAMOM ensemble long-term mean-produced by parameter uncertainty-is larger than the spread of TRENDY and CMIP5 for net biosphere exchange (NBE) but similar for gross primary productivity (GPP). The carbon flux dynamics of CARDAMOM compares to models in TRENDY as well as models in TRENDY compare to each other in many regions for NBE seasonal (nine of 12), NBE interannual (11 of 12), and GPP seasonal variability (7 of 12), although not for GPP interannual variability (2 of 12). The simple model structure of CARDAMOM and systematic assimilation of observations is sufficient to produce carbon dynamics within the range of more complex models. These results are encouraging for the use of model-data fusion products with empirically estimated uncertainty for global carbon cycle studies. Plain Language Summary There is uncertainty in where carbon is going into or leaving the land biosphere on a net basis. Models are used to investigate this movement of carbon, but it is unclear how different approaches compare: using a complex model for which the best parameter sets are difficult to determine or using a simpler model for which it is easier to find the right parameters sets that best match observations. This paper compares collections of relatively complex models with a different approach that systematically combines remote sensing observations with a simpler model. Comparisons across mean values, seasonal variations, and interannual variations of photosynthesis and carbon movement show that the simple model-constrained by observations-is able to recreate most dynamics but also shows a broader range of possibilities than the collections of more complex models. The results suggest that more attention needs to be paid to parameter uncertainty in model settings, not just what processes they include. Including this uncertainty creates a larger spread of carbon cycle outcomes for the present and possibly for the future.

By utilizing an engineered diffuser and custom guiding software, we mitigate time-correlated telluric and instrumental noise sources in these observations. We achieve an infrared photometric precision comparable to or better than that of space-based observatories such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, and detect transits with greater than 3 sigma significance for all planets. For Kepler-177c (J = 13.9), our measurement uncertainties are only 1.2 times the photon noise limit and 1.9 times better than the predicted photometric precision for Spitzer IRAC photometry of this same target. We find that a single transit observation obtained 4-5 yr after the end of the original Kepler mission can reduce dynamical mass uncertainties by as much as a factor of 3 for these systems. Additionally, we combine our new observations of KOI-1783.01 with information from the literature to confirm the planetary nature of this system. We discuss the implications of our new mass and radius constraints in the context of known exoplanets with low incident fluxes, and we note that Kepler-177c may be a more massive analog to the currently known super-puffs given its core mass (3.8 +/- 0.9 M-circle plus) and large gas-to-core ratio (2.8 +/- 0.7). Our demonstrated infrared photometric performance opens up new avenues for ground-based observations of transiting exoplanets previously thought to be restricted to space-based investigation.

Possible Effects of Greenhouse Gases to Ozone Profiles and DNA Active UV-B Irradiance at Ground Level	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						ozone; UV-B irradiance; halogens; greenhouse gases; effects	VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; DECLINE; TRENDS	In this paper, we compare model calculations of ozone profiles and their variability for the period 1998 to 2016 with satellite and lidar profiles at five ground-based stations. Under the investigation is the temporal impact of the stratospheric halogen reduction (chemical processes) and increase in greenhouse gases (i.e., global warming) on stratospheric ozone changes. Attention is given to the effect of greenhouse gases on ultraviolet-B radiation at ground level. Our chemistry transport and chemistry climate models (Oslo CTM3 and EMAC CCM) indicate that (a) the effect of halogen reduction is maximized in ozone recovery at 1-7 hPa and observed at all lidar stations; and (b) significant impact of greenhouse gases on stratospheric ozone recovery is predicted after the year 2050. Our study indicates that solar ultraviolet-B irradiance that produces DNA damage would increase after the year 2050 by +1.3% per decade. Such change in the model is driven by a significant decrease in cloud cover due to the evolution of greenhouse gases in the future and an insignificant trend in total ozone. If our estimates prove to be true, then it is likely that the process of climate change will overwhelm the effect of ozone recovery on UV-B irradiance in midlatitudes.

Applying Tipping Point Theory to Remote Sensing Science to Improve Early Warning Drought Signals for Food Security	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						drought; early warning; food security; remote sensing; tipping points	CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION MODELS; SOIL-MOISTURE; SYSTEMS; FAMINE; ECOSYSTEMS; RAINFALL; GRACE; VULNERABILITY; REQUIREMENTS	Famines have long been associated with drought. With the severity of droughts growing in association with climate change, there is increasing pressure to do a better job predicting famines and delivering international aid to avert human suffering and civil instability. We examine recent advances in remote sensing technology, focusing on the latency, historical availability and spatial and temporal scales of the data these satellites provide. Because of their global coverage, seven variables derived from satellite observations emerge as especially pertinent to drought and famine: precipitation (TRMM/GPM), groundwater (GRACE/GRACE-FO), snow (MODIS), soil moisture (SMOS, SMAP, Sentinel-1), evapotranspiration (MODIS, ECOSTRESS), vegetation health (Landsat, AVHRR, MODIS, SPOT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (OCO-2). We discuss tipping point theory as a possible framework for taking advantage of long time series of these satellite data where they exist in order to enhance the effectiveness of existing famine early warning systems.

Kent			High-contrast Demonstration of an Apodized Vortex Coronagraph	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							EXTRASOLAR; MASK	High-contrast imaging is the primary path to the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets around solar-type stars; a cleverly designed internal coronagraph suppresses the light from the star, revealing the elusive circumstellar companions. However, future large-aperture telescopes (>4 m in diameter) will likely have segmented primary mirrors, which cause additional diffraction of unwanted stellar light. Here we present the first high-contrast laboratory demonstration of an apodized vortex coronagraph, in which an apodizer is placed upstream of a vortex focal plane mask to improve its performance with a segmented aperture. The gray-scale apodization is numerically optimized to yield a better sensitivity to faint companions assuming an aperture shape similar to the LUVOIR-B concept. Using wavefront sensing and control over a one-sided dark hole, we achieve a raw contrast of 2.x.10(-8) in monochromatic light at 775.nm, and a raw contrast of 4.x.10(-8) in a 10% bandwidth. These results open the path to a new family of coronagraph designs, optimally suited for next-generation segmented space telescopes.

The Detectability and Constraints of Biosignature Gases in the Near- and Mid-infrared from Transit Transmission Spectroscopy	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							LIFE; OXYGEN; SEARCH; EARTH; SKY	The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to revolutionize our understanding of Jovian worlds over the coming decade. However, as we push toward characterizing cooler, smaller, terrestrial-like planets, dedicated nextgeneration facilities will be required to tease out the small spectral signatures indicative of biological activity. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of determining atmospheric properties, from near-to -mid-infrared transmission spectra, of transiting temperate terrestrial M -dwarf companions. Specifically, we utilize atmospheric retrievals to explore the trade space between spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and signal-to-noise on our ability to both detect molecular species and constrain their abundances. We find that increasing spectral resolution beyond R = 100 for near-infrared wavelengths, shorter than 5 itm, proves to reduce the degeneracy between spectral features of different molecules and thus greatly benefits the abundance constraints. However, this benefit is greatly diminished beyond 5 pm as any overlap between broad features in the mid -infrared does not deconvolve with higher resolutions. Additionally, our findings revealed that the inclusion of features beyond 11 pm did not meaningfully improve the detection significance or the abundance constraints results. We conclude that an instrument with continuous wavelength coverage from 2 to 11 pm, spectral resolution of R <^> 50-300, and a 25 m2 collecting area, would be capable of detecting H20, CO2, CH4, 03, and N20 in the atmosphere of an Earth -analog transiting a M dwarf (magK = 8.0) within 50 transits, and obtain better than an order-of-magnitude constraint on each of their abundances.

Apart from the spiral feature, our observations could not detect any companion candidates. We traced the spiral feature from the r2-scaled High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIA0) polarimetric intensity image and the fitted result is used for forward modeling to reproduce the ADI-reduced NJRC2 image. We estimated the original surface brightness after throughput correction in the L' band to be-126 mJy arcsec-2 at most. We suggest that the grain temperature of the spiral may be heated up to-200 K in order to explain both of the H- and L'-band results. The H-band emission at the location of the spiral originates from the scattering from the disk surface while both scattering and thermal emission may contribute to the L'-band emission. If the central star is only the light source of scattered light, the spiral emission at the L' band should be thermal emission. If an inner disk also acts as the light source, the scattered light and the thermal emission may equally contribute to the L'-band spiral structure.

In the Calphad methodology these representations are usually based on physical models. Reasonable behavior of the thermodynamic properties of phases extrapolated far outside their stable ranges is necessary in order to avoid that they become stable just because these properties extrapolate badly. This paper proposes a method to prevent crystalline solid phases in multi-component systems to become stable again when extrapolated to temperatures far above their melting temperature.

The Central Amazon Biomass Sink Under Current and Future Atmospheric CO2: Predictions From Big-Leaf and Demographic Vegetation Models	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article						biomass storage; plant mortality; Brazil; carbon allocation; plant growth; climate change	NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; COMMUNITY LAND MODEL; ELEVATED CO2; CARBON SINK; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; NUTRIENT COMPETITION; CLIMATE FEEDBACKS; GLOBAL PATTERNS; NITROGEN	There is large uncertainty whether Amazon forests will remain a carbon sink as atmospheric CO2 increases. Hence, we simulated an old-growth tropical forest using six versions of four terrestrial models differing in scale of vegetation structure and representation of biogeochemical (BGC) cycling, all driven with CO2 forcing from the preindustrial period to 2100. The models were benchmarked against tree inventory and eddy covariance data from a Brazilian site for present-day predictions. All models predicted positive vegetation growth that outpaced mortality, leading to continual increases in present-day biomass accumulation. Notably, the two vegetation demographic models (VDMs) (ED2 and ELM-FATES) always predicted positive stem diameter growth in all size classes. The field data, however, indicated that a quarter of canopy trees didn't grow over the 15-year period, and while high interannual variation existed, biomass change was near neutral. With a doubling of CO2, three of the four models predicted an appreciable biomass sink (0.77 to 1.24 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). ELMv1-ECA, the only model used here that includes phosphorus constraints, predicted the lowest biomass sink relative to initial biomass stocks (+21%), lower than the other BGC model, CLM5 (+48%). Models projections differed primarily through variations in nutrient constraints, then carbon allocation, initial biomass, and density-dependent mortality. The VDM's performance was similar or better than the BGC models run in carbon-only mode, suggesting that nutrient competition in VDMs will improve predictions. We demonstrate that VDMs are comparable to nondemographic (i.e., "big-leaf") models but also include finer scale demography and competition that can be evaluated against field observations.

J	Siegelman, L				Siegelman, Lia			Energetic Submesoscale Dynamics in the Ocean Interior	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article						Ageostrophic circulations; Eddies; Frontogenesis; frontolysis; Mesoscale processes; Ocean dynamics; Potential vorticity	INTERNAL GRAVITY-WAVES; COHERENT VORTICES; PART I; MESOSCALE; MODEL; PARAMETERIZATION; DISSIPATION; VARIABILITY; TRANSITION; TRANSPORT	Submesoscale ocean processes, characterized by order-1 Rossby and Richardson numbers, are currently thought to be mainly confined to the ocean surface mixed layer, whereas the ocean interior is commonly assumed to be in quasigeostrophic equilibrium. Here, a realistic numerical simulation in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, with a 1/48 degrees horizontal resolution and tidal forcing, is used to demonstrate that the ocean interior departs from the quasigeostrophic regime down to depths of 900 m, that is, well below the mixed layer. Results highlight that, contrary to the classical paradigm, the ocean interior is strongly ageostrophic, with a pronounced cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry and a dominance of frontogenesis over frontolysis. Numerous vortices and filaments, from the surface down to 900 m, are characterized by large Rossby and low Richardson numbers, strong lateral gradients of buoyancy, and vigorous ageostrophic frontogenesis. These deep submesoscales fronts are only weakly affected by internal gravity waves and drive intense upward vertical heat fluxes, consistent with recent observations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Gulf Stream. As such, deep submesoscale fronts are an efficient pathway for the transport of heat from the ocean interior to the surface, suggesting the presence of an intensified oceanic restratification at depth.

Below-surface water mediates the response of African forests to reduced rainfall	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						GPP; SIF; groundwater; soil moisture	INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; CO2 GROWTH-RATE; SEMIARID ECOSYSTEMS; SOIL-MOISTURE; TROPICAL FORESTS; CARBON DYNAMICS; EL-NINO; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY	Terrestrial ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest land-atmosphere carbon flux and the primary mechanism of photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric CO2 into plant biomass. Anomalous rainfall events have been shown to have a great impact on the global carbon cycle. However, less is known about the impact of these events on GPP, especially in Africa, where in situ observations are sparse. Here, we use a suite of satellite and other geospatial data to examine the responses of major ecosystems in Africa to anomalous rainfall events from 2003 to 2017. Our results reveal that higher-than-average groundwater storage in tropical ecosystems offsets the rainfall deficit during the dry years. While the inter-annual variations in GPP in semi-arid ecosystems are controlled by near surface soil water, deeper soil moisture and groundwater control the inter-annual variability of the GPP in dense tropical forests. Our study highlights the critical role of groundwater in buffering rainfall shortages and continued availability of near-surface water to plants through dry spells.

High-priority science questions identified at the Mars Workshop on Amazonian and Present-Day Climate	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Amazonian; Climate; Present-day; Polar	POLAR LAYERED DEPOSITS; RECENT ICE AGES; MARTIAN POLAR; SPECIAL-ISSUE; GROUND ICE; NEEDED OBSERVATIONS; HIRISE OBSERVATIONS; ORBITER CAMERA; DORSA ARGENTEA; KEY QUESTIONS	The Mars Workshop on Amazonian and Present-Day Climate was held in June 2018. In this paper, we describe the context and motivations for the Workshop and summarize the proceedings. In particular, we identify 37 high-priority Mars Amazonian and present-day climate questions that arose from presentations and discussion at the workshop, which we group under Key Questions on (I) interpreting the record in the Polar Layered Deposits, (2) identifying and characterizing off-polar climate records (such as large subsurface mid-latitude ice deposits and signs of aqueous alteration), (3) the global budget of dust/sand, salts, and ice, and (4) the global movement of these materials. These 37 questions pertain to processes in the atmosphere, surface, and subsurface active in the present and past, as well as the record they leave of the historical climate. As many of the processes of interest are interconnected, the questions we present are often intertwined; some questions are identified as being of highest-priority because of their larger scientific value and/or that addressing it would contribute important information towards answering many other questions. Related to the high-priority questions, we identify key measurements in the areas of PLD formation and evolution, surface change/interactions, state of global reservoirs, and environmental (surface/atmospheric) conditions. Our objective is for these lists of high-priority questions and measurements to contribute towards discussion of future Mars scientific exploration, and to record the state of Mars Amazonian climate knowledge as of the time of our workshop.

Tony			Automated GNSS and Teleseismic Earthquake Inversion (AutoQuake Inversion) for Tsunami Early Warning: Retrospective and Real-Time Results	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS			English	Article						GNSS data; teleseismic data; Slab2; focal mechanism forecast; fast joint source inversion; tsunami early warning	NEAR-FIELD; COSEISMIC DISPLACEMENTS; TOHOKU EARTHQUAKE; RUPTURE PROCESS; PACIFIC COAST; GPS DATA; CHILE; DEFORMATION; ILLAPEL; SYSTEM	Rapid finite fault source determination is critical for reliable and robust tsunami early warnings. Near-field Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations have shown value to constrain the source inversion, but real-time GNSS stations are sparse along most of the active faults. Here we propose an automatic earthquake finite source inversion (AutoQuake Inversion) algorithm jointly using near-field (epicentral distance <1000 km) GNSS data and mid-range (epicentral distance from 30 degrees to 45 degrees) teleseismic P displacement waveforms. Neither the near-field GNSS nor the mid-range teleseismic data clip or saturate during large earthquakes, while the fast-traveling P-waves are still essential to constrain the source in regions where very few or no GNSS stations are available. Real-time determination of the fault geometry remains to be the main challenge for rapid finite source inversion. We adopt a strategy to use the pre-defined geometry Slab2 for earthquakes within it or to forecast a focal mechanism based on near-by historical events for earthquakes without Slab2 prior. The algorithm has been implemented successfully in the prototype of JPL's GPS-Aided Tsunami Early-Detection system and tested for many real events recently. This article provides the framework of the algorithm, documents the retrospective and real-time results, and discusses remaining challenges for future improvements.

One such unexplored region is the luminosity gap between giant pulses (from pulsars) and cosmologically located fast radio bursts (FRBs). The Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) is a search for such transients out to 7 Mpc. STARE2 has a field of view of 3.6 steradians and is sensitive to 1 millisecond transients above similar to 300 kJy. With a two-station system we have detected and localized a solar burst, demonstrating that the pilot system is capable of detecting short duration radio transients. We found no convincing non-solar transients with duration between 65 mu s and 34 ms in 200 days of observing, limiting with 95% confidence the all-sky rate of transients above similar to 300 kJy to <40 sky(-1) yr(-1). If the luminosity function of FRBs could be extrapolated down to 300 kJy for a distance of 10 kpc, then one would expect the rate to be similar to 2 sky(-1) yr(-1).

Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Science Case and Survey Design	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						radio continuum: general; surveys	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; FARADAY DEPTH STRUCTURE; RADIO-LOUD; STAR-FORMATION; BROAD-BAND; ROTATION MEASURE; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; INFRARED SURVEY; HOST GALAXIES; HIGH-REDSHIFT	The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is a synoptic, all-sky radio sky survey with a unique combination of high angular resolution (25), sensitivity (a 1 sigma goal of 70 mu Jy/beam in the coadded data), full linear Stokes polarimetry, time domain coverage, and wide bandwidth (2-4 GHz). The first observations began in 2017 September, and observing for the survey will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hr of time on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA (decl. > -40 degrees), a total of 33 885 deg(2). The data will be taken in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources. The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an "on the fly" interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and observational strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey observations.	[Lacy, M.; Kent, B. R.; Murphy, E. J.; Beasley, A.

The simple modulation and demodulation architecture of the proposed DS/SS radar enables wideband and high-resolution radar measurements without the need for broadband A/D and D/A conversion, making the delay-correlating approach attractive for low-power radar applications. The demonstrated radar system operates at 205 GHz and offers a 3.0 cm range resolution while consuming 614 mW of dc power.

Although increases in glacier flow(4-6) and surface melting(7-9) have been driven by oceanic(10-12) and atmospheric(13,14) warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet's mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet's volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 +/- 66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 +/- 342 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 +/- 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,964 +/- 565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 +/- 541 billion tonnes (49.7 per cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 +/- 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 +/- 25 billion tonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 +/- 30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions(15) and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbr AE(16). Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario(17), which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate.

A global geomorphologic map of Saturn's moon Titan	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							CASSINI RADAR; SURFACE; TRANSPORT	Titan has an active methane-based hydrologic cycle(1) that has shaped a complex geologic landscape(2), making its surface one of most geologically diverse in the Solar System. Despite the differences in materials, temperatures and gravity fields between Earth and Titan, many of their surface features are similar and can be interpreted as products of the same geologic processes(3). However, Titan's thick and hazy atmosphere has hindered the identification of its geologic features at visible wavelengths and the study of its surface composition(4). Here we identify and map the major geological units on Titan's surface using radar and infrared data from the Cassini orbiter spacecraft. Correlations between datasets enabled us to produce a global map even where datasets were incomplete. The spatial and superposition relations between major geological units reveals the likely temporal evolution of the landscape and provides insight into the interacting processes driving its evolution. We extract the relative dating of the various geological units by observing their spatial superposition in order to get information on the temporal evolution of the landscape. The dunes and lakes are relatively young, whereas the hummocky or mountainous terrains are the oldest on Titan. Our results also show that Titan's surface is dominated by sedimentary or depositional processes with a clear latitudinal variation, with dunes at the equator, plains at mid-latitudes and labyrinth terrains and lakes at the poles.

J	Jani, K; Shoemaker, D; Cutler, C				Jani, Karan; Shoemaker, Deirdre; Cutler, Curt			Detectability of intermediate-mass black holes in multiband gravitational wave astronomy	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article								The direct measurement of gravitational waves is a powerful tool for surveying the population of black holes across the universe. While LIGO has detected black holes as heavy as similar to 50 M-circle dot (ref.(1)), there is not yet unambiguous evidence of black holes in the intermediate mass range of 10(2-5) M-circle dot. Recent electromagnetic observations have hinted towards the existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs)(2-4); however, their masses remain poorly constrained. Here we argue that multi-band observations by space- and ground-based gravitational wave detectors(5,6) will be able to survey a broad population of IMBHs at cosmological distances. By utilizing general relativistic simulations of merging black holes(7) and state-of-the-art gravitational waveform models(8), we classify three distinct populations of binaries with IMBHs and discuss what can be observed about each. Multiband observations involving the upgraded LIGO detector(9) and the proposed space-mission LISA(10) would detect the inspiral, merger and ring-down of IMBH binaries out to redshift approximate to 2, pushing out to redshift approximate to 5 if next-generation ground-based detectors(11,12) are operational at the same time. To facilitate studies of multiband IMBH sources, we provide analytic relations for the maximum redshift of multiband detectability, as a function of black hole mass, for various detector combinations. Our study paves the way for future work on what can be learned from IMBH observations in the era of multiband gravitational wave astronomy.

The Super-pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope (SUPERBIT) is a diffraction-limited, wide-field, 0.5 m telescope capable of exploiting these observing conditions in order to provide exquisite imaging throughout the near-infrared to near-ultraviolet. It utilizes a robust active stabilization system that has consistently demonstrated a 48 mas 1 sigma sky-fixed pointing stability over multiple 1 h observations at float. This is achieved by actively tracking compound pendulations via a three-axis gimballed platform, which provides sky-fixed telescope stability at < 500 mas and corrects for field rotation, while employing high-bandwidth tip/tilt optics to remove residual disturbances across the science imaging focal plane. SUPERBIT's performance during the 2019 commissioning flight benefited from a customized high-fidelity science-capable telescope designed with an exceptional thermo- and opto-mechanical stability as well as a tightly constrained static and dynamic coupling between high-rate sensors and telescope optics. At the currently demonstrated level of flight performance, SUPERBIT capabilities now surpass the science requirements for a wide variety of experiments in cosmology, astrophysics, and stellar dynamics.

The First Ultracompact Roche Lobe-Filling Hot Subdwarf Binary	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							PERIOD VARIABLE-STARS; NON-LTE ANALYSIS; O-TYPE SUBDWARF; X-RAY-EMISSION; WHITE-DWARFS; OMEGAWHITE SURVEY; B-STARS; LOW-RESOLUTION; KPD 0422+5421; MASS-TRANSFER	We report the discovery of the first short-period binary in which a hot subdwarf star (sdOB) filled its Roche lobe and started mass transfer to its companion. The object was discovered as part of a dedicated high-cadence survey of the Galactic plane named the Zwicky Transient Facility and exhibits a period of P = 39.3401(1) minutes, making it the most compact hot subdwarf binary currently known. Spectroscopic observations are consistent with an intermediate He-sdOB star with an effective temperature of = 42,400 300 K and a surface gravity of M-sdOB = 0.337 0.015 M-WD = 0.545 0.020 . Theoretical binary modeling indicates the hot subdwarf formed during a common envelope phase when a 2.5-2.8 star lost its envelope when crossing the Hertzsprung gap. To match its current and masses, we estimate a post-common envelope period of 150 minutes and find that the sdOB star is currently undergoing hydrogen shell burning. We estimate that the hot subdwarf will become a white dwarf with a thick helium layer of 0.1, merge with its carbon/oxygen white dwarf companion after 17 Myr, and presumably explode as a thermonuclear supernova or form an R CrB star.

We combine self-consistent, numerical models of Jupiter's equilibrium tidal response with observed Doppler shifts from the Juno gravity science experiment to test the sensitivity of the spacecraft to tides raised by the Galilean satellites and the Sun. The concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method finds the equilibrium shape and gravity field of a rotating, liquid planet with the tide raised by a satellite, expanded in Love numbers (k(nm)). We present improvements to the CMS theory that eliminate an unphysical center-of-mass offset and study in detail the convergence behavior of the CMS approach. We demonstrate that the dependence of k(nm) with orbital distance is important when considering the combined tidal response for Jupiter. Conversely, the details of the interior structure have a negligible influence on k(nm) for models that match the zonal harmonics J(2), J(4), and J(6), already measured to high precision by Juno. As the mission continues, improved coverage of Jupiter's gravity field at different phases of Io's orbit is expected to yield an observed value for the degree-two Love number (k(22)) and potentially select higher-degree k(nm). We present a test of the sensitivity of the Juno Doppler signal to the calculated k(nm), which suggests the detectability of k(33), k(42), and k(31), in addition to k(22). A mismatch of a robust Juno observation with the remarkably small range in calculated Io equilibrium, k(22) = 0.58976 0.0001, would indicate a heretofore uncharacterized dynamic contribution to the tides.

The SPTpol Extended Cluster Survey	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							LENSING MASS CALIBRATION; MICROWAVE BACKGROUND-RADIATION; SZ-SELECTED CLUSTERS; GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY; SCALING RELATIONS; RELATIVISTIC CORRECTIONS; COMPLETE SAMPLE; RICH CLUSTERS; SKY SURVEYS	We describe the observations and resultant galaxy cluster catalog from the 2770 deg(2) SPTpol Extended Cluster Survey (SPT-ECS). Clusters are identified via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect and confirmed with a combination of archival and targeted follow-up data, making particular use of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). With incomplete follow-up we have confirmed as clusters 244 of 266 candidates at a detection significance xi >= 5 and an additional 204 systems at 4 xi z = 0.49, and we have identified 44 strong gravitational lenses in the sample thus far. Radio data are used to characterize contamination to the SZ signal; the median contamination for confirmed clusters is predicted to be similar to 1% of the SZ signal at the xi > 4 threshold, and 10% of their measured SZ flux. We associate SZ-selected clusters, from both SPT-ECS and the SPT-SZ survey, with clusters from the DES redMaPPer sample, and we find an offset distribution between the SZ center and central galaxy in general agreement with previous work, though with a larger fraction of clusters with significant offsets. Adopting a fixed Planck-like cosmology, we measure the optical richness-SZ mass ( <CDATA <i ) relation and find it to be 28% shallower than that from a weak-lensing analysis of the DES data-a difference significant at the 4 sigma level-with the relations intersecting at lambda = 60. The SPT-ECS cluster sample will be particularly useful for studying the evolution of massive clusters and, in combination with DES lensing observations and the SPT-SZ cluster sample, will be an important component of future cosmological analyses.

State-of-the-art SSA parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) are typically modeled using near-surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitation. However, these have non-trivial biases in CMIP3 and CMIP5 GCMs over the tropical Pacific Ocean that can contribute to biases in the simulated SSA. This study investigates the impacts of falling ice radiative effects on the biases of the aforementioned modeled parameters and the resulting modeled SSA biases. We compare the CMIP5 modeled SSA against satellite observations from MISR and MODIS using a pair of sensitivity experiments with falling ice radiative effects on and off in the CESM1-CAM5 model. The results show that when falling ice radiative effects are not taken into account, models have weaker surface wind speeds, warmer SSTs, excessive precipitation, and diluted sea surface salinity (SSS) over the Pacific trade-wind regions, leading to underestimated SSA. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the inclusion of falling ice radiative effects leads to improvements in the modeled near-surface wind speeds, SSTs, and precipitation through cloud-precipitation-radiation-circulation coupling, which results in more representative patterns of SSA and reduces the SSA biases by similar to 10% to 15% relative to the satellite observations. Models including falling ice radiative effects in CMIP5 produce smaller biases in SSA than those without falling ice radiative effects. We suggest that one of the causes of these biases is likely the failure to account for falling ice radiative effects, and these biases in turn affect the direct and indirect effects of SSA in the GCMs.	[Chen, Yi-Chun; Lee, Wei-Liang] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan; [Li, Jui-Lin F.; Diner, David J.; Garay, Michael J.; Jiang, Jonathan H.; Kalashnikova, Olga, V] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Wang, Yi-Hui] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Yu, Jia-Yuh] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taoyuan, Taiwan	Chen, YC (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.	yichunchen@gate.sinica.edu.tw	Yu, Jia-Yuh/Y-9365-2019; Garay, Michael/AAJ-8106-2020	Garay, Michael/0000-0002-1374-5074	RCEC, Academia Sinica; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contracts of ATMOS COMP 2013 [NNH12ZDA001N-CCST]; NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) programs	YCC acknowledge RCEC, Academia Sinica for supporting this study.

Colour and tropospheric cloud structure of Jupiter from MUSE/VLT: Retrieving a universal chromophore	ICARUS			English	Article						Atmospheres; Composition; Jovian planets; Jupiter; Atmosphere; Radiative transfer	AMMONIA NH3 ABSORPTION; GREAT RED SPOT; GALILEO PROBE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; JOVIAN ATMOSPHERE; VISIBLE SPECTRUM; TEMPERATURES; METHANE; ICE	Recent work by Sromovsky et al. (2017) suggested that all red colour in Jupiter's atmosphere could be explained by a single colour-carrying compound, a so-called 'universal chromophore'. We tested this hypothesis on ground-based spectroscopic observations in the visible and near-infrared (480-930 nm) from the VLT/MUSE instrument between 2014 and 2018, retrieving a chromophore absorption spectrum directly from the North Equatorial Belt, and applying it to model spatial variations in colour, tropospheric cloud and haze structure on Jupiter. We found that we could model both the belts and the Great Red Spot of Jupiter using the same chromophore compound, but that this chromophore must exhibit a steeper blue-absorption gradient than the proposed chromophore of Carlson et al. (2016). We retrieved this chromophore to be located no deeper than 0.2 +/- 0.1 bars in the Great Red Spot and 0.7 +/- 0.1 bars elsewhere on Jupiter. However, we also identified some spectral variability between 510 nm and 540 nm that could not be accounted for by a universal chromophore. In addition, we retrieved a thick, global cloud layer at 1.4 +/- 0.3 bars that was relatively spatially invariant in altitude across Jupiter. We found that this cloud layer was best characterised by a real refractive index close to that of ammonia ice in the belts and the Great Red Spot, and poorly characterised by a real refractive index of 1.6 or greater. This may be the result of ammonia cloud at higher altitude obscuring a deeper cloud layer of unknown composition.	[Braude, Ashwin S.; Irwin, Patrick G.

We summarize the results in terms of state vectors, mean orbital elements, and orbital uncertainties. The estimated masses of the two innermost moons, Naiad and Thalassa, are GA/Naiad = 0.0080 +/- 0.0043 km(3) s(-2) and GM(Thalassa) = 0.0236 +/- 0.0064 km(3) s(-2), corresponding to densities of 0.80 +/- 0.48 g cm(-3) and 1.23 +/- 0.43 g cm(-3), respectively. Our analysis shows that Naiad and Thalassa are locked in an unusual type of orbital resonance. The resonant argument 73(gamma)over dot(Thalassa) -69(gamma)over dot(Naiad) -4(Omega) over dot(Naiad) approximate to 0 librates around 180 degrees with an average amplitude of similar to 66 degrees and a period of similar to 1.9 years for the nominal set of masses. This is the first fourth-order resonance discovered between the moons of the outer planets. More high precision astrometry is needed to better constrain the masses of Naiad and Thalassa, and consequently, the amplitude and the period of libration. We also report on a 13:11 near-resonance of Hippocamp and Proteus, which may lead to a mass estimate of Proteus provided that there are future observations of Hippocamp. Our fit yielded a value for Neptune's oblateness coefficient of J(2) = 3409.1 +/- 2.9 x 10(-6).

Seismicity on tidally active solid-surface worlds	ICARUS			English	Article							SUBSURFACE OCEAN; LUNAR SEISMICITY; ICE SHELL; DISSIPATION; OSCILLATIONS; STRESSES; ECCENTRICITY; MODULATION; MOONQUAKES; MODEL	Tidal interactions between planets or stars and the bodies that orbit them dissipate energy in their interiors. The dissipated energy heats the interior and a fraction of that energy will be released as seismic energy. Here we formalize a model to describe the tidally-driven seismic activity on planetary bodies based on tidal dissipation. To constrain the parameters of our model we use the seismic activity of the Moon, driven by tidal dissipation from the Earth-Moon interactions. We then apply this model to predict the amount of seismic energy release and largest seismic events on other moons in our Solar System and exoplanetary bodies. We find that many moons in the Solar System should be more seismically active than the Earth's Moon and many exoplanets should exhibit more seismic activity than the Earth. Finally, we examine how temporal-spatial variations in tidal dissipation manifest as variations in the locations and timing of seismic events on these bodies.	[Hurford, T. A.; Henning, W.

In this work, we report the results of a series of experiments that were done in the GEER facility at Glenn Research Center to investigate the homogeneity of CO2/N-2 gas mixtures at 100 bars and temperatures ranging from similar to 296 K to similar to 735 K. When the gas mixtures are initially well-mixed, separation of the two gases based on their molecular mass does not occur over the time scales observed; although, small systematic variations in composition remain to be fully interpreted. However, when N-2 is injected on top of CO2 (layered fill), the very large density ratio makes it more difficult to mix the two chemical species. Timescales of mixing are of the order of 10(2) hours over the height of the test vessel (roughly 60 cm), and even longer when the gas mixture is at rest and only molecular diffusion is occurring. At room temperature, close to the critical point of the mixture, large pressure variations are obtained for the layered fill, as N-2 slowly mixes into CO2. This can be explained by large density variations induced by the mixing. For conditions relevant to the near-surface atmosphere of Venus, separation of CO2 and N-2 based on their molecular mass and due to physical properties of the gas mixture is not demonstrated, but cannot be firmly excluded either. This suggests that if the compositional vertical gradient deduced from the VeGa-2 temperature profile is to be trusted, it would most probably be due to some extrinsic processes (not related to gas properties, e.g. CO2 volcanic inputs) and large mixing time constants.

The Mars crust beneath the lander is subject to complex geologic history next to the great topographic and crustal dichotomy of Mars. Understanding this part of the Martian crust in the subsurface would aid future investigations of the internal structure of the planet based on seismic datasets collected by the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) instrument. Here, we investigate the subsurface structure and composition from the analysis of mineralogy and morphology of exposures in impact craters as well as on scarps and knobs in the general region of Elysium Planitia. Using a combination of orbital datasets, we identify exposures of subsurface materials with distinct composition and physical properties. We find olivine and pyroxene detections associated with small impact craters (1.5-7 km) rim in the vicinity of InSight lander, as well as in the transition unit and Elysium volcanic unit. Fe/Mg phyllosilicates have been identified in the central peak of the 51-km diameter Kalpin crater and on knobs in the transition unit between the dichotomy and the plains. In addition, eroded meter-scale layered unit subject to erosion has been identified in six impact craters to the north-east of the landing site, including Kalpin crater. Massive bedrock and layered, weak materials co-occur in the transition unit, indicating a complex origin. These results together suggest both materials with altered composition and layered deposit occur as distinct geologic units beneath the basaltic lava flow units. Through analogy with terrestrial sedimentary rocks or clay-bearing sediments, we suggest physically weak materials exist beneath the lava flow units in the general region of Elysium Planitia. The spatial distribution and continuity of these materials are unclear due to the lack of exposures within the lava flow unit where the InSight lander is located. These subsurface materials of distinct physical properties may result in increased attenuation or reverberations of seismic waves, to be collected by SEIS. The findings suggest a close investigation of the potential effects of subsurface stratigraphy on seismic data would help inform future data interpretation and understanding of the internal structure of Mars.

Inputs to the model have been provided by 2D (r-z) axisymmetric simulations that were guided by measurements of the ion velocity field from laser induced fluorescence diagnostics. The combined analyses yield very good agreement with thrust measurements from ground tests of the SPT-140, a Hall thruster operating with an external cathode, and suggest two new findings. First, at intermediate pressures (similar to 9-15 mu Torr) the rise of the thrust with increasing pressure is largely due to fast atoms produced by charge exchange collisions with beam ions. The acceleration region remains spatially invariant and the thrust rise is linear with pressure. As the pressure increases further, displacements of the acceleration region towards the anode become sizeable and reduce the rate of increase in thrust. Second, the thrust increase from vacuum to the lower values of pressure (less than or similar to 9 mu Torr) is driven largely by transport of electrons along magnetic lines, from the cathode to the near-plume of the thruster, which explains why the rise is nonlinear with pressure. It is argued based on first-principles that this higher rate of thrust variation observed at the lowest pressures may be strongly linked to the highly asymmetric distribution of the external-cathode electrons around the discharge. This would explain the insensitivity of performance in thrusters with centrally-mounted cathodes as well as the longstanding challenges 2D axisymmetric simulations have had in uncovering the source of the thrust dependence on facility pressure.

Numerical simulations	PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Hall thruster; facility effects; plasma simulations	LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; ELECTRON SOURCES; WEAR MECHANISMS; ION PROPULSION	We employ the 2D (r-z) code Hall2De to conduct numerical simulations of the SPT-140, a Hall thruster that operates with an external hollow cathode. The simulations are informed by direct measurements of the plasma conditions in the acceleration channel that were obtained using the laser-induced fluorescence technique. We validate our simulation results with additional plasma measurements, wear test erosion rates, and performance data as a function of background pressure. The comparisons of the simulation results with thrust measurements provide insight into the longstanding question of how background pressure affects Hall thruster performance. We find that in thrusters with an external cathode changes in the thrust with varying backpressure can be partially explained by changes in the plasma density near the cathode. We argue that such changes in the density affect the voltage coupling and, eventually, the thrust. However, accounting for this mechanism alone in the simulations over-predicts the thrust measured during ground tests for backpressures less than 10 mu Torr. Also, at these backpressures, the measurements showed a higher rate of change of the thrust compared to the simulations. We propose that one explanation for this discrepancy is that the acceleration region may be axially shifting downstream with decreasing backpressure. Though possible, we also recognize that such shifts are not observed in LIF measurements at the lowest pressures for which such diagnostics are possible. We discuss alternative explanations in Part II of this article.

The simulations for the first time capture very well the characteristic rise of the peak-to-peak amplitude in the keeper voltage oscillations with decreasing flow rate-the so-called 'plume margin'-thereby allowing for a closer interrogation of the processes that drive them. The oscillations are found to be due to plasma dynamics in the near-plume region that increase in amplitude as the flow rate is reduced. The cathode interior remains largely quiescent and changes in the emitter peak temperature do not exceed 2% across the entire range of flow rates examined. Along the cathode centerline the amplitude of the electron density oscillations peak at a location where the number density of the Xe atoms has diminished to its minimum value and the degree of ionization is close to one. The computed spectra reveal that most of the oscillation power resides in the frequency range of 100-300 kHz. These frequencies are much greater than the local ionization collision frequency (nu(I)(eA) < 10 kHz), and are associated with wavelengths of several centimeters. Such wavelengths are many orders of magnitude greater than lambda(D). The waves are largely longitudinal with wave vector in the axial direction, and phase velocity omega/k > 10 km s(-1), which is more than 6x greater than the ion acoustic speed. Though the computed and measured plume margins are in good agreement the measured spectra show that most of the power resides between similar to 60 and 90 kHz, lower than the computed range (100-300 kHz), and exhibits a sharper distribution. It is argued this is due to the presence of a rotational mode in the experiment that is coupled with the longitudinal mode, yielding a complex 3D plasma motion that cannot be captured by the simulations due to the assumption of azimuthal axisymmetry, but that it is indeed the longitudinal plasma motion that drives the transition from spot to plume modes. An anomalous resistivity has been invoked in the simulations that is based on the formulations of Sagdeev and Galeev for the saturation of IAT which is long known to exist in these discharges. Though the simulations do not account for possible anomalous heating of the ions, the idealized model for the electrons is found to be sufficient in capturing the abovementioned dynamics, yielding a multiplication coefficient alpha of the anomalous collision frequency nu(alpha) = alpha omega(pe)(T-e/T-i)(u(e)/u(Te)) that is within a factor of two of the estimated theoretical value.

We find a radio core detection fraction of 96 per cent, much higher than lower frequency radio surveys. Of the 96 radio-detected AGN, 55 have compact morphologies, 30 have morphologies consistent with nuclear star formation, and 11 have sub-kpc to kpc-scale jets. We find that the total radio power does not distinguish between nuclear star formation and jets as the origin of the radio emission. For 87 objects, we use optical spectroscopy to test whether AGN physical parameters are distinct between radio morphological types. We find that X-ray luminosities tend to be higher if the 22 GHz morphology is jet-like, but find no significant difference in other physical parameters. We find that the relationship between the X-ray and core radio luminosities is consistent with the L-R/L-X similar to 10(-5) of coronally active stars. We further find that the canonical fundamental planes of black hole activity systematically overpredict our radio luminosities, particularly for objects with star formation morphologies.

We describe our automated spectral classification scheme and arrive at a final set of 626 spectra (of 242 objects) that are unambiguously classified as belonging to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Of these, 70 spectra of 30 objects are classified as spectroscopically peculiar (i.e. not matching the spectral signatures of 'normal' SNe la) and 79 SNe Ia (covered by 328 spectra) have complementary photometric coverage. The median SN in our final set has one epoch of spectroscopy, has a redshift of 0,0208 (with a low of 0.0007 and high of 0.1921), and is first observed spectroscopically 1.1 d after maximum light. The constituent spectra are of high quality, with a median signal-to-noise ratio of 31.8 pixel(-1), and have broad wavelength coverage, with similar to 95 per cent covering at least 3700-9800 angstrom. We analyse our data set, focusing on quantitative measurements (e.g, velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths) of the evolution of prominent spectral features in the available early-time and late time spectra. The data are available to the community, and we encourage future studies to incorporate our spectra in their analyses.

Double dark matter vision: twice the number of compact-source lenses with narrow-line lensing and the WFC3 grism	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: haloes; dark matter	INTEGRAL FIELD SPECTROSCOPY; STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES; BROAD EMISSION-LINES; EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; EDGE-ON DISC; GRAVITATIONAL LENSES; SATELLITE GALAXIES; DWARF GALAXIES; MASS SUBSTRUCTURE; II EMISSION	The magnifications of compact-source lenses are extremely sensitive to the presence of low mass dark matter haloes along the entire sightline from the source to the observer. Traditionally, the study of dark matter structure in compact-source strong gravitational lenses has been limited to radio-loud systems, as the radio emission is extended and thus unaffected by microlensing which can mimic the signal of dark matter structure. An alternate approach is to measure quasar nuclear-narrow-line emission, which is free from microlensing and present in virtually all quasar lenses. In this paper, we double the number of systems which can he used for gravitational lensing analyses by presenting measurements of narrow-line emission from a sample of eight quadruply imaged quasar lens systems, WGD J0405-3308, HS 0810+2554, RX.10911+0551, SDSS J1330+1810, PS J1606-2333, WFI 2026-4536, WFI 2033-4723, and WGD J2038-4008. We describe our updated grism spectral modelling pipeline, which we use to measure narrow-line fluxes with uncertainties of 2-10 per cent, presented here. We fit the lensed image positions with smooth mass models and demonstrate that these models fail to produce the observed distribution of image fluxes over the entire sample of lenses. Furthermore, typical deviations are larger than those expected from macromodel uncertainties. This discrepancy indicates the presence of perturbations caused by small-scale dark matter structure. The interpretation of this result in terms of dark matter models is presented in a companion paper.	[Nierenberg, A.

The Radio Scream from black holes at Cosmic Dawn: a semi-analytic model for the impact of radio-loud black holes on the 21 cm global signal	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: high-redshilt-galaxies: intergalactic medium -quasars: general cosmology: dark ages; reionization; first stars -radio continuum: general	COMPACT STEEP-SPECTRUM; X-RAY-SPECTRA; 21-CM SIGNAL; 1ST STARS; SYNCHROTRON SPECTRA; EDDINGTON RATIOS; DARK-MATTER; DUTY CYCLES; REDSHIFT; REIONIZATION	We use a semi -analytic model to explore the potential impact of a brief and violent period of radio -loud accretion on to black holes (The Radio Scream) during the Cosmic Dawn on the 1-11 hyperfine 21cm signal. We find that radio emission from supermassive black hole seeds can impact the global 21 cm signal at the level of tens to hundreds of per cent provided that they were as radio loud as z 1 black holes and obscured by gas with column depths of N0 1023 CM 2. We determine plausible sets of parameters that reproduce some of the striking features of the EDGES absorption feature including its depth, timing, and side steepness while producing radio/X-ray backgrounds and source counts that are consistent with published limits. Scenarios yielding a dramatic 21 cm signature also predict large populations of 1,1iy point sources that will be detectable in future deep surveys from the Square Kilometer Array (SKI). Thus, 21 cm measurements, complemented by deep point -source surveys, have the potential to constrain optimistic scenarios where supermassive black hole progenitors were radio loud,	[Ewall-Wice, Aaron; Chang, Tzu-Ching; Lazio, T.

Simulating Serpentinization as It Could Apply to the Emergence of Life Using the JPL Hydrothermal Reactor	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Emergence of life; Hydrothermal reactor; Serpentinization; Methane; Formate	EAST PACIFIC RISE; HOT-SPRINGS; ULTRAMAFIC ROCKS; ORGANIC-ACIDS; GREEN RUST; ORIGIN; METHANE; HYDROGEN; RIDGE; CO2	The molecules feeding life's emergence are thought to have been provided through the hydrothermal interactions of convecting carbonic ocean waters with minerals comprising the early Hadean oceanic crust. Few laboratory experiments have simulated ancient hydrothermal conditions to test this conjecture. We used the JPL hydrothermal flow reactor to investigate CO2 reduction in simulated ancient alkaline convective systems over 3 days (T = 120 degrees C, P = 100 bar, pH = 11). H-2-rich hydrothermal simulant and CO2-rich ocean simulant solutions were periodically driven in 4-h cycles through synthetic mafic and ultramafic substrates and Fe>Ni sulfides. The resulting reductants included micromoles of HS- and formate accompanied possibly by micromoles of acetate and intermittent minor bursts of methane as ascertained by isotopic labeling. The formate concentrations directly correlated with the CO2 input as well as with millimoles of Mg2+ ions, whereas the acetate did not. Also, tens of micromoles of methane were drawn continuously from the reactor materials during what appeared to be the onset of serpentinization. These results support the hypothesis that formate may have been delivered directly to a branch of an emerging acetyl coenzyme-A pathway, thus obviating the need for the very first hydrogenation of CO2 to be made in a hydrothermal mound. Another feed to early metabolism could have been methane, likely mostly leached from primary CH4 present in the original Hadean crust or emanating from the mantle. That a small volume of methane was produced sporadically from the (CO2)-C-13-feed, perhaps from transient occlusions, echoes the mixed results and interpretations from other laboratories. As serpentinization and hydrothermal leaching can occur wherever an ocean convects within anhydrous olivine- and sulfide-rich crust, these results may be generalized to other wet rocky planets and moons in our solar system and beyond.

Toward ultrafast, ultra-stable imaging arrays: Superlattice doping to enhance the performance of backside-illuminated 3D-hybridized silicon photodetectors	JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A			English	Article							MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY; SB SURFACE SEGREGATION; CHARGE-COUPLED-DEVICE; QUANTUM EFFICIENCY; LOW-TEMPERATURE; DETECTORS	In this paper, the authors report the latest results on their development of superlattice-doped, thinned, backside-illuminated (BSI), 3D-integrated photodiode detectors-a step toward their ultimate goal of demonstrating ultrafast, ultrastable CMOS imaging arrays. As with most silicon-based photodetectors, backside-illumination and backside surface passivation are keys to achieve the highest performance capability. The two-dimensional (2D) doping technique developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has proved to result in a highly efficient, highly stable detector response when combined with a variety of detectors. Here, JPL's 2D-doping has been combined with Sandia's BSI photodetectors hybridized with custom fanout wafer via copper Direct Bond Interconnect (DBI (R)), a technology that is rapidly becoming industry standard for BSI CMOS imaging arrays. The prototype detectors were packaged and evaluated with respect to their response to low energy electrons. The authors find that the responsivity of 2D-doped BSI detectors is higher than devices prepared using other surface passivation techniques (i.e., ion implantation). The success of the work described herein verifies that the 2D-doping processes previously developed for Sandia's frontside-illuminated photodetectors are generally applicable to BSI detectors and demonstrates for the first time that JPL's 2D-doping process is compatible with the Cu-DBI (R) technology.

J	Marshall, MA; Goel, A; Pellegrino, S				Marshall, Michael A.; Goel, Ashish; Pellegrino, Sergio			Power-Optimal Guidance for Planar Space Solar Power Satellites	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							RADIATION PRESSURE; TRANSMISSION; ATTITUDE; SUN	This paper presents power-optimal guidance for a planar space solar power satellite (SSPS). Power-optimal guidance is the attitude trajectory that maximizes the solar power transmitted by the SSPS. Planarity is important because it couples the orientations of the SSPS's photovoltaic and antenna surfaces. Hence, the transmitted power depends on the relative geometry between the SSPS, the sun, and the receiving station. The orientation that maximizes power transfer changes as this relative geometry changes. Both single- and dual-sided SSPS architectures are considered. A single-sided SSPS has one photovoltaic surface and one antenna surface. A dual-sided SSPS is a single-sided SSPS with at least one additional photovoltaic or antenna surface. Geometric arguments show that a dual-sided SSPS has superior performance to a single-sided SSPS. Power-optimal guidance is then presented for the special cases of SSPSs in geostationary Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, and low Earth orbit transmitting to an equatorial receiving station at the time of Earth's vernal equinox. These examples emphasize important solution properties, including the need for large slew maneuvers, and they show that, even though system efficiency decreases as orbit altitude decreases, reduced path losses actually increase the amount of received energy per unit aperture area. This has significant system implications for future space solar power missions.

In this article, methods for predicting gate voltage overshoot in normally-OFF gallium nitride (GAN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are derived in order to deliver optimal device performance. Two models are proposed; a simple, yet less accurate second order model and a complex, yet more accurate fourth order model. These models allow for the calculation of gate resistances necessary for a desired amount of gate voltage overshoot. The nonlinear capacitances of the device are considered in the analysis. The models are validated with an experimental double-pulse tester. These newly developed models allow design engineers to extract the best possible performance of commercially available GaN devices while keeping the devices in their safe-operating region.

Jupiter's Gravity Field Halfway Through the Juno Mission	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ROTATION	The Juno spacecraft reached the mid-point of its nominal mission in December 2018, after completing 17 perijove passes. Ten of these were dedicated to the determination of the gravity field of the planet, with the aim of constraining its interior structure. We provide an update on Jupiter's gravity field, its tidal response and spin axis motion over time. The analysis of the Doppler data collected during the perijove passes hints to a non-static and/or non-axially symmetric field, possibly related to several different physical mechanisms, such as normal modes or localized atmospheric or deeply-rooted dynamics. Plain Language Summary Jupiter's gravity field has been updated with the use of Juno's data collected up to the mid-point of its mission. The field is largely symmetric about the rotation axis, and shows conspicuous north-south asymmetry. Possible non-static and/or non-axially symmetric field is compatible with the data.

COSMIC-2 Radio Occultation Constellation: First Results	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LOWER TROPOSPHERE; REFRACTIVITY; SIGNALS	Initial data from the Formosa Satellite-7/Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2, hereafter C2), a recently launched equatorial constellation of six satellites carrying advanced radio occultation receivers, exhibit high signal-to-noise ratio, precision, and accuracy, and the ability to provide high vertical resolution profiles of bending angles and refractivity, which contain information on temperature and water vapor in the challenging tropical atmosphere. After an initial calibration/validation phase, over 100,000 soundings of bending angles and refractivity that passed quality control in October 2019 are compared with independent data, including radiosondes, model forecasts, and analyses. The comparisons show that C2 data meet expectations of high accuracy, precision, and capability to detect superrefraction. When fully operational, the C2 satellites are expected to produce similar to 5,000 soundings per day, providing freely available observations that will enable improved forecasts of weather, including tropical cyclones, and weather, space weather, and climate research. Plain Language Summary This paper describes an initial quality assessment of satellite observations from a recently launched (25 June 2019) constellation of six satellites that orbit Earth over the tropics. The approximately 5,000 vertical profiles per day, obtained using a relatively new technique called radio occultation, provide information of unprecedented quality on the temperature and water vapor in the tropics. These observations, which are freely available to forecasters and researchers worldwide, will be useful in improving forecasts of weather, including tropical cyclones, and supporting weather and climate research.

Rapid Formation of Clathrate Hydrate From Liquid Ethane and Water Ice on Titan	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; METHANE; KINETICS; EQUILIBRIUM; SYSTEM; HEAT	Liquid ethane is present in the lakes and seas observed on Titan's surface by the Cassini-Huygens mission. While interaction between liquid hydrocarbons and water ice is expected to result in the formation of clathrate hydrates, such reaction (and its kinetics) has not yet been demonstrated for cryogenic liquids under relevant planetary conditions. In this paper, we report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of clathrates upon direct contact of liquid ethane with water ice at 1 bar using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Kinetics experiments conducted in the temperature range 150-173 K yield an activation energy of 14.8 +/- 2.2 kJ/mol, which is suggestive of a diffusion-controlled mechanism for clathrate formation. This implies that a clathrate reservoir can form within seasonal time scales on Titan if liquid ethane comes into contact with a pre-existing icy bedrock, which may hold important implications for the structure and dynamics of Titan's crust and its global evolution. Plain Language Summary Saturn's moon Titan has a dense atmosphere and liquid lakes (of methane and ethane) on its surface. These organic compounds are the main constituents of natural gas on Earth. Water is completely frozen and comprises most of Titan's bedrock materials. Under the right conditions, it is common for water ice to form new solids that trap natural gas in their structures, called clathrate hydrates. On Earth, clathrate hydrates are often found in the permafrost and deep ocean. However, Titan is so much colder that these natural gases exist as liquids. We do not yet know if clathrates can form under such conditions, and if so, how quickly. In this study, we prepared small grains of water ice, bathed them in liquid ethane, and monitored the rate at which clathrate hydrates appear. Our data confirm that clathrates would indeed form on Titan from an ethane lake or rain event onto water ice, and they would do so very quickly (in just a few Earth years). This suggests that clathrate hydrates can be an important material on Titan that may be encountered by future missions there.	[Vu, T.

In January 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew past one of these objects, the 36-kilometer-long contact binary (486958) Arrokoth (provisional designation 2014 MU69). Images from the flyby show that Arrokoth has no detectable rings, and no satellites (larger than 180 meters in diameter) within a radius of 8000 kilometers. Arrokoth has a lightly cratered, smooth surface with complex geological features, unlike those on previously visited Solar System bodies. The density of impact craters indicates the surface dates from the formation of the Solar System. The two lobes of the contact binary have closely aligned poles and equators, constraining their accretion mechanism.	[Spencer, J. R.; Stern, S. A.; Singer, K. N.; Olkin, C. B.; Parker, J.

Color, composition, and thermal environment of Kuiper Belt object (486958) Arrokoth	SCIENCE			English	Article							OUTER SOLAR-SYSTEM; PLANETESIMAL FORMATION; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; ICE; SURFACE; BODIES; MODEL; WATER; INTERSTELLAR; IRRADIATION	The outer Solar System object (486958) Arrokoth (provisional designation 2014 MU69) has been largely undisturbed since its formation. We studied its surface composition using data collected by the New Horizons spacecraft. Methanol ice is present along with organic material, which may have formed through irradiation of simple molecules. Water ice was not detected. This composition indicates hydrogenation of carbon monoxide-rich ice and/or energetic processing of methane condensed on water ice grains in the cold, outer edge of the early Solar System. There are only small regional variations in color and spectra across the surface, which suggests that Arrokoth formed from a homogeneous or well-mixed reservoir of solids. Microwave thermal emission from the winter night side is consistent with a mean brightness temperature of 29 +/- 5 kelvin.	[Grundy, W. M.] Lowell Observ, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Grundy, W.

Fire Effects on Understory Forest Regeneration in Southern Amazonia	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						carbon; basal area; diversity; regeneration; resilience; richness; seedling; selective logging	INDUCED TREE MORTALITY; RIO NEGRO REGION; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; DROUGHT SENSITIVITY; LAND-USE; CARBON; DISTURBANCE; BIODIVERSITY; SAVANNA; CLASSIFICATION	Fire in tropical forests increases tree mortality, degrades forest structure, and reduces carbon stocks. Currently, there are large gaps in understanding how fire affects understory forest structure and composition, interactions with fire recurrence, and long-term impacts. Understanding these changes is critical to evaluate the present and future response of tropical forests to fire. We studied post-fire changes in understory regeneration in forests in Mato Grosso State, southern Amazonia, Brazil, aiming to answer the following questions: (i) does forest structure (basal area) and tree community composition vary with fire frequency and time since the last fire? (ii) does the response differ among strata (e.g., sapling, larger trees)? (iii) are changes in diversity associated with changes in forest structure? We surveyed trees and lianas in previously structurally intact forests that underwent selective logging, followed by different fire histories, including 5 and 16 years after once-burned, 5 years after three times burned, and unburned (control). Overall, species composition (abundance, richness, and number of families) and diversity were highest for the unburned treatment and lowest for the recurrent burned areas. Fire frequency negatively affected plant structure and basal area; basal area of small, medium, and large plants declined significantly by more than 50% in the most frequently burned areas. Richness was positively related to basal area in the three times burned sites and in the 16 years regenerating site for all strata. Our results demonstrate the negative influence of frequent fires on both the composition and structure of small trees in Amazonian forest. These changes to the cohort of small-sized trees may persist and have long-term impacts on forest structure, affecting the capacity, and direction of forest recovery. With wildfire widespread across the region and increasing in frequency, fire may negatively affect tree diversity in remaining selectively logged forests, and affect regional carbon cycling with consequences for the global vegetation carbon sink.

Cloud formation in the atomic and molecular phase: H I self absorption (HISA) towards a giant molecular filament	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: atoms; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; radio lines: ISM; stars: formation	COLUMN DENSITY; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; COLD HYDROGEN; DARK CLOUDS; TEMPERATURE; TRANSITION; RIEGEL; LINE; GAS; EXTINCTION	Molecular clouds form from the atomic phase of the interstellar medium. However, characterizing the transition between the atomic and the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex observational task. Here we address cloud formation processes by combining HI self absorption (HISA) with molecular line data. Column density probability density functions (N-PDFs) are a common tool for examining molecular clouds. One scenario proposed by numerical simulations is that the N-PDF evolves from a log-normal shape at early times to a power-law-like shape at later times. To date, investigations of N-PDFs have been mostly limited to the molecular component of the cloud. In this paper, we study the cold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38.1-32.4a (GMF38a, distance = 3.4 kpc, length similar to 230 pc), calculate its N-PDFs, and study its kinematics. We identify an extended HISA feature, which is partly correlated with the (CO)-C-13 emission. The peak velocities of the HISA and (CO)-C-13 observations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity offset of approximately 4 km s(-1) is found on the western side. The sonic Mach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large fraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at subsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM part is on the order of 10(20) to 10(21) cm(-2). The column density of molecular hydrogen, traced by (CO)-C-13, is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI emission (the warm and cold neutral medium), and (CO)-C-13 (molecular component) are well described by log-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the main driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows a power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We suggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the filament. The eastern subregion seems to be forming a molecular cloud out of the atomic gas, whereas the western subregion already shows high column density peaks, active star formation, and evidence of related feedback processes.

Impact of a charged neighboring particle on Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						metal nanoparticle; Green's tensor; Forster resonance energy transfer; effective dielectric function	QUANTUM-DOT; VIRTUAL PHOTONS; FLUORESCENCE; BIOSENSORS; LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ABSORPTION; GRAPHENE; SPASER; CANCER	Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an important physical phenomenon which demands precise control over the FRET rate for its wide range of applications. Hence, enhancing the FRET rate using different techniques has been extensively studied in the literature. Research indicates that introducing additional particles to a system consisting of a donor-acceptor pair can change the behaviour of FRET in the system. One such technique is to utilize the collective oscillations of the surface electrons of a neighboring electrically-neutral metal nanoparticle (MNP). However, the perceived changes on the FRET rate between the donor and the acceptor, when the MNP carries excess electrical charges are yet unknown. In this paper, we study these changes by introducing a charged MNP, in the proximity of an excited donor and a ground state acceptor. We deploy the classical Green's tensor to express the FRET rate in the system. We consider an effective dielectric response for the MNP, which accounts for the extraneous surface charge effects. We analyze the electrical potential at the acceptor position due to the changed dipole moment of the donor molecule as a result of the electric field induced at the donor position, and obtain the FRET rate of the system. This model considers arbitrary locations and orientations of the two molecular dipole moments with regard to the position of the spherical MNP. We present the enhancement of the FRET rate, predominantly caused by both the surface plasmon excitations and the extraneous surface electrical charges carried by the neighboring MNP. We obtain the results by varying the separation distance between the molecules and the MNP, the transition frequency of the donor-acceptor pair and the size of the metallic sphere. Specifically, we demonstrate that a donor-acceptor pair placed in the vicinity of an electrically-charged Silver MNP exhibits a remarkable improvement in the FRET rate. Furthermore, the aggregate FRET enhancement is determined by other characteristics such as the location of the donor, transition frequency, separation distances and the radius of the MNP. In essence, these findings reveal an approach to realize the enhanced FRET rate in a larger span in a more controlled manner that is desirable in many FRET-based applications including spectroscopic measurements.

J	Tsurutani, BT; Lakhina, GS; Hajra, R				Tsurutani, Bruce T.; Lakhina, Gurbax S.; Hajra, Rajkumar			The physics of space weather/solar-terrestrial physics (STP): what we know now and what the current and future challenges are	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							ACTIVITY HILDCAA EVENTS; 1-2 SEPTEMBER 1859; INTERPLANETARY MAGNETIC-FIELD; RADIATION-BELT ELECTRONS; SOLAR-WIND STREAMS; INTER-PLANETARY SHOCK; CORONAL MASS EJECTION; ULTRA-LOW FREQUENCY; RING CURRENT; HIGH-INTENSITY	Major geomagnetic storms are caused by unusually intense solar wind southward magnetic fields that impinge upon the Earth's magnetosphere (Dungey, 1961). How can we predict the occurrence of future interplanetary events? Do we currently know enough of the underlying physics and do we have sufficient observations of solar wind phenomena that will impinge upon the Earth's magnetosphere? We view this as the most important challenge in space weather. We discuss the case for magnetic clouds (MCs), interplanetary sheaths upstream of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), corotating interaction regions (CIRs) and solar wind high-speed streams (HS Ss). The sheath- and CIR-related magnetic storms will be difficult to predict and will require better knowledge of the slow solar wind and modeling to solve. For interplanetary space weather, there are challenges for understanding the fluences and spectra of solar energetic particles (SEPs). This will require better knowledge of interplanetary shock properties as they propagate and evolve going from the Sun to 1 AU (and beyond), the upstream slow solar wind and energetic "seed" particles. Dayside aurora, triggering of nightside substorms, and formation of new radiation belts can all be caused by shock and interplanetary ram pressure impingements onto the Earth's magnetosphere. The acceleration and loss of relativistic magnetospheric "killer" electrons and prompt penetrating electric fields in terms of causing positive and negative ionospheric storms are reasonably well understood, but refinements are still needed. The forecasting of extreme events (extreme shocks, extreme solar energetic particle events, and extreme geomagnetic storms (Carrington events or greater)) are also discussed. Energetic particle precipitation into the atmosphere and ozone destruction are briefly discussed. For many of the studies, the Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), Arase, and SWARM data will be useful.

Geology of the InSight landing site on Mars	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; ELYSIUM PLANITIA; CERBERUS FOSSAE; BRITTLE SOLIDS; FRAGMENT SIZE; SPIRIT; LOCALIZATION; FRACTURE; CRATER; ROCKS	The Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) spacecraft landed successfully on Mars and imaged the surface to characterize the surficial geology. Here we report on the geology and subsurface structure of the landing site to aid in situ geophysical investigations. InSight landed in a degraded impact crater in Elysium Planitia on a smooth sandy, granule- and pebble-rich surface with few rocks. Superposed impact craters are common and eolian bedforms are sparse. During landing, pulsed retrorockets modified the surface to reveal a near surface stratigraphy of surficial dust, over thin unconsolidated sand, underlain by a variable thickness duricrust, with poorly sorted, unconsolidated sand with rocks beneath. Impact, eolian, and mass wasting processes have dominantly modified the surface. Surface observations are consistent with expectations made from remote sensing data prior to landing indicating a surface composed of an impact-fragmented regolith overlying basaltic lava flows. The InSight spacecraft landed on Mars on November 2018. Here, the authors characterize the surficial geology of the landing site and compare with observations and models derived from remote sensing data prior to landing and from ongoing in situ geophysical investigations of the subsurface.

Biogeography of American Northwest Hot Spring A/B '-Lineage Synechococcus Populations	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						ecotype; microbial species; population genetics; thermophilic Synechococcus; biogeography	YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARK; MICROBIAL MAT COMMUNITY; MICROORGANISMS; DIVERSITY; ECOTYPES; FLIES; UNITS	Previous analyses have shown how diversity among unicellular cyanobacteria inhabiting island-like hot springs is structured relative to physical separation and physiochemical differences among springs, especially at local to regional scales. However, these studies have been limited by the low resolution provided by the molecular markers surveyed. We analyzed large datasets obtained by high-throughput sequencing of a segment of the photosynthesis gene psaA from samples collected in hot springs from geothermal basins in Yellowstone National Park, Montana, and Oregon, all known from previous studies to contain populations of A/B '-lineage Synechococcus. The fraction of identical sequences was greater among springs separated by 50 km, and springs separated by >800 km shared sequence variants only rarely. Phylogenetic analyses provided evidence for endemic lineages that could be related to geographic isolation and/or geochemical differences on regional scales. Ecotype Simulation 2 was used to predict putative ecotypes (ecologically distinct populations), and their membership, and canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the geographical and geochemical bases for variation in their distribution. Across the range of Oregon and Yellowstone, geographical separation explained the largest percentage of the differences in distribution of ecotypes (9.5% correlated to longitude; 9.4% to latitude), with geochemical differences explaining the largest percentage of the remaining differences in distribution (7.4-9.3% correlated to magnesium, sulfate, and sulfide). Among samples within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, geochemical differences significantly explained the distribution of ecotypes (6.5-9.3% correlated to magnesium, boron, sulfate, silicon dioxide, chloride, and pH). Nevertheless, differences in the abundance and membership of ecotypes in Yellowstone springs with similar chemistry suggested that allopatry may be involved even at local scales. Synechococcus populations have diverged both by physical isolation and physiochemical differences, and populations on surprisingly local scales have been evolving independently.

Image formation process with the solar gravitational lens	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We study image formation with the solar gravitational lens (SGL). We consider a point source that is positioned at a large but finite distance from the Sun. We assume that an optical telescope is positioned in the image plane, in the focal region of the SGL. We model the telescope as a convex lens and evaluate the intensity distribution produced by the electromagnetic field that forms the image in the focal plane of the convex lens. We first investigate the case when the telescope is located on the optical axis of the SGL or in its immediate vicinity. This is the region of strong interference where the SGL forms an image of a distant source, which is our primary interest. We derive analytic expressions that describe the progression of the image from an Einstein ring corresponding to an on-axis telescope position, to the case of two bright spots when the telescope is positioned some distance away from the optical axis. At greater distances from the optical axis, in the region of weak interference and that of geometric optics, we recover expressions that are familiar from models of gravitational microlensing, but developed here using a wave-optical treatment. We discuss applications of the results for imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with the SGL.

The seismicity of Mars	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							SINGLE-STATION; MAGNITUDE; LOCATION; STRESS; EARTH	The InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission landed in Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018 and fully deployed its seismometer by the end of February 2019. The mission aims to detect, characterize and locate seismic activity on Mars, and to further constrain the internal structure, composition and dynamics of the planet. Here, we present seismometer data recorded until 30 September 2019, which reveal that Mars is seismically active. We identify 174 marsquakes, comprising two distinct populations: 150 small-magnitude, high-frequency events with waves propagating at crustal depths and 24 low-frequency, subcrustal events of magnitude M-w 3-4 with waves propagating at various depths in the mantle. These marsquakes have spectral characteristics similar to the seismicity observed on the Earth and Moon. We determine that two of the largest detected marsquakes were located near the Cerberus Fossae fracture system. From the recorded seismicity, we constrain attenuation in the crust and mantle, and find indications of a potential low-S-wave-velocity layer in the upper mantle. Mars is seismically active: 24 subcrustal magnitude 3-4 marsquakes and 150 smaller events have been identified up to 30 September 2019, by an analysis of seismometer data from the InSight lander.

Optical Characterization of the Keck Array and BICEP3 CMB Polarimeters from 2016 to 2019	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic microwave background; Inflation; Polarization; Transition-edge sensor; Keck Array; BICEP3		The BICEP/Keck experiment (BK) is a series of small-aperture refracting telescopes observing degree-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization from the South Pole in search of a primordial B-mode signature. This B-mode signal arises from primordial gravitational waves interacting with the CMB and has amplitude parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. Since 2016, BICEP3 and the Keck Array have been observing with 4800 total antenna-coupled transition-edge sensor detectors, with frequency bands spanning 95, 150, 220, and 270 GHz. Here we present the optical performance of these receivers from 2016 to 2019, including far-field beams measured in situ with an improved chopped thermal source and instrument spectral response measured with a field-deployable Fourier transform spectrometer. As a pair differencing experiment, an important systematic that must be controlled is the differential beam response between the co-located, orthogonally polarized detectors. We generate per-detector far-field beam maps and the corresponding differential beam mismatch that is used to estimate the temperature-to-polarization leakage in our CMB maps and to give feedback on detector and optics fabrication. The differential beam parameters presented here were estimated using improved low-level beam map analysis techniques, including efficient removal of non-Gaussian noise as well as improved spatial masking. These techniques help minimize systematic uncertainty in the beam analysis, with the goal of constraining the bias on r induced by temperature-to-polarization leakage to be subdominant to the statistical uncertainty. This is essential as we progress to higher detector counts in the next generation of CMB experiments.

Full-Array Noise Performance of Deployment-Grade SuperSpec mm-Wave On-Chip Spectrometers	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Kinetic inductance detectors; Spectrometer; NEP; SuperSpec; Large Millimeter Telescope; ROACH2		SuperSpec is an on-chip filter bank spectrometer designed for wideband moderate-resolution spectroscopy at millimeter wavelengths, employing TiN kinetic inductance detectors. SuperSpec technology will enable large-format spectroscopic integral field units suitable for high-redshift line intensity mapping and multi-object spectrographs. In previous results, we have demonstrated noise performance in individual detectors suitable for photon noise-limited ground-based observations at excellent mm-wave sites. In these proceedings, we present the noise performance of a full R similar to 275 spectrometer measured using deployment-ready RF hardware and software. We report typical noise equivalent powers through the full device of similar to 3x10(-16) W Hz(-1/2) at expected sky loadings, which are photon noise dominated. Based on these results, we plan to deploy a six-spectrometer demonstration instrument to the Large Millimeter Telescope in early 2020.	[Karkare, K. S.; Barry, P.

Characterizing the Sensitivity of 40 GHz TES Bolometers for BICEP Array	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmology; B-Mode polarization; Inflation; CMB; TES		The BICEP/Keck (BK) experiment aims to detect the imprint of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background polarization, which would be direct evidence of the inflation theory. While the tensor-to-scalar ratio has been constrained to be r(0.05) < 0.06 at 95% c.l., further improvements on this upper limit are hindered by polarized galactic foreground emissions and removal of gravitational lensing polarization. The 30/40 GHz receiver of the BICEP Array (BA) will deploy at the end of 2019 and will constrain the synchrotron foreground with unprecedented accuracy within the BK sky patch. We will show the design of the 30/40 GHz detectors and test results summarizing its performance. The low optical and atmospheric loading at these frequencies requires our TES detectors to have low saturation power in order to be photon noise dominated. To realize the low thermal conductivity required from a 250 mK base temperature, we developed new bolometer leg designs. We will present the relevant measured detector parameters: G, T-c, R-n, P-sat, and spectral bands, and noise spectra. We achieved a per bolometer NEP including all noise components of 2.07x10(-17) W/root Hz, including an anticipated photon noise level 1.54x10(-17) W/root Hz.	[Zhang, C.; Thakur, R. Basu; Bock, J.

Optical Design and Characterization of 40-GHz Detector and Module for the BICEP Array	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						BICEP array; Cosmology; Inflation; CMB; Antennas; Detectors; Polarization		Families of cosmic inflation models predict a primordial gravitational-wave background that imprints B-mode polarization pattern in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). High-sensitivity instruments with wide frequency coverage and well-controlled systematic errors are needed to constrain the faint B-mode amplitude. We have developed antenna-coupled transition edge sensor arrays for high-sensitivity polarized CMB observations over a wide range of millimeter-wave bands. BICEP array, the latest phase of the BICEP/Keck experiment series, is a multi-receiver experiment designed to search for inflationary B-mode polarization to a precision sigma(r) between 0.002 and 0.004 after 3 full years of observations, depending on foreground complexity and the degree of lensing removal. We describe the electromagnetic design and measured performance of BICEP array's low-frequency 40-GHz detector, their packaging in focal plane modules, and optical characterization including efficiency and beam matching between polarization pairs. We summarize the design and simulated optical performance, including an approach to improve the optical efficiency due to mismatch losses. We report the measured beam maps for a new broadband corrugation design to minimize beam differential ellipticity between polarization pairs caused by interactions with the module housing frame, which helps minimize polarized beam mismatch that converts CMB temperature to polarization (T -> P) anisotropy in CMB maps.

However, the typical lifetime of a single satellite platform is on the order of 5-15 years; thus, for climate studies, the use of multiple satellite sensors should be considered. Discrepancies exist between aerosol optical depth (AOD) products due to differences in their information content, spatial and temporal sampling, calibration, cloud masking, and algorithmic assumptions. Users of satellite-based AOD time-series are confronted with the challenge of choosing an appropriate dataset for the intended application. In this study, 16 monthly AOD products obtained from different satellite sensors and with different algorithms were inter-compared and evaluated against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) monthly AOD. Global and regional analyses indicate that products tend to agree qualitatively on the annual, seasonal and monthly timescales but may be offset in magnitude. Several approaches were then investigated to merge the AOD records from different satellites and create an optimised AOD dataset. With few exceptions, all merging approaches lead to similar results, indicating the robustness and stability of the merged AOD products. We introduce a gridded monthly AOD merged product for the period 1995-2017. We show that the quality of the merged product is as least as good as that of individual products. Optimal agreement of the AOD merged product with AERONET further demonstrates the advantage of merging multiple products. This merged dataset provides a long-term perspective on AOD changes over different regions of the world, and users are encouraged to use this dataset.

It aims to determine the interior structure, composition and thermal state of Mars, as well as constrain present-day seismicity and impact cratering rates. Such information is key to understanding the differentiation and subsequent thermal evolution of Mars, and thus the forces that shape the planet's surface geology and volatile processes. Here we report an overview of the first ten months of geophysical observations by InSight. As of 30 September 2019, 174 seismic events have been recorded by the lander's seismometer, including over 20 events of moment magnitude M-w = 3-4. The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact-induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet. An assessment of these detections suggests that the frequency of global seismic events below approximately M-w = 3 is similar to that of terrestrial intraplate seismic activity, but there are fewer larger quakes; no quakes exceeding M-w = 4 have been observed. The lander's other instruments-two cameras, atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind sensors, a magnetometer and a radiometer-have yielded much more than the intended supporting data for seismometer noise characterization: magnetic field measurements indicate a local magnetic field that is ten-times stronger than orbital estimates and meteorological measurements reveal a more dynamic atmosphere than expected, hosting baroclinic and gravity waves and convective vortices. With the mission due to last for an entire Martian year or longer, these results will be built on by further measurements by the InSight lander. Geophysical and meteorological measurements by NASA's InSight lander on Mars reveal a planet that is seismically active and provide information about the interior, surface and atmospheric workings of Mars.

As such, Mars provides an opportunity to expand our knowledge of atmospheres beyond that attainable from the atmosphere of the Earth. The InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) lander is measuring Mars's atmosphere with unprecedented continuity, accuracy and sampling frequency. Here we show that InSight unveils new atmospheric phenomena at Mars, especially in the higher-frequency range, and extends our understanding of Mars's meteorology at all scales. InSight is uniquely sensitive to large-scale and regional weather and obtained detailed in situ coverage of a regional dust storm on Mars. Images have enabled high-altitude wind speeds to be measured and revealed airglow-faint emissions produced by photochemical reactions-in the middle atmosphere. InSight observations show a paradox of aeolian science on Mars: despite having the largest recorded Martian vortex activity and dust-devil tracks close to the lander, no visible dust devils have been seen. Meteorological measurements have produced a catalogue of atmospheric gravity waves, which included bores (soliton-like waves). From these measurements, we have discovered Martian infrasound and unexpected similarities between atmospheric turbulence on Earth and Mars. We suggest that the observations of Mars's atmosphere by InSight will be key for prediction capabilities and future exploration. The InSight lander has expanded our knowledge of the atmosphere of Mars by observing various phenomena, including airglow, bores, infrasound and Earth-like turbulence.

Crustal and time-varying magnetic fields at the InSight landing site on Mars	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; MANTLE; MOON	Magnetic fields provide a window into a planet's interior structure and evolution, including its atmospheric and space environments. Satellites at Mars have measured crustal magnetic fields indicating an ancient dynamo. These crustal fields interact with the solar wind to generate transient fields and electric currents in Mars's upper atmosphere. Surface magnetic field data play a key role in understanding these effects and the dynamo. Here we report measurements of magnetic field strength and direction at the InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) landing site on Mars. We find that the field is ten times stronger than predicted by satellite-based models. We infer magnetized rocks beneath the surface, within 150 km of the landing site, consistent with a past dynamo with Earth-like strength. Geological mapping and InSight seismic data suggest that much or all of the magnetization sources are carried in basement rocks, which are at least 3.9 billion years old and are overlain by between 200 m and 10 km of lava flows and modified ancient terrain. Daily variations in the magnetic field indicate contributions from ionospheric currents at 120 km to 180 km altitude. Higher-frequency variations are also observed; their origin is unknown, but they probably propagate from even higher altitudes to the surface. We propose that the time-varying fields can be used to investigate the electrical conductivity structure of the martian interior.

Constraints on the shallow elastic and anelastic structure of Mars from InSight seismic data	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							RECEIVER FUNCTIONS; SINGLE-STATION; MISSION; NOISE; INVERSION; WAVES; DECONVOLUTION; ATTENUATION; ALGORITHM; MODEL	The crust beneath the InSight lander on Mars is altered or fractured to 8-11 km depth and may bear volatiles, according to an analysis of seismic noise and wave scattering recorded by InSight's seismometer. Mars's seismic activity and noise have been monitored since January 2019 by the seismometer of the InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) lander. At night, Mars is extremely quiet; seismic noise is about 500 times lower than Earth's microseismic noise at periods between 4 s and 30 s. The recorded seismic noise increases during the day due to ground deformations induced by convective atmospheric vortices and ground-transferred wind-generated lander noise. Here we constrain properties of the crust beneath InSight, using signals from atmospheric vortices and from the hammering of InSight's Heat Flow and Physical Properties (HP3) instrument, as well as the three largest Marsquakes detected as of September 2019. From receiver function analysis, we infer that the uppermost 8-11 km of the crust is highly altered and/or fractured. We measure the crustal diffusivity and intrinsic attenuation using multiscattering analysis and find that seismic attenuation is about three times larger than on the Moon, which suggests that the crust contains small amounts of volatiles.

This article describes the rotational detections of two laser-volatilized salts, NaCl and KCl, made with a miniature Fourier transform millimeter-wave (FTmmW) cavity spectrometer that could one day be used to measure solid composition in the field or in space. The two salts are relevant targets for icy moons in the outer solar system, and in principle, other molecular solids could be analyzed with the FTmmW instrument. By coupling the spectrometer to a collisionally cooling laser ablation source, (a) we demonstrate that the FTmmW instrument is sensitive enough to detect ablation products, and (b) we use the small size of the FTmmW cavity to measure ablation product signal along the carrier gas beam. We find that for 532 nm nanosecond pulses, ablated molecules are widely dispersed in the carrier-gas jet. In addition to the miniature spectrometer results, we present several complementary measurements intended to characterize the laser ablation process. For pulse energies between 10 and 30 mJ, the ablation product yield increases linearly, reaching approximately 10(12) salt molecules per 30 mJ pulse. Using mass spectrometry, we observe Li+ , Na+, and K+ in the plumes of ablated NaCl, KCl, and LiCl, which implies dissociation of the volatilized material. We do not observe salt ions (e.g., NaCl+). However, with 800 nm femtosecond laser pulses, the triatomic ion clusters Li2Cl+, Na2Cl+, and K2Cl+ are produced. Finally, we observe incomplete volatilization with the nanosecond pulses: some of the ejecta are liquid droplets. The insights about ablation plume physics gleaned from these experiments should guide future implementations of the laser-volatilization technique.

Here we present new data sets based on merging several individual satellite data products in order to generate consistent long-term climate data records (CDRs) of these two Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). These ECV CDRs, which cover the time period 2003-2018, have been generated using an ensemble of data products from the satellite sensors SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and (for XCO2) for the first time also including data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. Two types of products have been generated: (i) Level 2 (L2) products generated with the latest version of the ensemble median algorithm (EMMA) and (ii) Level 3 (L3) products obtained by gridding the corresponding L2 EMMA products to obtain a monthly 5 degrees x 5 degrees data product in Obs4MIPs (Observations for Model Inter-comparisons Project) format. The L2 products consist of daily NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files, which contain in addition to the main parameters, i.e., XCO2 or XCH4, corresponding uncertainty estimates for random and potential systematic uncertainties and the averaging kernel for each single (quality-filtered) satellite observation. We describe the algorithms used to generate these data products and present quality assessment results based on comparisons with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TC-CON) ground-based retrievals. We found that the XCO2 Level 2 data set at the TCCON validation sites can be characterized by the following figures of merit (the corresponding values for the Level 3 product are listed in brackets) single-observation random error (1 sigma): 1.29 ppm (monthly: 1.18 ppm); global bias: 0.20 ppm (0.18 ppm); and spatiotemporal bias or relative accuracy (1 sigma): 0.66 ppm (0.70 ppm). The corresponding values for the XCH4 products are single-observation random error (1 sigma): 17.4 ppb (monthly: 8.7 ppb); global bias: 2.0 ppb (2.9 ppb); and spatiotemporal bias (1 sigma): 5.0 ppb (4.9 ppb). It has also been found that the data products exhibit very good long-term stability as no significant long-term bias trend has been identified. The new data sets have also been used to derive annual XCO2 and XCH4 growth rates, which are in reasonable to good agreement with growth rates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) based on marine surface observations.

Design and Performance of the First BICEP Array Receiver	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmology; B-mode polarization; Inflation; CMB; BICEP Array		Branches of cosmic inflationary models, such as slow-roll inflation, predict a background of primordial gravitational waves that imprints a unique odd-parity "B-mode" pattern in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at amplitudes that are within experimental reach. The BICEP/Keck (BK) experiment targets this primordial signature, the amplitude of which is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, by observing the polarized microwave sky through the exceptionally clean and stable atmosphere at the South Pole. B-mode measurements require an instrument with exquisite sensitivity, tight control of systematics, and wide frequency coverage to disentangle the primordial signal from the Galactic foregrounds. BICEP Array represents the most recent stage of the BK program and comprises four BICEP3-class receivers observing at 30/40, 95, 150 and 220/270 GHz. The 30/40 GHz receiver will be deployed at the South Pole during the 2019/2020 austral summer. After 3 full years of observations with 30,000+ detectors, BICEP Array will measure primordial gravitational waves to a precision sigma(r) between 0.002 and 0.004, depending on foreground complexity and the degree of lensing removal. In this paper, we give an overview of the instrument, highlighting the design features in terms of cryogenics, magnetic shielding, detectors and readout architecture as well as reporting on the integration and tests that are ongoing with the first receiver at 30/40 GHz.

Location Forest ecosystems in Europe from 11 degrees W to 36 degrees E and 29.5 degrees N to 62 degrees N. Taxon Pinaceae, Fagaceae and Betulaceae, Oleaceae, Tiliaceae, Aceraceae, Leguminosae (unspecific). Methods We adopted the existing Dynamic Global Vegetation Model Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land of flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) for Europe by eliminating both bioclimatic limits of plant functional types (PFTs) and replacing prescribed values of functional traits for PFTs with emergent values under influence of environmental filtering and competition. We quantified functional richness (FR), functional divergence (FDv) and functional evenness (FE) in representative selected sites and at Pan-European scale resulting from simulated functional and structural trait combinations of individual trees. While FR quantifies the amount of occupied trait space, FDv and FE describe the distribution and abundance of trait combinations, respectively, in a multidimensional trait space. Results Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land of flexible individual traits reproduces spatial PFTs and local trait distributions and agrees well with observed productivity, biomass and tree height of European natural forests. The observed site-specific trait distributions and spatial gradients of traits of the leaf- and stem-resource economics spectra coincide with environmental filtering and the competition for light and water in environments with strong abiotic stress. Where deciduous and needle-leaved trees co-occur, for example, in boreal and mountainous forests, the potential niche space is wide (high FR), and extreme ends in the niche space are occupied (high FDv). We find high FDv in Mediterranean forests where drought increasingly limits tree growth, thus niche differentiation becomes more important. FDv decreases in temperate forests where a cold climate increasingly limits growth efficiency of broad-leaved summer green trees, thus reducing the importance of competitive exclusion. Highest FE was simulated in wet Atlantic and southern Europe which indicated relatively even niche occupation and thus high resource-use efficiency. Main Conclusions We find FD resulting from both environmental and competitive filtering. Pan-European FR, FDv and FE demonstrate the influence of climate gradients and intra- and inter-PFT competition. The indices underline a generally high FD of natural forests in Europe. Co-existence of functionally diverse trees across PFTs emerges from alternative (life-history) strategies, disturbance and tree demography.

However, upscaling of site-level CH4 observations across diverse Arctic landscapes remains highly uncertain, compromising accuracy of current pan-Arctic CH4 budgets and confidence in model forecasts. We report a 30,000-km(2) survey at 25-m(2) resolution (similar to 1 billion observations) of CH4 hotspot patterns across Alaska and northwestern Canada using airborne imaging spectroscopy. Hotspots covered 0.2% of the surveyed area, concentrated in the wetland-upland ecotone, and followed a two-component power law as a function of distance from standing water. Hotspots decreased sharply over the first 40 m from standing water (y = 0.21 x(-0.649), R-2 = 0.97), mirroring in situ flux observations. Beyond 40 m, CH4 hotspots diminished gradually over hundreds of meters (y = 0.004 x(-0.164), R-2 = 0.99). This emergent property quantifies the distribution of strong methanogenic zones from site to regional scales, vastly improving metrics for scaling ground-based CH4 inventories and validation of land models.

Martian Thermospheric Warming Associated With the Planet Encircling Dust Event of 2018	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MARS; VARIABILITY; IONOSPHERE; TRENDS	We report the first observations of Martian thermospheric warming associated with the Planet Encircling Dust Event (PEDE) of 2018. We used dayglow observations made by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument aboard the MAVEN spacecraft to retrieve the upper atmosphere temperature structures. Our analysis shows that the two-cell meridional circulation pattern may be operating before the PEDE-2018, which resulted in the cooling of lower/middle latitudes and warming at higher latitudes. However, after the onset, the existing circulation pattern gets dampened, resulted in a weaker latitudinal temperature structure. We saw that mean temperatures rose by about 20 K for the same local time after the onset of the dust storm. Our 3-D Mars General Ionosphere Thermosphere Model calculations were able to reproduce the temperatures during the predust and early dust storm but failed to fully capture the temperature trend during the growth phase of the PEDE of 2018.

Replacing GRACE/GRACE-FO C-30 With Satellite Laser Ranging: Impacts on Antarctic Ice Sheet Mass Change	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GRACE; GRAVITY	Satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations have long been relied upon for measuring changes in Earth's dynamic oblateness, C-20. This major component of Earth's time-variable gravity field is not well observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions, leading to the common practice of replacing their values with those obtained by SLR. The C-30 coefficient, which has a large impact on the recovered Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes, is shown here to be poorly observed by GRACE/GRACE-FO when either mission is operating without two fully functional accelerometers. The GRACE spacecraft pair operated nominally until October 2016 when one accelerometer was powered off due to battery limitations, while GRACE-FO is currently excluding one accelerometer from the data processing due to elevated noise levels. Beginning with the launch of Laser Relativity Satellite in 2012, SLR-derived C-30 values are suitable for replacing any problematic GRACE/GRACE-FO estimates, enabling the accurate recovery of Antarctic Ice Sheet mass changes, among others.

This is often ignored in methane flux inversions, and the impacts of neglecting interactive chemistry have not been quantified. Using a coupled-chemistry box model, we show that neglecting the effect of methane source perturbation on [OH] can lead to a 25% bias in estimating abrupt changes in methane sources after only 10 years. Further, large CO emissions, such as from biomass burning, can increase methane concentrations by extending the methane lifetime through impacts on [OH]. Finally, we quantify the biases of including (or excluding) coupled chemistry in the context of recent methane and CO trends. Decreasing CO concentrations, beginning in the 2000's, have notable impacts on methane flux inversions. Given these nonnegligible errors, decadal methane emissions inversions should incorporate chemical feedbacks for more robust methane trend analyses and source attributions.

Observed Tightening of Tropical Ascent in Recent Decades and Linkage to Regional Precipitation Changes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							HADLEY CIRCULATION; CLIMATE; CMIP5; MODELS	Climate models predict that the tropical ascending region should tighten under global warming, but observational quantification of the tightening rate is limited. Here we show that the observed spatial extent of the relatively moist, rainy and cloudy regions in the tropics associated with large-scale ascent has been decreasing at a rate of -1%/decade (-5%/K) from 1979 to 2016, resulting from combined effects of interdecadal variability and anthropogenic forcings, with the former contributing more than the latter. The tightening of tropical ascent is associated with an increase in the occurrence frequency of extremely strong ascent, leading to an increase in the average precipitation rate in the top 1% of monthly rainfall in the tropics. At the margins of the convective zones such as the Southeast Amazonia region, the contraction of large-scale ascent is related to a long-term drying trend about -3.2%/decade in the past 38 years.

Advective Fluxes in the Martian Regolith as a Mechanism Driving Methane and Other Trace Gas Emissions to the Atmosphere	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GALE CRATER; CONTAMINANT TRANSPORT; THERMAL TIDES; POROUS-MEDIA; MARS; ORIGIN; PRESSURE	Advective fluxes influence methane and CO2 soil emissions into the atmosphere on Earth and may drive trace gas emissions in the Mars atmosphere. However, their relevance in the Martian regolith has not been evaluated to date. Our regolith transport simulations show that advective fluxes can be relevant under Martian conditions and may drive the methane abundance detected by Mars Science Laboratory. Trace gas emissions would be highest in regions where winds interact with topography. Emissions in these regions may be further enhanced by time-varying pressure fields produced by diurnal thermal tides and atmospheric turbulence. Trace gases such as methane should be emitted or produced from the first layers of regolith, or quickly transported to this region from a deeper reservoir through fractured media.

In the 1960s, tracking anomalies during the Ranger VII and VIII lunar missions were traced to errors in the Earth orientation parameters. As a result, Earth orientation calibration methods were improved to support the Mariner IV and V planetary missions. Today, accurate Earth orientation parameters are used to track and navigate every interplanetary spaceflight mission. The approach taken at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) to provide the interplanetary spacecraft tracking and navigation teams with the UT1 and polar motion parameters that they need is based upon the use of a Kalman filter to combine past measurements of these parameters and predict their future evolution. A model was then used to provide the nutation/precession components of the Earth's orientation. As a result, variations caused by the free core nutation were not taken into account. But for the highest accuracy, these variations must be considered. So JPL recently developed an approach based upon the use of a Kalman filter and smoother to provide smoothed and predicted celestial pole offsets (CPOs) to the interplanetary spacecraft tracking and navigation teams. The approach used at JPL to do this and an evaluation of the accuracy of the predicted CPOs is given here. For assessing the quality of JPL's nutation predictions, we compare the time series of dX, dY provided by JPL with the predictions obtained from the IERS Rapid Service/Prediction Centre. Our results confirmed that the approach recently developed by JPL can be used for the successful nutation prediction. In particular, we show that after 90 days of prediction, the estimated errors are 43% lower for dX and 33% lower for dY than in the case of the official IERS products, and an average improvement is 19% and 22% for dX and dY, respectively.

We contextualize the TRF determination in the state-space framework and we emphasize connections between frame state, its observability through space-geodetic frame inputs and the similarity transformation which is central to frame definition. We elaborate on the notion of sub-secular frame, enabled by our approach, in constrast to standard TRF products which, secular by construction, are designed to represent the long-term mean physical properties of the frame. Comparisons of JTRF solutions to standard products such as the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) suggest high-level consistency in a long-term sense with time derivatives of the Helmert transformation parameters connecting the two TRFs below 0.18 mm/yr. We discuss advantages and limitations of JPL approach to TRF determination and outline lines of inquiries that are currently being researched as part of JTRF development plan. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

High temperature primary battery for Venus surface missions	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						High temperature; Battery; Venus; FeS; LiCl-KCl; LiAl	FES2 CATHODE MATERIAL; TECHNOLOGY; IRON	The hostile environment of high temperature and CO2 pressure has limited previous Venus surface mission durations to less than 2 h giving only a glimpse of the Venus surface, despite the use of considerable insulation, phase-change materials, and similar heat sinks to isolate the payload and avionics from high surface tempera. tures. NASA has initiated studies to develop new power technologies that can tolerate the high Venus surface temperature of 465 degrees C and pressure of 92 bar, and operate for future long-duration Venus landers and probes. Such in-stns investigations are crucial to gather basic information on the crust, mantle, core, and bulk composition of Venus for understanding the evolutionary paths of Venus in relation to Earth. In this paper, we describe the development of high temperature primary batteries based on lithium alloy anodes, transition metal sulfide cathodes, and molten salt electrolytes. Among the various cathode materials examined for thermal stability and for electrochemical activity, FeS has emerged as the most suitable cathode. With optimized cell components, cell design, and operational parameters, laboratory test cells were fabricated, which demonstrated continuous operation of similar to 26 days at 475 degrees C. These batteries will enable new long-duration surface missions for detailed surface exploration of Venus.

Implementation of commercial Li-ion cells on the MarCO deep space CubeSats	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						CubeSats; Li-ion cells; Mars mission; COTS cells; Panasonic 18650 cells; Lander EDL	LITHIUM BATTERIES	In NASA's first technology demonstration of CubeSats in deep space, MarCO-A and MarCO-B were launched with the Mars InSight mission. These CubeSats successfully transmitted the InSight lander's entry, descent, and landing telemetry back to Earth in near-real time, which was not possible with existing Mars orbital data relay systems. In addition to solar arrays, each MarCO CubeSat was powered by a 3S4P battery comprising 18650-size lithium-ion cells. These commercial lithium-ion cells (Panasonic NCR18650B) were screened and matched using a cell selection process that was simplified relative to larger missions, to ensure safe and reliable battery behavior at an acceptable cost. This paper describes the design of the MarCO power system and battery, the lithium-ion battery cell testing and screening processes and results, and initial performance data from MarCO flight telemetry.

Both phases have an identical Si:As ratio of 1:2 providing insight on how layers of the parent phase SiAs2 accommodate excess electrons from Li cations to form Si-As anionic frameworks. LiSi3As6 exhibits a variety of bonding schemes involving Si-Si and As-As bonds, as well as corner-sharing SiAs4 tetrahedra, while Li2SiAs2 is isostructural to the previously reported Li2SiP2, with adamantane-like Si4As10 units connected into 3D framework. LiSi3As6 and Li2SiAs2 are predicted to be indirect semiconductors which was experimentally confirmed by optical properties characterization. Li2SiAs2 exhibits low thermal conductivity of 1.20 W m(-1) K-1 at 300 K in combination with a room temperature ionic conductivity of 7 x 10(-6) S cm(-1), an order of magnitude greater than that of the phosphide and nitride analogues, indicating its potential as a solid-state Li-ion conductor.

Extending KIDs to the Mid-IR for Future Space and Suborbital Observatories	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Kinetic inductance detector; 10 micron; Mid-infrared; Far-infrared; Astrophysics		The galaxy evolution probe (GEP) is a concept for a probe-class space observatory to study the physical processes related to star formation over cosmic time. To do so, the mid- and far-infrared (IR) spectra of galaxies must be studied. These mid- and far-IR observations require large multi-frequency arrays, sensitive detectors. Our goal is to develop low NEP aluminum kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) for wavelengths of 10-400 mu m for the GEP and a pathfinder long-duration balloon (GEPB) that will perform precursor GEP science. KIDs for the lower wavelength range (10-100 mu m) have not been previously implemented. We present an absorber design for KIDs sensitive to wavelengths of 10 mu m shown to have around 75-80% absorption efficiency through ANSYS HFSS (high-frequency structure simulator) simulations, challenges that come with optimizing our design to increase the wavelength range, initial tests on our design of fabricated 10 mu m KIDs, and theoretical NEP calculations.

Projecting Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise from basal ice shelf melt using linear response functions of 16 ice sheet models (LARMIP-2)	EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article							SURFACE MASS-BALANCE; GROUNDING LINE; PINE ISLAND; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; RETREAT DRIVEN; CLIMATE; FLOW; GREENLAND; SYSTEM	The sea level contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet constitutes a large uncertainty in future sea level projections. Here we apply a linear response theory approach to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models to estimate the Antarctic ice sheet contribution from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century. The purpose of this computation is to estimate the uncertainty of Antarctica's future contribution to global sea level rise that arises from large uncertainty in the oceanic forcing and the associated ice shelf melting. Ice shelf melting is considered to be a major if not the largest perturbation of the ice sheet's flow into the ocean. However, by computing only the sea level contribution in response to ice shelf melting, our study is neglecting a number of processes such as surface-mass-balance-related contributions. In assuming linear response theory, we are able to capture complex temporal responses of the ice sheets, but we neglect any self-dampening or self-amplifying processes. This is particularly relevant in situations in which an instability is dominating the ice loss. The results obtained here are thus relevant, in particular wherever the ice loss is dominated by the forcing as opposed to an internal instability, for example in strong ocean warming scenarios. In order to allow for comparison the methodology was chosen to be exactly the same as in an earlier study (Levermann et al., 2014) but with 16 instead of 5 ice sheet models. We include uncertainty in the atmospheric warming response to carbon emissions (full range of CMIP5 climate model sensitivities), uncertainty in the oceanic transport to the Southern Ocean (obtained from the time-delayed and scaled oceanic subsurface warming in CMIP5 models in relation to the global mean surface warming), and the observed range of responses of basal ice shelf melting to oceanic warming outside the ice shelf cavity. This uncertainty in basal ice shelf melting is then convoluted with the linear response functions of each of the 16 ice sheet models to obtain the ice flow response to the individual global warming path. The model median for the observational period from 1992 to 2017 of the ice loss due to basal ice shelf melting is 10.2 mm, with a likely range between 5.2 and 21.3 mm For the same period the Antarctic ice sheet lost mass equivalent to 7.4 mm of global sea level rise, with a standard deviation of 3.7 mm (Shepherd et al., 2018) including all processes, especially surface-mass-balance changes. For the unabated warming path, Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), we obtain a median contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global mean sea level rise from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century of 17 cm, with a likely range (66th percentile around the mean) between 9 and 36 cm and a very likely range (90th percentile around the mean) between 6 and 58 cm. For the RCP2.6 warming path, which will keep the global mean temperature below 2 degrees C of global warming and is thus consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement, the procedure yields a median of 13 cm of global mean sea level contribution. The likely range for the RCP2.6 scenario is between 7 and 24 cm, and the very likely range is between 4 and 37 cm. The structural uncertainties in the method do not allow for an interpretation of any higher uncertainty percentiles. We provide projections for the five Antarctic regions and for each model and each scenario separately. The rate of sea level contribution is highest under the RCP8.5 scenario. The maximum within the 21st century of the median value is 4 cm per decade, with a likely range between 2 and 9 cm per decade and a very likely range between 1 and 14 cm per decade.

Thermal Simulations of Temperature Excursions on the Athena X-IFU Detector Wafer from Impacts by Cosmic Rays	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic ray; Particle interactions; X-ray; Systematic effects		We present the design and implementation of a thermal model, developed in COMSOL, aiming to probe the wafer-scale thermal response arising from realistic rates and energies of cosmic rays at L2 impacting the detector wafer of Athena X-IFU. The wafer thermal model is a four-layer 2D model, where two layers represent the constituent materials (Si bulk and Si3N4 membrane) and two layers represent the Au metallization layer's phonon and electron temperatures. We base the simulation geometry on the current specifications for the X-IFU detector wafer and simulate cosmic ray impacts using a simple power injection into the Si bulk. We measure the temperature at the point of the instrument's most central TES detector. By probing the response of the system and pulse characteristics as a function of the thermal input energy and location, we reconstruct cosmic ray pulses in Python. By utilizing this code, along with the results of the GEANT4 simulations produced for X-IFU, we produce realistic time-ordered data (TOD) of the temperature seen by the central TES, which we use to simulate the degradation of the energy resolution of the instrument in space-like conditions on this wafer. We find a degradation to the energy resolution of 7 keV X-rays of approximate to 0.04 eV. By modifying wafer parameters and comparing the simulated TOD, this study is a valuable tool for probing design changes on the thermal background seen by the detectors.	[Stever, S.

Response of middle atmospheric temperature to the 27 d solar cycle: an analysis of 13 years of microwave limb sounder data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							INDUCED 27-DAY VARIATIONS; ULTRAVIOLET VARIATIONS; MESOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE; AIM SOFIE; TERM; VARIABILITY; OZONE; FLUX	This work focuses on studying the presence and characteristics of 27 d solar signatures in middle atmospheric temperature observed by the microwave limb sounder (MLS) on NASA's Aura spacecraft. The 27 d signatures in temperature are extracted using the superposed epoch analysis (SEA) technique. We use time-lagged linear regression (sensitivity analysis) and a Monte Carlo test method (significance test) to explore the dependence of the results on latitude and altitude, solar activity, and season, as well as on different parameters (e.g., smoothing filter, window width and epoch centers). Using different parameters does impact the results to a certain degree, but it does not affect the overall results. Analyzing the 13-year data set shows that highly significant 27 d solar signatures in middle atmospheric temperature are present at many altitudes and latitudes. A tendency to higher temperature sensitivity to solar forcing in the winter hemisphere compared to the summer hemisphere is found. In addition, the sensitivity of temperature to 27 d solar forcing tends to be larger at high latitudes than at low latitudes. For 11-year solar minimum conditions no statistically significant identification of a 27 d solar signature is possible at most altitudes and latitudes. Several results we obtained suggest that processes other than solar variability drive atmospheric temperature variability at periods around 27 d. Comparisons of the obtained sensitivity values with earlier experimental and model studies show good overall agreement.

The coupling between the conservation equations and the equation of state is examined here in order to highlight the existing challenges in performing accurate numerical simulations at high-pressure conditions. The multi-species mass fluxes and the heat flux contained in the conservation equations are those derived from fundamental physics and incorporate transport properties computed using models valid at high-pressure situations. The intricacies in evaluating results obtained from the corresponding simulations with experimental data are addressed. The numerical approaches that stem from either lack of experimental initial condition information or from differences between the experimental configuration versus the simulation configuration are discussed. Experimental difficulties are also addressed, particularly those related to obtaining meaningful data to discriminate between high-pressure models and atmospheric-pressure models.

Monitoring Urban Greenhouse Gases Using Open-Path Fourier Transform Spectroscopy	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN			English	Article						remote sensing; Open-Path Fourier Transform spectroscopy; greenhouse gases; urban emissions	LOS-ANGELES MEGACITY; TRACE-GAS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; METHANE EMISSIONS; NITROUS-OXIDE; TOP-DOWN; CALIBRATION; POLLUTANTS; INVERSION	Urban areas are large sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. Measurements of atmospheric GHGs in urban areas provide information on these emissions, which can complement bottom-up estimates. Here, we present an Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy system for GHG monitoring in Toronto, Canada. We describe the installation of the OP-FTIR and retrieval of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, and H2O dry-air mole fractions and delta D over a two-way atmospheric open path of approximately 320 m using non-linear least squares fitting. The OP-FTIR measurements of CO2, CO, and CH4 are then calibrated using measurements from two Picarro GHG Cavity Ringdown Spectrometers deployed at both ends of the system. Our results show that retrieved dry-air mole fractions of CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O are sensitive to urban emissions from Toronto. In addition, CH4 measurements are influenced by a localized source southwest of the observing system, presumably a natural gas leak, and N2O measurements are influenced by an undetermined source to the northeast of the OP-FTIR. By performing comparisons with measurements from an in situ detector 5.4 km south of the OP-FTIR system, it is demonstrated that the diurnal gradients in CO2 and CO between these sites are enhanced for weekdays relative to weekends, consistent with bottom-up emission inventories. Emissions of CO2 and CO are then calculated from the gradients between the sites. The emissions are found to be consistent with bottom-up estimates but are too imprecise to further refine the bottom-up inventories.

Many of these relate to the modeling, detection, and characterization of signals from binary inspirals with an extreme component-mass ratio of less than or similar to 10(-4). In this paper, we draw attention to the issue of systematic error in parameter estimation due to the use of fast but approximate waveform models; this is found to be relevant for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals even in the case of waveforms with greater than or similar to 90% overlap accuracy and moderate (greater than or similar to 30) signal-to-noise ratios. A scheme that uses Gaussian processes to interpolate and marginalize over waveform error is adapted and investigated as a possible precursor solution to this problem. Several new methodological results are obtained, and the viability of the technique is successfully demonstrated on a three-parameter example in the setting of the LISA Data Challenge.

Photometric imaging with the solar gravitational lens	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We discuss the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL). We estimate the power of the EM field received by an imaging telescope. Studying the behavior of the EM field at the photometric detector, we develop expressions that describe the received power from a point source as well as from an extended resolved source. We model the source as a disk with uniform surface brightness and study the contribution of blur to a particular image pixel. To describe this process, we develop expressions describing the power received from the directly imaged region of the exoplanet, from the rest of the exoplanet and also the power for off-image pointing. We study the SGL's amplification and its angular resolution in the case of observing an extended source with a modest size telescope. The results can be applied to direct imaging of exoplanets using the SGL.

The Galactic plane has been observed extensively by a large number of Galactic plane surveys from infrared to radio wavelengths at an angular resolution below 40. However, a 21 cm line and continuum survey with comparable spatial resolution is lacking.Aims. The first half of THOR data (l = 14.0 degrees-37.9 degrees, and l = 47.1 degrees-51.2 degrees, |b|<= 1.25 degrees) has been published in our data release 1 paper. With this data release 2 paper, we publish all the remaining spectral line data and Stokes I continuum data with high angular resolution (10 '-40 ''), including a new HI dataset for the whole THOR survey region (l = 14.0-67.4 degrees and |b|<= 1.25 degrees). As we published the results of OH lines and continuum emission elsewhere, we concentrate on the HI analysis in this paper.Methods. With the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in C-configuration, we observed a large portion of the first Galactic quadrant, achieving an angular resolution of <= 40 ''. At L Band, the WIDAR correlator at the VLA was set to cover the 21 cm HI line, four OH transitions, a series of Hn alpha radio recombination lines (RRLs; n = 151 to 186), and eight 128 MHz-wide continuum spectral windows, simultaneously.Results. We publish all OH and RRL data from the C-configuration observations, and a new HI dataset combining VLA C+D+GBT (VLA D-configuration and GBT data are from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey) for the whole survey. The HI emission shows clear filamentary substructures at negative velocities with low velocity crowding. The emission at positive velocities is more smeared-out, likely due to higher spatial and velocity crowding of structures at the positive velocities. Compared to the spiral arm model of the Milky Way, the atomic gas follows the Sagittarius and Perseus Arm well, but with significant material in the inter-arm regions. With the C-configuration-only HI+continuum data, we produce an HI optical depth map of the THOR areal coverage from 228 absorption spectra with the nearest-neighbor method. With this tau map, we corrected the HI emission for optical depth, and the derived column density is 38% higher than the column density with optically thin assumption. The total HI mass with optical depth correction in the survey region is 4.7 x 10(8) M-circle dot, 31% more than the mass derived assuming the emission is optically thin. If we applied this 31% correction to the whole Milky Way, the total atomic gas mass would be 9.4-10.5 x 10(9) M-circle dot. Comparing the HI with existing CO data, we find a significant increase in the atomic-to-molecular gas ratio from the spiral arms to the inter-arm regions.Conclusions. The high-sensitivity and resolution THOR HI dataset provides an important new window on the physical and kinematic properties of gas in the inner Galaxy. Although the optical depth we derive is a lower limit, our study shows that the optical depth correction issignificant for HI column density and mass estimation. Together with the OH, RRL and continuum emission from the THOR survey, these new HI data provide the basis for high-angular-resolution studies of the interstellar medium in different phases.

J	de Putter, R; Dore, O				de Putter, Roland; Dore, Olivier			In search of an observational quantum signature of the primordial perturbations in slow-roll and ultraslow-roll inflation	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							TO-CLASSICAL TRANSITION; COSMOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS; DENSITY PERTURBATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; STATES	In the standard inflationary paradigm, cosmological density perturbations are generated as quantum fluctuations in the early Universe, but then undergo a quantum-to-classical transition. A key role in this transition is played by squeezing of the quantum state, which is a result of the strong suppression of the decaying mode component of the perturbations. Motivated by ever improving measurements of the cosmological perturbations, we ask whether there are scenarios where this decaying mode is nevertheless still observable in the late Universe, ideally leading to a "smoking gun" signature of the quantum nature of the perturbations. We address this question by evolving the quantum state of the perturbations from inflation into the postinflationary Universe. After recovering the standard result that in slow-roll (SR) inflation the decaying mode is indeed hopelessly suppressed by the time the perturbations are observed (by similar to 115 orders of magnitude), we turn to ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation, a scenario in which the usual decaying mode actually grows on superhorizon scales. Despite this drastic difference in the behavior of the mode functions, we find also in USR that the late-Universe decaying mode amplitude is dramatically suppressed, in fact by the same similar to 115 orders of magnitude. We finally explain that this large suppression is a general result that holds beyond the SR and USR scenarios considered and follows from a modified version of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the observed amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. The classical behavior of the perturbations is thus closely related to the classical behavior of macroscopic objects drawing an analogy with the position of a massive particle, the curvature perturbations today have an enormous effective mass of order m(pl)(2)/H-2(0) similar to 10(120), making them highly classical.

This RF-only capability is predicated on novel techniques for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) identification and mitigation with an analysis efficiency of approximately 45% for shower-driven events with a Signal-to-noise ratio. 5 against the galactic background noise power of individual antennas. Radio self-triggering enables more efficient detection of cosmic rays over a wider range of zenith angles than possible via triggers from in-situ particle detectors and the method presented here can be easily adapted to neutrino experiments relying on RF-only detection. This paper discusses the system design, RFI characterization and mitigation techniques, and initial results from 10 cosmic ray candidate events identified within a 40-hour observing window. A design for a future optimized commensal cosmic-ray detector for the OVRO-LWA is presented, as well as recommendations for developing a similar capability for other experiments - these designs either reduce data-rate or increase sensitivity by an order of magnitude for many configurations of radio instruments.

Although filaments are widely observed toward Galactic star-forming regions, the exact role of filaments in star formation is unclear. Studies toward low-mass star-forming regions revealed both preferred and random orientations of outflows with respect to the filament long axes, while outflows in massive star-forming regions are mostly oriented perpendicular to the host filaments and parallel to the magnetic fields at similar physical scales. Here, we explore outflows in a sample of 11 protoclusters in H II regions, a more evolved stage compared to infared dark clouds, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO (3-2) line observations. We identify a total of 105 outflow lobes in these protoclusters. Among the 11 targets, 7 are embedded within parsec-scale filamentary structures detected in (CO)-C-13 line and 870 mu m continuum emissions. The angles between outflow axes and corresponding filaments (gamma(Fil)) do not show any hint of preferred orientations (i.e., orthogonal or parallel as inferred in numerical models) with respect to the position angle of the filaments. Identified outflow lobes are also not correlated with the magnetic fields and Galactic plane position angles. Outflows associated with filaments aligned along the large-scale magnetic fields are also randomly oriented. Our study presents the first statistical results of outflow orientation with respect to large-scale filaments and magnetic fields in evolved massive star-forming regions. The random distribution suggests a lack of alignment of outflows with filaments, which may be a result of the evolutionary stage of the clusters.

Dose Deposition	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; RADIATION; PROTON; EVOLUTION; NITROGEN; DUST; IONIZATION; SURFACE; CARBON; MODEL	Comets are small bodies thought to contain the most pristine material in the solar system. However, since their formation approximate to 4.5 Gy ago, they have been altered by different processes. While not exposed to much electromagnetic radiation, they experience intense particle radiation. Galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles have a broad spectrum of energies and interact with the cometary surface and subsurface; they are the main source of space weathering for a comet in the Kuiper Belt or in the Oort Cloud, and also affect the ice prior to the comet agglomeration. While low-energy particles interact only with the cometary surface, the most energetic ones deposit a significant amount of energy down to tens of meters. This interaction can modify the isotopic ratios in cometary ices and create secondary compounds through radiolysis, such as O-2 and H2O2 (Paper II). In this paper, we model the energy deposition of energetic particles as a function of depth using a Geant4 application modified to account for the isotope creation process. We quantify the energy deposited in cometary nucleus by galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles. The consequences of the energy deposition on the isotopic and chemical composition of cometary ices and their implication on the interpretation of cometary observations, notably of 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko by the ESA Rosetta spacecraft, will be discussed in Paper II.

Here we introduce the latest version of the MISR aerosol products. The level 2 (swath) product, which is reported on a 4.4 km spatial grid, is designated as version 23 (V23) and contains retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol particle property information derived from MISR's multi-angle observations over both land and water. The changes from the previous version of the algorithm (V22) have significant impacts on the data product and its interpretation. The V23 data set is created from two separate retrieval algorithms that are applied over dark water and land surfaces, respectively. Besides increasing the horizontal resolution to 4.4 km compared with the coarser 17.6m resolution in V22 and streamlining the format and content, the V23 product has added geolocation information, pixel-level uncertainty estimates, and improved cloud screening. MISR data can be obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Science Data Center at https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/misr_table (last access: 11 October 2019). The version number for the V23 level 2 aerosol product is F13_0023. The level 3 (gridded) aerosol product is still reported at 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees spatial resolution with results aggregated from the higher-resolution level 2 data. The format and content at level 3 have also been updated to reflect the changes made at level 2. The level 3 product associated with the V23 level 2 product version is designated as F15_0032. Both the level 2 and level 3 products are now provided in NetCDF format.

Asteroid (2) Pallas is the largest main-belt object not yet visited by a spacecraft, making its surface geology largely unknown and limiting our understanding of its origin and collisional evolution. Previous ground-based observational campaigns returned different estimates of its bulk density that are inconsistent with one another, one measurement(1) being compatible within error bars with the icy Ceres (2.16 +/- 0.01 g cm(-3))(2) and the other(3) compatible within error bars with the rocky Vesta (3.46 +/- 0.03 g cm(-3))(4). Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of Pallas performed with the extreme adaptive optics-fed SPHERE imager(5) on the Very Large Telescope. Pallas records a violent collisional history, with numerous craters larger than 30 km in diameter populating its surface and two large impact basins that could be related to a family-forming impact. Monte Carlo simulations of the collisional evolution of the main belt correlate this cratering record to the high average impact velocity of similar to 11.5 km s(-1) on Pallas-compared with an average of similar to 5.8 km s(-1) for the asteroid belt-induced by Pallas's high orbital inclination (i = 34.8 degrees) and orbital eccentricity (e = 0.23). Compositionally, Pallas's derived bulk density of 2.89 +/- 0.08 g cm(-3) (1 sigma uncertainty) is fully compatible with a CM chondrite-like body, as suggested by its spectral reflectance in the 3 mu m wavelength region(6). A bright spot observed on its surface may indicate an enrichment in salts during an early phase of aqueous alteration, compatible with Pallas's relatively high albedo of 12-17% (refs. (7,8)), although alternative origins are conceivable.

Prior to the Juno mission, in situ measurements of Jupiter's water abundance were obtained from the Galileo probe, which dropped into a meteorologically anomalous site. The findings of the Galileo probe were inconclusive because the concentration of water was still increasing when the probe ceased sending data. Here we report on the water abundance in the equatorial region (0 to 4 degrees north latitude), based on data taken at 1.25 to 22 GHz from the Juno microwave radiometer, probing pressures of approximately 0.7 to 30 bar. Because Juno discovered the deep atmosphere to be surprisingly variable as a function of latitude, it remains to confirm whether the equatorial abundance represents Jupiter's global water abundance. The water abundance at the equatorial region is inferred to be 2.5-1.6(-1.6)(+2.2)x10(3) ppm, or 2:7(-1.7)(+2.4) times the elemental ratio of protosolar oxygen to hydrogen (1 sigma uncertainties). If this reflects the global water abundance, the result suggests that the planetesimals that formed Jupiter were unlikely to have been water-rich clathrate hydrates.

The gripper can grasp objects from 10 to 30 cm in size and anchor to flat and curved rocky surfaces (i.e., cliff faces and seamounts). Laboratory results demonstrated an anchoring capability of greater than 450 N on rough rocks in both shear and normal loading directions. Deployment on the Hercules ROV (remotely operated vehicle) aboard the E/V Nautilus on three deep-ocean dives verified performance at depths up to to 2,100 m with approximately 100 N loads applied through the ROV's thrusters, including moment loads. The gripper also serves as a development unit for future robotic tools that will include a coring drill in the center of the gripper, as previously demonstrated in non-ocean environments with microspine grippers. Such a tool will facilitate the collection of geologic samples from the deep ocean using more agile and cost-effective systems.

The campaign took place in October-November 2017 over the western part of the United States. During ACEPOL six different instruments were deployed on the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft, including four multi-angle polarimeters (MAPs): SPEX airborne, the Airborne Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), the Airborne Multi-angle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Also, two lidars participated: the High Spectral Resolution Lidar-2 (HSRL-2) and the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL). Flights were conducted mainly for scenes with low aerosol load over land, but some cases with higher AOD were also observed. We perform aerosol retrievals from SPEX airborne, RSP (410-865 nm range only), and AirMSPI using the SRON aerosol retrieval algorithm and compare the results against AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) and HSRL-2 measurements (for SPEX airborne and RSP). All three MAPs compare well against AERONET for the aerosol optical depth (AOD), with a mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.014 and 0.024 at 440 nm. For the fine-mode effective radius the MAE ranges between 0.021 and 0.028 mu m. For the comparison with HSRL-2 we focus on a day with low AOD (0.02-0.14 at 532 nm) over the California Central Valley, Arizona, and Nevada (26 October) as well as a flight with high AOD (including measurements with AOD > 1:0 at 532 nm) over a prescribed forest fire in Arizona (9 November). For the day with low AOD the MAEs in AOD (at 532 nm) with HSRL-2 are 0.014 and 0.022 for SPEX and RSP, respectively, showing the capability of MAPs to provide accurate AOD retrievals for the challenging case of low AOD over land. For the retrievals over the smoke plume a reasonable agreement in AOD between the MAPs and HSRL-2 was also found (MAE 0.088 and 0.079 for SPEX and RSP, respectively), despite the fact that the comparison is hampered by large spatial variability in AOD throughout the smoke plume. A good comparison is also found between the MAPs and HSRL-2 for the aerosol depolarization ratio (a measure of particle sphericity), with an MAE of 0.023 and 0.016 for SPEX and RSP, respectively. Finally, SPEX and RSP agree very well for the retrieved microphysical and optical properties of the smoke plume.

J	Bau, G; Roa, J				Bau, Giulio; Roa, Javier			Uniform formulation for orbit computation: the intermediate elements	CELESTIAL MECHANICS & DYNAMICAL ASTRONOMY			English	Article						Regularisation; Variation of parameters; Orbit computation	PERTURBATION-THEORY; KEPLERIAN MOTION; UNIVERSAL; VARIABLES; EQUATIONS; PROPAGATION; SET	We present a new method for computing orbits in the perturbed two-body problem: the position and velocity vectors of the propagated object in Cartesian coordinates are replaced by eight orbital elements, i.e. constants of the unperturbed motion. The proposed elements are uniformly valid for any value of the total energy. Their definition stems from the idea of applying Sundman's time transformation in the framework of the projective decomposition of motion, which is the starting point of the Burdet-Ferrandiz linearisation, combined with Stumpff's functions. In analogy with Deprit's ideal elements, the formulation relies on a special reference frame that evolves slowly under the action of external perturbations. We call it the intermediate frame, hence the name of the elements. Two of them are related to the radial motion, and the next four, given by Euler parameters, fix the orientation of the intermediate frame. The total energy and a time element complete the state vector. All the necessary formulae for extending the method to orbit determination and uncertainty propagation are provided. For example, the partial derivatives of the position and velocity with respect to the intermediate elements are obtained explicitly together with the inverse partial derivatives. Numerical tests are included to assess the performance of the proposed special perturbation method when propagating the orbit of comets C/2003 T4 (LINEAR) and C/1985 K1 (Machholz).

A prototypical pogo stick model might mimic a space hopper or a segmented telescope mirror actuator, while an extension of that prototype could simulate the terramechanics problem of a deformable soil model interacting with a penetrator. The inclusion of mem-models, including memristor and memcapacitor models, introduces an increased level of fidelity and a new and effective means of modeling memory effects and path dependence of nonlinear interacting dynamical systems. This challenging class of problems, which involves non-smooth dynamical systems posed as differential-algebraic equations, is formulated here as a hybrid dynamical system with both continuous and discrete states, and a state event location algorithm is successfully applied to track discontinuous changes in the system states.

ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mars; Science operations; Rover; Analog; GHOST field test	MARS; EXPLORATION; STRATEGIES; BASIN; LAKE	We conducted a field test at a potential Mars analog site to provide insight into planning for future robotic missions such as Mars 2020, where science operations must facilitate efficient choice of biologically relevant sampling locations. We compared two data acquisition and decision-making protocols currently used by Mars Science Laboratory: (1) a linear approach, where sites are examined as they are encountered and (2) a walkabout approach, in which the field site is first examined with remote rover instruments to gain an understanding of regional context followed by deployment of time- and power-intensive contact and sampling instruments on a smaller subset of locations. The walkabout method was advantageous in terms of both the time required to execute and a greater confidence in results and interpretations, leading to enhanced ability to tailor follow-on observations to better address key science and sampling goals. This advantage is directly linked to the walkabout method's ability to provide broad geological context earlier in the science analysis process. For Mars 2020, and specifically for small regions to be explored (e.g., <1 km(2)), we recommend that the walkabout approach be considered where possible, to provide early context and time for the science team to develop a coherent suite of hypotheses and robust ways to test them.

Ceres observed at low phase angles by VIR-Dawn	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: Ceres; methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric; radiative transfer; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; planets and satellites: surfaces	ASTEROID OBSERVATIONS; OPPOSITION; PHOTOMETRY; SURFACE; POLARIZATION; REFLECTANCE; DEPENDENCE; POROSITY; MODEL; RINGS	Context. Particulate surfaces exhibit a surge of reflectance at low phase angles, a phenomenon referred to as the opposition effect (OE). Two mechanisms are recognized as responsible for the OE: shadow hiding (SH) and coherent backscattering. The latter is typically characterized by a small angular width of a few degrees at most and according to the theoretical prediction should exhibit wavelength and albedo dependence. Aims. We characterize the OE on the surface of Ceres using Dawn Visible InfraRed mapping spectrometer hyperspectral images at low phase angles. Furthermore, this dataset, coupled with previous observations, allows us to perform a complete spectrophotometric modeling at visual-to-infrared (VIS-IR) wavelengths (0.465-4.05 mu m) in the broad phase angle range approximate to 0 degrees-132 degrees. Methods. We applied Hapke's theory to the average phase curve for Ceres. Disk-resolved properties of the OE were investigated through an empirical model. Results. Across the investigated phase angle interval, Ceres' average phase curve exhibits a smaller back-scattering contribution for increasing wavelengths. This determines a progressive spectral reddening at larger phase angles that we hypothesize as being related to the effect of submicron roughness on the grain surface. In the OE region, the shape of the phase curves is fairly constant across the VIS range and no sharp opposition surge at very small phase angles (alpha < 2 degrees) can be recognized. This would suggest a major contribution from SH to Ceres' OE. Assuming SH as the dominant mechanism, from the OE angular width we infer a high surface porosity (approximate to 0.9), which appears in good qualitative agreement with Ceres' low thermal inertia. Thanks to the OE observations we derive Ceres' VIS-IR geometric albedo with a reference value at 0.55 mu m of 0.098 +/- 0.007. Mapping of the VIS normal albedo and OE angular width across a portion of the surface of Ceres does not reveal a spatial correlation between these quantities, consistent with SH dominating in the alpha = 0 degrees-7 degrees interval. The comparison of Ceres' V-band magnitude curve with that of other asteroids indicates that Ceres' OE is typical of a low-albedo object and compatible with the C-class type.

J	Oh, J; Oh, BL; Lee, KU; Chae, JH; Yun, K				Oh, Jihoon; Oh, Baek-Lok; Lee, Kyong-Uk; Chae, Jeong-Ho; Yun, Kyongsik			Identifying Schizophrenia Using Structural MRI With a Deep Learning Algorithm	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schizophrenia; deep learning; MRI; classification; structural abnormalities	BRAIN VOLUMES; METAANALYSIS; SCHIZCONNECT; DISORDER	Objective Although distinctive structural abnormalities occur in patients with schizophrenia, detecting schizophrenia with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. This study aimed to detect schizophrenia in structural MRI data sets using a trained deep learning algorithm. Method Five public MRI data sets (BrainGluSchi, COBRE, MCICShare, NMorphCH, and NUSDAST) from schizophrenia patients and normal subjects, for a total of 873 structural MRI data sets, were used to train a deep convolutional neural network. Results The deep learning algorithm trained with structural MR images detected schizophrenia in randomly selected images with reliable performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.96). The algorithm could also identify MR images from schizophrenia patients in a previously unencountered data set with an AUC of 0.71 to 0.90. The deep learning algorithm's classification performance degraded to an AUC of 0.71 when a new data set with younger patients and a shorter duration of illness than the training data sets was presented. The brain region contributing the most to the performance of the algorithm was the right temporal area, followed by the right parietal area. Semitrained clinical specialists hardly discriminated schizophrenia patients from healthy controls (AUC: 0.61) in the set of 100 randomly selected brain images. Conclusions The deep learning algorithm showed good performance in detecting schizophrenia and identified relevant structural features from structural brain MRI data; it had an acceptable classification performance in a separate group of patients at an earlier stage of the disease. Deep learning can be used to delineate the structural characteristics of schizophrenia and to provide supplementary diagnostic information in clinical settings.

Reduced European aerosol emissions suppress winter extremes over northern Eurasia	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							ARCTIC SEA-ICE; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; CLOUD INTERACTIONS; CLIMATE; RESPONSES; TRENDS	Winter extreme weather events receive major public attention due to their serious impacts(1), but the dominant factors regulating their interdecadal trends have not been clearly established(2,3). Here, we show that the radiative forcing due to geospatially redistributed anthropogenic aerosols mainly determined the spatial variations of winter extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere during 1970-2005, a unique transition period for global aerosol forcing(4). Over this period, the local Rossby wave activity and extreme events (top 10% in wave amplitude) exhibited marked declining trends at high latitudes, mainly in northern Eurasia. The combination of long-term observational data and a state-of-the-art climate model revealed the unambiguous signature of anthropogenic aerosols on the wintertime jet stream, planetary wave activity and surface temperature variability on interdecadal timescales. In particular, warming due to aerosol reductions in Europe enhanced the meridional temperature gradient on the jet's poleward flank and strengthened the zonal wind, resulting in significant suppression in extreme events over northern Eurasia. These results exemplify how aerosol forcing can impact large-scale extratropical atmospheric dynamics, and illustrate the importance of anthropogenic aerosols and their spatiotemporal variability in assessing the drivers of extreme weather in historical and future climate. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions decreased over North America and Europe but increased over Asia since the 1970s. This caused jet stream winds to shift poleward over the Atlantic, decreasing planetary wave activity and partially inhibiting extreme winter weather over northern Eurasia.

Solar Energetic Particles Produced by a Slow Coronal Mass Ejection at similar to 0.25 au	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							HYDROMAGNETIC WAVE EXCITATION; COSMIC-RAYS; ION-ACCELERATION; INTERPLANETARY ACCELERATION; SHOCK ACCELERATION; FOCUSED TRANSPORT; SUN; DIFFUSION; PROTONS; COEFFICIENTS	We present an analysis of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS circle dot IS observations of similar to 30-300 keV n(-1) ions on 2018 November 11 when PSP was about 0.25 au from the Sun. Five hours before the onset of a solar energetic particle (SEP) event, a coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed by STEREO-A/COR2, which crossed PSP about a day later. No shock was observed locally at PSP, but the CME may have driven a weak shock earlier. The SEP event was dispersive, with higher energy ions arriving before the lower energy ones. Timing suggests the particles originated at the CME when it was at similar to 7.4R(circle dot). SEP intensities increased gradually from their onset over a few hours, reaching a peak, and then decreased gradually before the CME arrived at PSP. The event was weak, having a very soft energy spectrum (-4 to -5 spectral index). The earliest arriving particles were anisotropic, moving outward from the Sun, but later, the distribution was observed to be more isotropic. We present numerical solutions of the Parker transport equation for the transport of 30-300 keV n(-1) ions assuming a source comoving with the CME. Our model agrees well with the observations. The SEP event is consistent with ion acceleration at a weak shock driven briefly by the CME close to the Sun, which later dissipated before arriving at PSP, followed by the transport of ions in the interplanetary magnetic field.

CME-associated Energetic Ions at 0.23 au: Consideration of the Auroral Pressure Cooker Mechanism Operating in the Low Corona as a Possible Energization Process	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; CURRENT REGION; FIELD; MAGNETOSPHERE; CONICS; HE-3; SUN	We draw a comparison between a solar energetic particle event associated with the release of a slow coronal mass ejection close to the Sun, and the energetic particle population produced in high current density field-aligned current structures associated with auroral phenomena in planetary magnetospheres. We suggest that this process is common in CME development and lift off in the corona, and may account for the electron populations that generate Type III radio bursts, as well as for the prompt energetic ion and electron populations typically observed in interplanetary space.

Small, Low-energy, Dispersive Solar Energetic Particle Events Observed by Parker Solar Probe	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; ACCELERATION; WIND; SUN; FLARE; CORONA	The Energetic Particle Instrument-Low Energy (EPI-Lo) experiment has detected several weak, low-energy (similar to 30-300 keV nucleon(-1)) solar energetic particle (SEP) events during its first two closest approaches to the Sun, providing a unique opportunity to explore the sources of low-energy particle acceleration. As part of the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS circle dot IS) suite, EPI-Lo was designed to investigate the physics of energetic particles; however, in the special lowest-energy "time-of-flight only" product used in this study, it also responds to solar photons in a subset of approximately sunward-looking apertures lacking special light-attenuating foils. During the first three perihelia, in a frame rotating with the Sun, PSP undergoes retrograde motion, covering a 17 degrees heliographic longitudinal range three times during the course of the similar to 11-day perihelion passes, permitting a unique spatial and temporal study into the location, correlation, and persistence of previously unmeasurable SEPs. We examine the signatures of these SEPs (during the first PSP perihelion pass only) and the connection to possible solar sources using remote observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), and the ground-based Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). The orientation of the Sun relative to STEREO, SDO, and GONG makes such identifications challenging, but we do have several candidates, including an equatorial coronal hole at a Carrington longitude of similar to 335 degrees. To analyze observations from EPI-Lo, which is a new type of particle instrument, we examine instrumental effects and provide a preliminary separation of the ion signal from the photon background.

Observations of the 2019 April 4 Solar Energetic Particle Event at the Parker Solar Probe	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							HELIUM ABUNDANCE; LARGE-ANGLE; ACCELERATION; MISSION; SURGES; CORONA	A solar energetic particle event was detected by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS circle dot IS) instrument suite on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2019 April 4 when the spacecraft was inside of 0.17 au and less than 1 day before its second perihelion, providing an opportunity to study solar particle acceleration and transport unprecedentedly close to the source. The event was very small, with peak 1 MeV proton intensities of similar to 0.3 particles (cm(2) sr s MeV)(-1), and was undetectable above background levels at energies above 10 MeV or in particle detectors at 1 au. It was strongly anisotropic, with intensities flowing outward from the Sun up to 30 times greater than those flowing inward persisting throughout the event. Temporal association between particle increases and small brightness surges in the extreme-ultraviolet observed by the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, which were also accompanied by type III radio emission seen by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation on PSP, indicates that the source of this event was an active region nearly 80 degrees east of the nominal PSP magnetic footpoint. This suggests that the field lines expanded over a wide longitudinal range between the active region in the photosphere and the corona.	[Leske, R. A.; Cohen, C. M. S.; Cummings, A. C.; Davis, A.

Small, Low-energy, Dispersive Solar Energetic Particle Events Observed byParker Solar Probe	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						The Sun; Interplanetary particle acceleration; Solar energetic particles; Space vehicle instruments; Solar flares; Michelson interferometers; Solar extreme ultraviolet emission; Solar filament eruptions; Quiet Sun; Solar telescopes; Solar coronal mass ejections; Space probes	MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; ACCELERATION; WIND; SUN; FLARE; CORONA	The Energetic Particle Instrument-Low Energy (EPI-Lo) experiment has detected several weak, low-energy (similar to 30-300 keV nucleon(-1)) solar energetic particle (SEP) events during its first two closest approaches to the Sun, providing a unique opportunity to explore the sources of low-energy particle acceleration. As part of theParker Solar Probe(PSP) Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS) suite, EPI-Lo was designed to investigate the physics of energetic particles; however, in the special lowest-energy "time-of-flight only" product used in this study, it also responds to solar photons in a subset of approximately sunward-looking apertures lacking special light-attenuating foils. During the first three perihelia, in a frame rotating with the Sun,PSPundergoes retrograde motion, covering a 17 degrees heliographic longitudinal range three times during the course of the similar to 11-day perihelion passes, permitting a unique spatial and temporal study into the location, correlation, and persistence of previously unmeasurable SEPs. We examine the signatures of these SEPs (during the firstPSPperihelion pass only) and the connection to possible solar sources using remote observations from theSolar Dynamics Observatory(SDO), theSolar TErrestrial RElations Observatory(STEREO), and the ground-based Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). The orientation of the Sun relative toSTEREO,SDO, and GONG makes such identifications challenging, but we do have several candidates, including an equatorial coronal hole at a Carrington longitude of similar to 335 degrees. To analyze observations from EPI-Lo, which is a new type of particle instrument, we examine instrumental effects and provide a preliminary separation of the ion signal from the photon background.

Observations of the 2019 April 4 Solar Energetic Particle Event at theParker Solar Probe	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						The Sun; Solar energetic particles	HELIUM ABUNDANCE; LARGE-ANGLE; ACCELERATION; MISSION; SURGES; CORONA	A solar energetic particle event was detected by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS) instrument suite onParker Solar Probe(PSP) on 2019 April 4 when the spacecraft was inside of 0.17 au and less than 1 day before its second perihelion, providing an opportunity to study solar particle acceleration and transport unprecedentedly close to the source. The event was very small, with peak 1 MeV proton intensities of similar to 0.3 particles (cm(2)sr s MeV)(-1), and was undetectable above background levels at energies above 10 MeV or in particle detectors at 1 au. It was strongly anisotropic, with intensities flowing outward from the Sun up to 30 times greater than those flowing inward persisting throughout the event. Temporal association between particle increases and small brightness surges in the extreme-ultraviolet observed by theSolar TErrestrial RElations Observatory, which were also accompanied by type III radio emission seen by the Electromagnetic Fields Investigation onPSP, indicates that the source of this event was an active region nearly 80 degrees east of the nominalPSPmagnetic footpoint. This suggests that the field lines expanded over a wide longitudinal range between the active region in the photosphere and the corona.	[Leske, R. A.; Cohen, C. M. S.; Cummings, A. C.; Davis, A.

X-Ray Ionization of Planet-opened Gaps in Protostellar Disks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							MAIN-SEQUENCE TRACKS; MAGNETOROTATIONAL INSTABILITY; PROTOPLANETARY DISKS; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; DEAD ZONE; SATURATION; FLOWS	Young planets with masses approaching Jupiter's have tides strong enough to clear gaps around their orbits in the protostellar disk. Gas flow through the gaps regulates the planets' further growth and governs the disk's evolution. Magnetic forces may drive that flow if the gas is sufficiently ionized to couple to the fields. We compute the ionizing effects of the X-rays from the central young star, using Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to find the spectrum of Compton-scattered photons reaching the planet's vicinity. The scattered X-rays ionize the gas at rates similar to or greater than the interstellar cosmic-ray rate near planets with the masses of Saturn and of Jupiter, located at 5 au and at 10 au, in disks with the interstellar mass fraction of sub-micron dust and with the dust depleted by a factor 100. Solving a gas-grain recombination reaction network yields charged particle populations whose ability to carry currents is sufficient to partly couple the magnetic fields to the gas around the planet. Most cases can undergo Hall-shear instability, and some can launch magnetocentrifugal winds. However, the material on the planet's orbit has diffusivities so large in all the cases we examine that magnetorotational turbulence is prevented and the non-ideal terms govern the magnetic field's evolution. Thus the flow of gas in the gaps opened by young giant planets depends crucially on the finite conductivity.	[Kim, S. Y.] CALTECH, Div Phys Math & Astron, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Kim, S.

Solar Wind Streams and Stream Interaction Regions Observed by the Parker Solar Probe with Corresponding Observations at 1 au	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							COROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS; ALPHA MONITOR; PROTON; INTERPLANETARY; ELECTRON; ACCELERATION; PLASMA	Several fast solar wind streams and stream interaction regions (SIRs) were observed by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its first orbit (2018 September-2019 January). During this time, several recurring SIRs were also seen at 1 au at both L1 (Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) and Wind) and the location of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A). In this paper, we compare four fast streams observed by PSP at different radial distances during its first orbit. For three of these fast stream events, measurements from L1 (ACE and Wind) and STEREO-A indicated that the fast streams were observed by both PSP and at least one of the 1 au monitors. Our associations are supported by simulations made by the ENLIL model driven by GONG-(ADAPT-) WSA, which allows us to contextualize the inner heliospheric conditions during the first orbit of PSP. Additionally, we determine which of these fast streams are associated with an SIR and characterize the SIR properties for these events. From these comparisons, we find that the compression region associated with the fast-speed streams overtaking the preceding solar wind can form at various radial distances from the Sun in the inner heliosphere inside 0.5 au, with the suprathermal ion population (energies between 30 and 586 keV) observed as isolated enhancements suggesting localized acceleration near the SIR stream interface at similar to 0.3 au, which is unlike those seen at 1 au, where the suprathermal enhancements extend throughout and behind the SIR. This suprathermal enhancement extends further into the fast stream with increasing distance from the Sun.	[Allen, R. C.; Ho, G. C.; Mason, G. M.; Hill, M. E.; McNutt, R.; Mitchell, D.

WISPR Imaging of a Pristine CME	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS; PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATION; SOLAR-WIND; EVOLUTION; ORIGIN; II.	The Wide-field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) on board the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed a coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2018 November 1, the first day of the initial PSP encounter. The speed of the CME, approximately 200-300 km s(-1) in the WISPR field of view, is typical of slow, streamer blowout CMEs. This event was also observed by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) coronagraphs. WISPR and LASCO view remarkably similar structures that enable useful cross-comparison between the two data sets as well as stereoscopic imaging of the CME. An analysis is extended to lower heights by linking the white-light observations to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, which reveal a structure that erupts more than a full day earlier before the CME finally gathers enough velocity to propagate outward. This EUV feature appears as a brightness enhancement in cooler temperatures, such as 171 angstrom, but as a cavity in nominal coronal temperatures, such as 193 angstrom. By comparing this circular, dark feature in 193 angstrom to the dark, white-light cavity at the center of the eruption in WISPR and LASCO, this is one coherent structure is seen to exist prior to the eruption in the low corona before entering the heliosphere and likely corresponds to the core of the magnetic flux rope. It is also believed that the relative weakness of the event contributed to the clarity of the flux rope in WISPR, as the CME did not experience impulsive forces or strong interaction with external structures that can lead to more complex structural evolution.

Energetic Particle Observations from the Parker Solar Probe Using Combined Energy Spectra from the IS circle dot IS Instrument Suite	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article							COROTATING INTERACTION REGIONS; ACCELERATION; EVENTS	The Integrated Science Investigations of the Sun (IS circle dot IS) instrument suite includes two Energetic Particle instruments: EPI-Hi, designed to measure ions from similar to 1 to 200 MeV nuc(-1), and EPI-Lo, designed to measure ions from similar to 20 to similar to 15 MeV nuc(-1). We present an analysis of eight energetic proton events observed across the energy range of both instruments during Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) first two orbits in order to examine their combined energy spectra. Background corrections are applied to help resolve spectral breaks between the two instruments and are shown to be effective. In doing so we demonstrate that even in the early stages of calibration, IS circle dot IS is capable of producing reliable spectral observations across broad energy ranges. In addition to making groundbreaking measurements very near the Sun, IS circle dot IS also characterizes energetic particle populations over a range of heliocentric distances inside 1 au. During the first two orbits, IS circle dot IS observed energetic particle events from a single corotating interaction region (CIR) at three different distances from the Sun. The events are separated by two Carrington rotations and just 0.11 au in distance; however, the relationship shown between proton intensities and proximity of the spacecraft to the source region shows evidence of the importance of transport effects on observations of energetic particles from CIRs. Future IS circle dot IS observations of similar events over larger distances will help disentangle the effects of CIR-related acceleration and transport. We apply similar spectral analyses to the remaining five events, including four that are likely related to stream interaction regions (SIRs) and one solar energetic particle (SEP) event.	[Joyce, C.

During this time, the Energetic Particle Instrument-Hi (EPI-Hi, one of the two energetic particle instruments comprising the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, IS circle dot IS) measured seven proton intensity increases associated with stream interaction regions (SIRs), two of which appear to be occurring in the same region corotating with the Sun. The events are relatively weak, with observed proton spectra extending to only a few MeV and lasting for a few days. The proton spectra are best characterized by power laws with indices ranging from -4.3 to -6.5, generally softer than events associated with SIRs observed at 1 au and beyond. Helium spectra were also obtained with similar indices, allowing He/H abundance ratios to be calculated for each event. We find values of 0.016-0.031, which are consistent with ratios obtained previously for corotating interaction region events with fast solar wind <= 600 km s(-1). Using the observed solar wind data combined with solar wind simulations, we study the solar wind structures associated with these events and identify additional spacecraft near 1 au appropriately positioned to observe the same structures after some corotation. Examination of the energetic particle observations from these spacecraft yields two events that may correspond to the energetic particle increases seen by EPI-Hi earlier.	[Cohen, C. M.

GRACE-based Mass Conservation as a Validation Target for Basin-Scale Evapotranspiration in the Contiguous United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						evapotranspiration; GRACE; water balance; model evaluation; remote sensing	WATER-BALANCE; GLOBAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; PRECIPITATION; FLUX; UNCERTAINTY; EVAPORATION; FUTURE; MODIS	Here, we evaluate basin-scale evapotranspiration (ET) estimates for eleven major river basins in the contiguous United States against a water balance approach with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite observations. The relatively precise measurements of large-scale changes in water mass from GRACE are used to estimate the storage rate term in the terrestrial water budget and consequently provide an estimate, with propagated uncertainty, of basin-aggregated ET from mass conservation. We apply GRACE-based ET to two modeling systems (NLDAS-2 and GLDAS-2.1) comprised of five land surface models and three remote sensing-based products (MOD16, PT-JPL, and FLUXCOM) for 2003 to 2014. Both the land surface model-based and remote sensing-based ET are persistently lower than GRACE-based ET in all eleven basins tested. We also find that interannual variability is greater for GRACE-ET than the model and remote sensing products, and this is attributed to precipitation variability.

However, the causes of the GPP:SIF relationship deviating from a linear pattern remain unclear. In the current study conducted at two maize sites in Nebraska in 2017 summer growing season, we investigated the relationship between GPP and SIF at 760 nm (F-760) at two temporal scales and quantified the contributions of incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(in)), fraction of absorbed PAR (fPAR), light use efficiency (LUE), and F-760 yield (F-760,F-y, defined as F-760/(PAR(in)xfPAR)) to GPP and F-760 variabilities to further understand the linearity and deviations in the GPP:F-760 relationship. We found the following: (1) For individual growth stages when canopy structure and chlorophyll content were stable, GPP and F-760 were strongly controlled by PAR(in), while LUE and F-760,F-y had much lower contributions to the GPP:F-760 relationship; during this period, LUE and F-760,F-y had either a slightly negative or no clear relationship, which explained some deviations in the GPP:SIF relationship. (2) At the seasonal scale, the contribution of LUE to GPP variability as well as the contribution of F-760,F-y to F-760 variability increased and was comparable to the contribution of PAR(in); the LUE:F-760,F-y relationship showed a strong linear relationship, which strengthened the linear GPP:F-760 relationship. Both maize sites showed similar patterns. A framework was applied to estimate LUE at individual stages and as a result, significantly improved the GPP estimation, thus enhancing the SIF potential for inferring photosynthesis. Key Points Driver contributions to the relationship between sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and gross primary production vary with temporal scale Incoming photosynthetically active radiation controls the variations of SIF and gross primary production at maize peak growth stage Contributions of SIF yield and light use efficiency to SIF and gross primary production increase significantly over the growing season	[Miao, Guofang; Guan, Kaiyu; Kimm, Hyungsuk; Wu, Genghong] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Guan, Kaiyu] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Suyker, Andrew E.; Walter-Shea, Elizabeth A.; Hmimina, Gabriel Y.; Gamon, John A.; Franz, Trenton E.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Nat Resources, Lincoln, NE USA; [Yang, Xi] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Arkebauer, Timothy J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE USA; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Gamon, John A.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Frankenberg, Christian] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Berry, Joseph A.] Carnegie Inst Sci, Dept Global Ecol, Stanford, CA USA	Miao, GF; Guan, KY (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.; Guan, KY (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.	guofang.miao@gmail.com; kaiyug@illinois.edu	; Gamon, John/A-2641-2014	Kim, Hyungsuk/0000-0001-8189-0874; Gamon, John/0000-0002-8269-7723; Yang, Xi/0000-0002-5095-6735; Franz, Trenton/0000-0003-2947-0906	NASA New Investigator AwardNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Terrestrial Ecology ProgramNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); DOE CABBIUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); NASA Carbon Cycle ScienceNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Lawrence Berkeley National Lab AmeriFlux Data Management Program; Carbon Sequestration Program, University of NebraskaLincoln Agricultural Research Division; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station; Hatch Act through the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [1002649]	K.

Hypervelocity Impact Experiments in Iron-Nickel Ingots and Iron Meteorites: Implications for the NASA Psyche Mission	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							DUCTILE-BRITTLE TRANSITION; ASTEROID 16 PSYCHE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; YARKOVSKY; CRATERS; HISTORY; SURFACE; SHAPE	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Psyche mission will visit the 226-km diameter main belt asteroid (16) Psyche, our first opportunity to visit a metal-rich object at close range. The unique and poorly understood nature of Psyche offers a challenge to the mission as we have little understanding of the surface morphology and composition. It is commonly accepted that the main evolutionary process for asteroid surfaces is impact cratering. While a considerable body of literature is available on collisions on rocky/icy objects, less work is available for metallic targets with compositions relevant to Psyche. Here we present a suite of impact experiments performed at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range facility on several types of iron meteorites and foundry-cast ingots that have similar Fe-Ni compositions as the iron meteorites. Our experiments were designed to better understand crater formation (e.g., size, depth), over a range of impact conditions, including target temperature and composition. We find that the target strength, as inferred from crater sizes, ranges from 700 to 1,300 MPa. Target temperature has measurable effects on strength, with cooled targets typically 10-20% stronger. Crater morphologies are characterized by sharp, raised rims and deep cavities. Further, we derive broad implications for Psyche's collisional evolution, in light of available low resolution shape models. We find that the number of large craters (>50 km) is particularly diagnostic for the overall bulk strength of Psyche. If confirmed, the number of putative large craters may indicate that Psyche's bulk strength is significantly reduced compared to that of intact iron meteorites. Plain Language Summary Many iron meteorites are thought to be remnants of the cores of melted asteroids. Some cores may have been exposed by collisions during the earliest days of Solar System history, with a few survivors possibly found today in the main asteroid belt. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Psyche mission will be the first spacecraft to visit asteroid (16) Psyche, an object thought to be representative of these metallic asteroids. Impacts onto (16) Psyche in the past may therefore be able to tell us about the history and nature of this body. To this end, we performed high-speed impact experiments into metallic targets in order to understand how crater formation differs from rocky bodies. These experiments revealed that impact craters into metal targets are deeper and have sharper rims than on their rocky counterparts. These results will be crucial for interpreting both the bulk properties of Psyche's interior and the modification of Psyche's surface when the Psyche mission reaches its target.

Grain Size Variations in the Murray Formation: Stratigraphic Evidence for Changing Depositional Environments in Gale Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT SUITE; PAHRUMP HILLS; CALCIUM-SULFATE; MOUNT SHARP; EVOLUTION; ROCKS; MUDSTONE; FEATURES; OUTCROP; ORIGIN	The lowermost exposure of the Murray formation in Gale crater, Mars, was interpreted as sediment deposited in an ancient lake based on data collected by the Curiosity rover. Constraining the stratigraphic extent and duration of this environment has important implications for the paleohydrology of Gale. Insights into early Martian environments and paleofluid flow velocity can be obtained from grain size in rocks. Visual inspection of grain size is not always available for rocks investigated at field sites on Mars due to limited image coverage. But grain sizes can also be estimated from the Gini Index Mean Score, a grain-size proxy that uses point-to-point chemical variations in ChemCam Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy data. New Gini Index Mean Score results indicate that the Murray formation is dominated by mudstones with grains smaller than the spatial resolution of all rover cameras. Intervals of fine to coarse sandstone also are present, some of which are verified using observations of grain size and sedimentary structures in associated images. Overall, results demonstrate that most of the Murray consists of mudstone, suggesting settling of grains from suspension in low energy depositional environments such as lakes. Some of the mudstones contain desiccation cracks indicating periods of drying with a lowering of lake water level. However, beds and lenses of cross-bedded sandstones are common at specific intervals, suggesting episodes of fluvial and possibly eolian deposition. The persistence of lacustrine deposits interspersed with fluvial deposits suggests that liquid water was sustained on the Martian surface for tens of thousands to millions of years. Plain Language Summary The lowest exposed rocks of the Murray formation in Gale crater, Mars, are interpreted as ancient lake deposits based on Curiosity rover data. However, the duration and temporal variability of this ancient lake is still an open question. Here we characterize the vertical distribution of deposits within the entire Murray formation using new grain size information. Characterizing grain size in rocks provides information about the speed of past fluid flows, which is crucial for interpreting depositional environments. However, measuring grain size in images is rarely possible for Martian rocks. Thus, we estimate grain sizes with the Gini Index Mean Score, a grain-size proxy that uses ChemCam Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy data. Gini Index Mean Score results indicate that the Murray formation is dominated by rocks with mud-sized grains (i.e., mudstones), suggesting mud-sized grains settled in a low energy lake environment. Mud cracks occur in some of the mudstones, indicating drying periods in a lake. Rocks with sand-sized grains (i.e., sandstones) and cross bedding occur at specific intervals, suggesting episodes with stream channels and wind-blown sand dunes. The dominance of lake deposits interspersed with stream deposits suggests that liquid water was present in Gale crater for tens of thousands to millions of years.

Method to Derive Ion Properties From Juno JADE Including Abundance Estimates for O+ and S2+	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							THIN CARBON FOILS; DEPENDENT ENERGY-LOSS; CHARGE-EXCHANGE; SOLAR-WIND; HYDROGEN-IONS; HOT IONS; HEAVY-IONS; MAGNETOSPHERE; PARTICLES; JUPITER	The Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment Ion sensor (JADE-I) on Juno is a plasma instrument that measures the energy-per-charge (E/Q) distribution of 0.01 to 46.2 keV/q ions over a mass-per-charge (M/Q) range of 1-64 amu/q. However, distinguishing O+ and S2+ from JADE-I's measurements is a challenging task due to similarities in their M/Q (similar to 16 amu/q). Because of this, O+ and S2+ have not been fully resolved in the in situ measurements made by plasma instruments at Jupiter (e.g., Voyager PLS and Galileo PLS) and their relative ratios has been studied using physical chemistry models and ultraviolet remote observations. To resolve this ambiguity, a ray tracing simulation combined with carbon foil effects is developed and used to obtain instrument response functions for H+, O+, O2+, O3+, Na+, S+, S2+, and S3+. The simulation results indicate that JADE-I can resolve the M/Q ambiguity between O+ and S2+ due to a significant difference in their charge state modification process and a presence of a large electric potential difference (similar to 8 kV) between its carbon foils and MCPs. A forward model based on instrument response functions and convected kappa distributions is then used to obtain ion properties at the equatorial plasma sheet (similar to 36 RJ) in the predawn sector of magnetosphere. The number density ratio between O+ and S2+ for the selected plasma sheet crossings ranges from 0.2 to 0.7 (0.37 +/- 0.12) and the number density ratio between total oxygen ions to total sulfur ions ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 (0.41 +/- 0.09).

Improved Global Nonlinear Surface Mass Variation Estimates From Geodetic Displacements and Reconciliation With GRACE Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							GEOCENTER MOTION; KALMAN FILTER; VARIABILITY; GPS	Spatiotemporal coverage gaps and the nature of distant signature sources in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data require global inversions of data combinations for cross validation and complete and continuous monitoring of surface water mass variations. For spectral completeness, accurate data-based degree-1 surface mass variation coefficient or equivalent geocenter motion estimates are also desired but very difficult to obtain. To improve the reliability of such estimates, we carry out a new effort to combine different space geodetic technique data in a Kalman filter and time series approach to Terrestrial Reference Frame realization using an advanced formulation. With origin at the center of mass of the Earth system, the new parameterization now includes site displacements in the state vector explicitly for realistic assessment of their covariance matrices. More robust geocenter motion results are achieved when the displacement information is combined further with GRACE gravity data in a unified inversion. Previously, various systematic effects in GNSS data resulted in rather large discrepancies in global surface mass change estimates when compared with those from GRACE gravity data. Here, we show that significantly improved GNSS data after reprocessing and the refined Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) bottom pressure model reveal a global surface mass variation pattern that has been largely reconciled with that from GRACE data.

Patterns and Dynamics of SST Fronts in the California Current System	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							EDGE-DETECTION; OCEAN; GRADIENTS; COMPENSATION; TEMPERATURE; EDDY	The California Current System (CCS) is one of the four major Eastern Boundary Current Systems, where major coastal upwelling is observed in the ocean. Oceanic fronts are abundant in the CCS, and are known to be associated with coastal upwelling. Analyses of satellite observations (altimetry and sea surface temperature, SST) of the CCS highlight the presence of SST fronts in the southern part of the CCS outside of the coastal upwelling season, which will be investigated. The submesoscale-permitting and tidal-resolving LLC4320-simulation was used to analyze the nature of these features, through the study of the surface density gradients, the vertical velocities and the horizontal strain. An algorithm was also developed to track SST fronts in the model. The classical scenario of coastal upwelling is confirmed in the central CCS (off California), with a strain field correlated to vertical velocities associated with the SST fronts, and collocated density fronts. In contrast, in the southern CCS (off Baja California), vertical velocities were much weaker and density gradients were not always observed where SST fronts were detected, leading to the assumption that the fronts there may be affected by thermohaline compensation occurring in the region. These findings confirm the existence of SST fronts in the CCS outside of the traditional coastal upwelling framework, with part of the fronts in the southern CCS being passive and advected by the background flow.

J	Mazloff, MR; Cornuelle, B; Gille, ST; Wang, JB				Mazloff, Matthew R.; Cornuelle, Bruce; Gille, Sarah T.; Wang, Jinbo			The Importance of Remote Forcing for Regional Modeling of Internal Waves	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; OPEN BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; SEA-SURFACE HEIGHT; UNBALANCED MOTIONS; OCEAN; TOPOGRAPHY; TIDES; DECOMPOSITION; DISSIPATION; TRANSITION	Regional ocean general circulation models are generally forced at the boundaries by mesoscale ocean dynamics and barotropic tides. In this work we provide evidence that remotely forced internal waves can be a significant source of energy for the dynamics. We compare global and regional model solutions within the California Current System. Both models have similar inputs, forcings, and identical grids and numerics. The global model has a steric height power spectrum consistent with mooring observations at superinertial frequencies, while the regional model spectrum is weaker. The regional model also has less sea surface height variance at high wavenumber than the global model. The vertical velocity variance is significantly larger in the global model, except in the sheltered Southern California Bight. While the regional model has roughly equal high-pass baroclinic and barotropic kinetic energy levels, the global model high-pass baroclinic kinetic energy is 28% (0.39 PJ) greater than the barotropic energy. An internal wave energy flux analysis reveals that the regional model domain boundaries act as a sink of 183MW, while in the global model the analysis domain boundaries act as a source of 539MW. This 722MW difference can account for the relative increase of 0.39 PJ high-pass baroclinic energy in the global model, assuming a baroclinic kinetic energy dissipation time in the domain of approximately 6.3 days. The results here imply that most regional ocean models will need to account for internal wave boundary fluxes in order to reproduce the observed internal wave continuum spectrum. Plain Language Summary Global ocean simulations can be too computationally expensive, so many researchers prefer to use lower cost regional ocean models. The open ocean boundary conditions of these regional models must be prescribed from other products. It is common practice for these prescribed conditions to lack high-frequency oceanic variability. Here we show that this missing component of the dynamics may account for a large amount of the overall high-frequency energy in the region. Without this, remotely forced energy input regional models may underestimate processes important to the overall state (e.g., upwelling processes fundamental to the ocean ecosystems). Regional models must account for these remotely forced dynamical signals in order to produce simulations with realistic short time- and space-scale variability.

Studies of a Lacustrine-Volcanic Mars Analog Field Site With Mars-2020-Like Instruments	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; CHEMCAM INSTRUMENT; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; GALE CRATER; GRAIN-SIZE; ROCKS; SUITE; ROVER; IDENTIFICATION; MINERALOGY	On the upcoming Mars-2020 rover two remote sensing instruments, Mastcam-Z and SuperCam, and two microscopic proximity science instruments, Scanning for Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) and Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), will collect compositional (mineralogy, chemistry, and organics) data essential for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The synergies between and limitations of these instruments were evaluated via study of a Mars analog field site in the Mojave desert, using instruments approximating the data that will be returned by Mars-2020. A ground truth data set was generated for comparison to validate the results. The site consists of a succession of clay-rich mudstones of lacustrine origin, interbedded tuffs, a carbonate-silica travertine deposit, and gypsiferous mudstone strata. The major geological units were mapped successfully using simulated Mars-2020 data. Simulated Mastcam-Z data identified unit boundaries and Fe-bearing weathering products. Simulated SuperCam passive shortwave infrared and green Raman data were essential in identifying major mineralogical composition and changes in lacustrine facies at distance; this was possible even with spectrally downsampled passive IR data. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and simulated PIXL data discriminated and mapped major element chemistry. Simulated PIXL revealed millimeter-scale zones enriched in zirconium, of interest for age dating. Scanning for SHERLOC-like data mapped sulfate and carbonate at submillimeter scale; silicates were identified with increased laser pulses/spot or by averaging of hundreds of spectra. Fluorescence scans detected and mapped varied classes of organics in all samples, characterized further with follow-on spatially targeted deep-UV Raman spectra. Development of dedicated organics spectral libraries is needed to aid interpretation. Given these observations, the important units in the outcrop would be sampled and cached for sample return.

We find a wider spread of historical cloud fraction changes in the CMIP6 than was simulated by the CMIP5. The global mean cloud fractions of CMIP6 increased by about 4.5% from the CMIP5, which attributed to greater changes in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. The CMIP6 cloud fractions in recent years are validated with the CALIPSO_CLOUSAT observations to understand the cloud fraction uncertainties in CMIP6 models. The CMIP6 ensemble mean of cloud fractions compares well with the observations with a mean difference of 0.5% in lower altitudes. The CMIP6 cloud fractions are higher than the observations at higher latitudes in both hemispheres in the upper troposphere, and the biases vary from one model to another. The spatial difference between the ensemble and observations is further revealed over the tropics: where the model displays a 3% higher bias. In addition, we observed a significant trend occuring in the northern hemisphere since the mid-20th century using calculations of cloud fraction trends based on the robust regression technique. Finally, we reduce the differences between the model and observations by applying a simple regression technique. The results exemplify that the model and modified observations compare well, with the root mean square value decreased by nearly 28%, and the correlation increased significantly.	[Vignesh, P.

Most of the geospatial data portals use keyword-based match to search data. Little attention has focused on the spatial and temporal information from a query or understanding the query with ontology. No research in the geospatial domain has investigated user queries in a systematic way. Here, we propose a query understanding framework and apply it to fill the gap by better interpreting a user's search intent for Earth data search engines and adopting knowledge that was mined from metadata and user query logs. The proposed query understanding tool contains four components: spatial and temporal parsing; concept recognition; Named Entity Recognition (NER); and, semantic query expansion. Spatial and temporal parsing detects the spatial bounding box and temporal range from a query. Concept recognition isolates clauses from free text and provides the search engine phrases instead of a list of words. Name entity recognition detects entities from the query, which inform the search engine to query the entities detected. The semantic query expansion module expands the original query by adding synonyms and acronyms to phrases in the query that was discovered from Web usage data and metadata. The four modules interact to parse a user's query from multiple perspectives, with the goal of understanding the consumer's quest intent for data. As a proof-of-concept, the framework is applied to oceanographic data discovery. It is demonstrated that the proposed framework accurately captures a user's intent.

Both the near-infrared and submillimeter observations reveal several clear structures extending to similar to 240 au from the stars. Based on these observations at different wavelengths, we report the following discoveries. One arm-like structure detected in the near-infrared band initially extends from the south of the binary with a subsequent turn to the northeast, corresponding to two bar-like structures detected in ALMA observations with an local standard of rest kinematic (LSRK) velocity of 1.19-5.64 km s(-1). Another feature detected in the near-infrared band extends initially from the north of the binary, relating to an arm-like structure detected in ALMA observations with an LSRK velocity of 8.17-16.43 km s(-1). From their shapes and velocities, we suggest that these structures can mostly be explained by two streamers that connect the outer circumbinary disk and the central binary components. These discoveries will be helpful for understanding the evolution of streamers and circumstellar disks in young binary systems.

Pre-discovery Activity of New Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov beyond 5 au	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							AMORPHOUS WATER ICE; HALE-BOPP; NUCLEUS; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; P/HALLEY; DUST; CO	Comet 2I/Borisov, the first unambiguous interstellar comet ever found, was discovered in 2019 August at similar to 3 au from the Sun on its inbound leg. No pre-discovery detection beyond 3 au has yet been reported, mostly due to the comet's proximity to the Sun as seen from the Earth. Here we present a search for pre-discovery detections of comet Borisov using images taken by the Catalina Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with a further comprehensive follow-up campaign being presented in Bolin et al. We identified comet Borisov in ZTF images taken in 2019 May and use these data to update its orbit. This allowed us to identify the comet in images acquired as far back as 2018 December, when it was 7.8 au from the Sun. The comet was not detected in 2018 November when it was 8.6 au from the Sun, possibly implying an onset of activity around this time. This suggests that the activity of the comet is either driven by a more volatile species other than H2O, such as CO or CO2, or by exothermic crystallization of amorphous ice. We derive the radius of the nucleus to be <7 km using the non-detection in 2018 November, and estimate an area of similar to 0.5-10 has been active between 2018 December and 2019 September, though this number is model-dependent and is highly uncertain. The behavior of comet Borisov during its inbound leg is observationally consistent with dynamically new comets observed in our solar system, suggesting some similarities between the two.

In addition, phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) and numerical calculations based on the Lorenz-Mie theory are also employed in order to extract the droplets Sauter mean diameter (SMD), the droplets number density (N), and the liquid volume fraction (LVF) in a steady asymmetric hollow cone water spray. The SLIPI-LIF/Mie ratio is converted to droplets SMD by means of a calibration procedure based on PDA measurements. The droplet SMD for the investigated spray varies from 20 mu m to 60 mu m, the N values range from 5 to 60 droplets per mm(3), and the LVF varies between 0.05 x 10(-4) and 5.5 x 10(-4) within the probed region of the spray. To generate a series of two-dimensional images at different planes, the spray scanning procedure is operated in a "bread slicing" manner by moving the spray perpendicularly to the light sheet axis. From the resulting series of images, the procedure described here shows the possibility of obtaining three-dimensional reconstructions of each scalar quantity, allowing a more complete characterization of droplet clouds forming the spray region.

This relation is unconstrained by observations on sub-galactic scales. We derive the first measurement of the mass-concentration relation using the image positions and flux ratios from 11 quadruple-image strong gravitational lenses (quads) in the mass range 10(6)-10(10)M(circle dot), assuming cold dark matter. We model both subhaloes and line-of-sight haloes, finite-size background sources, and marginalize over nuisance parameters describing the lens macromodel. We also marginalize over the logarithmic slope and redshift evolution of the mass-concentration relation, using flat priors that encompass the range of theoretical uncertainty in the literature. At z = 0, we constrain the concentration of 10(8) M-circle dot haloes c = 12(-5)(+6) at 68 per cent CI, and c = 12(-9)(+15) at 95 per cent CI. For a 10(7) M-circle dot halo, we obtain 68 per cent (95 per cent) constraints c = 151 (c = 15(-11)(+18)), while for 10(9) M-circle dot haloes c = 10(-4)(+7) (c = 10(-7)(+1)(4)). These results are consistent with the theoretical predictions from mass-concentration relations in the literature and establish strong lensing by galaxies as a powerful probe of halo concentrations on sub-galactic scales across cosmological distance.

He-3-rich Solar Energetic Particle Observations at the Parker Solar Probe and near Earth	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Solar energetic particles; Solar activity; Solar x-ray flares	ALPHA MONITOR; ACCELERATION; TRANSPORT; ELECTRON; PROTON	The Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (IS circle dot IS) instrument suite on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) spacecraft is making in situ observations of energetic ions and electrons closer to the Sun than any previous mission. Using data collected during its first two orbits, which reached perihelion distances of 0.17 au, we have searched for He-3-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events under very quiet solar minimum conditions. On 2019-110-111 (April 20-21), He-3-rich SEPs were observed at energies near 1MeV nucleon(-1) in association with energetic protons, heavy ions, and electrons. This activity was also detected by the Ultra-Low-Energy Isotope Spectrometer and the Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor instruments on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft located near Earth, 0.99 au from the Sun. At that time, PSP and ACE were both magnetically connected to locations near the west limb of the Sun. Remote sensing measurements showed the presence of type III radio bursts and also helical jets from this region of the Sun. This combination of observations is commonly associated with He-3-rich SEP acceleration on the Sun. AR 12738, which was located at Carrington coordinates from which numerous X-ray flares were observed over a period of more than 6 months, was identified as the source of the He-3-rich events. This region was also the source of several other SEP events detected at PSP or ACE. Aside from the period in 2019 April, IS circle dot IS did not observe any other He-3-rich SEPs during orbits 1 and 2.	[Wiedenbeck, M.

The HSC first-year shape catalog is divided into four tomographic redshift bins ranging from z= 0.3 to 1.5 with equal widths of Delta z= 0.3. The unweighted galaxy number densities in each tomographic bin are 5.9, 5.9, 4.3, and 2.4 arcmin(-2) from the lowestto highest redshifts, respectively. We adopt the standard TPCF estimators, xi(+/-) for our cosmological analysis, given that we find no evidence of significant B-mode shear. The TPCFs are detected at high significance for all 10 combinations of auto- and cross-tomographic bins over a wide angular range, yielding a total signal-tonoise ratio of 19 in the angular ranges adopted in the cosmological analysis, 7' < theta < 56' for xi(+) and 28' < theta < 178' for xi(-). We perform the standard Bayesian likelihood analysis for cosmological inference from the measured cosmic shear TPCFs, including contributions from intrinsic alignment of galaxies as well as systematic effects from PSF model errors, shear calibration uncertainty, and source redshift distribution errors. We adopt a covariance matrix derived from realistic mock catalogs constructed from full-sky gravitational lensing simulations that fully account for survey geometry and measurement noise. For a flat Lambda cold dark matter model, we find S-8 (math) sigma(8)root Omega(m)/0.3 = 0.8041(-0.029)(+0.032) and Omega(m) = 0.346(-0.100)(+0.052). We carefully check the robustness of the cosmological results against astrophysical modeling uncertainties and systematic uncertainties in measurements, and find that none of them has a significant impact on the cosmological constraints.

Evaluation of simulated soil carbon dynamics in Arctic-Boreal ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						soil carbon; Arctic-Boreal; terrestrial carbon cycle; soil respiration; functional benchmark	MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; PROGRAM MULTISCALE SYNTHESIS; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PERMAFROST CARBON; GLOBAL PATTERNS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPIRATION; STORAGE; TUNDRA; CYCLE	Given the magnitude of soil carbon stocks in northern ecosystems, and the vulnerability of these stocks to climate warming, land surface models must accurately represent soil carbon dynamics in these regions. We evaluate soil carbon stocks and turnover rates, and the relationship between soil carbon loss with soil temperature and moisture, from an ensemble of eleven global land surface models. We focus on the region of NASA's Arctic-Boreal vulnerability experiment (ABoVE) in North America to inform data collection and model development efforts. Models exhibit an order of magnitude difference in estimates of current total soil carbon stocks, generally under- or overestimating the size of current soil carbon stocks by greater than 50 PgC. We find that a model's soil carbon stock at steady-state in 1901 is the prime driver of its soil carbon stock a hundred years later-overwhelming the effect of environmental forcing factors like climate. The greatest divergence between modeled and observed soil carbon stocks is in regions dominated by peat and permafrost soils, suggesting that models are failing to capture the frozen soil carbon dynamics of permafrost regions. Using a set of functional benchmarks to test the simulated relationship of soil respiration to both soil temperature and moisture, we find that although models capture the observed shape of the soil moisture response of respiration, almost half of the models examined show temperature sensitivities, or Q10 values, that are half of observed. Significantly, models that perform better against observational constraints of respiration or carbon stock size do not necessarily perform well in terms of their functional response to key climatic factors like changing temperature. This suggests that models may be arriving at the right result, but for the wrong reason. The results of this work can help to bridge the gap between data and models by both pointing to the need to constrain initial carbon pool sizes, as well as highlighting the importance of incorporating functional benchmarks into ongoing, mechanistic modeling activities such as those included in ABoVE.

Exposure to cold temperature affects the spring phenology of Alaskan deciduous vegetation types	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Alaskan deciduous vegetation; leaf budburst; GPP onset; community land model; chilling requirement	TERRESTRIAL CARBON-CYCLE; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; SEASONAL CYCLE; CLIMATE; MODEL; CO2; RESPIRATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; WINTER	Temperature is a dominant factor driving arctic and boreal ecosystem phenology, including leaf budburst and gross primary production (GPP) onset in Alaskan spring. Previous studies hypothesized that both accumulated growing degree day (GDD) and cold temperature (chilling) exposure are important to leaf budburst. We test this hypothesis by combining both satellite and aircraft vegetation measurements with the Community Land Model Version 4.5 (CLM), in which the end of plant dormancy depends on thermal conditions (i.e. GDD). We study the sensitivity of GPP onset of different Alaskan deciduous vegetation types to a GDD model with chilling requirement (GC model) included. The default CLM simulations have a 1-12 d earlier day of year GPP onset over Alaska vegetated regions compared to satellite constrained estimates from the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model. Integrating a GC model into CLM shifts the phase and amplitude of GPP. During 2007-2016, mean GPP onset is postponed by 5 +/- 7, 4 +/- 8, and 1 +/- 6 d over Alaskan northern tundra, shrub, and forest, respectively. The GC model has the greatest impact during warm springs, which is critical for predicting phenology response to future warming. Overall, spring GPP high bias is reduced by 10%. Thus, including chilling requirement in thermal forcing models improves northern high-latitude phenology, but leads to other impacts during the growing season which require further investigation.

Helicopter flight on Mars is challenging due to the extremely thin atmosphere, which is only partially offset by a reduction in gravity. This paper focuses on flight dynamics and controllability issues for the Mars Helicopter: in particular, the areas in which the dynamics differs from typical behavior on Earth. The paper discusses insights gained from modeling and simulation, as well as system identification performed with a test vehicle in the relevant atmospheric conditions, which culminated in the first demonstration of controlled helicopter flight in Martian atmospheric conditions in May 2016.

Cascading Dynamics of the Hydrologic Cycle in California Explored through Observations and Model Simulations	GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						drought; hydrologic cycle; GRACE; NLDAS; water depletion; California	LAND-SURFACE MODEL; GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; GRACE; STORAGE; ASSIMILATION; IRRIGATION	As drought occurs in a region it can have cascading effects through the water cycle. In this study, we explore the temporal co-evolution of various components of the hydrologic cycle in California from 2002 to 2018. We combine information from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) suite of models, and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) reservoir levels to analyze dynamics of Total Water Storage (TWS), soil moisture, snow pack, large reservoir storage, and ultimately, groundwater. For TWS, a trend of -2 cm/yr is observed during the entire time period of our analysis; however, this rate increases to about -5 cm/yr during drought periods (2006-2010 and 2012-2016). Results indicate that the majority of the loss in TWS is caused by groundwater depletion. Using proper error accounting, we are able to identify the start, the peak, and the ending of the drought periods for each individual water state variable in the study domain. We show that snow and soil moisture are impacted earlier and recover faster than surface water and groundwater. The annual and year-to-year dynamics shown in our results portray a clear cascading effect of the hydrologic cycle on the scale of 8-16 months.

Simple but robust calibration models between AOD and PM are therefore important for generating reliable PM exposures. We conduct an in-depth examination of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the AOD-PM2.5 relationship by leveraging data from the Distributed Regional Aerosol Gridded Observation Networks (DRAGON) field campaign where eight NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites were co-located with EPA Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring sites in California's Central Valley from November 2012 to April 2013. With this spatiotemporally rich data we found that linear calibration models (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 10.38 mu g/m(3)) were significantly improved when spatial (R-2 = 0.45, RMSE = 9.54 mu g/m(3)), temporal (R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 8.30 mu g/m(3)), and spatiotemporal (R-2 = 0.65, RMSE = 7.58 mu g/m(3)) functions were included. As a use-case we applied the best spatiotemporal model to convert space-borne MultiAngle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) AOD observations to predict PM2.5 over the region (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 8.42 mu g/m(3)). Our results imply that simple AERONET AOD-PM2.5 calibrations are robust and can be reliably applied to space-borne AOD observations, resulting in PM2.5 prediction surfaces for use in downstream applications.

This article presents an innovative approach for assessing mega-urban changes and their impact on the environment based on the use of decadal QuikSCAT (QSCAT) satellite data, acquired globally by the SeaWinds scatterometer over that period. The Dense Sampling Method (DSM) is applied to QSCAT data to obtain reliable annual infrastructure-based urban observations at a posting of similar to 1 km. The DSM-QSCAT data, along with different DSM-based change indices, were used to delineate the extent of the Beijing infrastructure-based urban area in each year between 2000 and 2009, and assess its development over time, enabling a physical quantification of its urbanization which reflects the implementation of various development policies during the same time period. Eventually, as a proxy for the impact of Beijing urbanization on the environment, the decadal trend of its infrastructure-based urbanization is compared with that of the corresponding tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column densities as observed from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) instrument aboard the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-2) between 2000 and 2002, and from the SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY aboard of the ESA's ENVIronmental SATellite (SCIAMACHY /ENVISAT) between 2003 and 2009. Results reveal a threefold increase of the yearly tropospheric NO2 column density within the Beijing infrastructure-based urban area extent in 2009, which had quadrupled since 2000.

Gemini Planet Imager H-band (1.65 mu m) polarimetric differential imaging reveals the highest signal-to-noise ratio detection of this ring yet attained and traces structure inward to 025 (28 au at a distance of 111 pc). The radial polarized intensity image shows the east side of the disk, peaking in intensity at 040 (44 au) and extending out to 09 (100 au). There is a spiral arm-like enhancement to the south, reminiscent of the known spiral structures on the outer rings of the disk. The location of the spiral arm is coincident with (CO)-C-12 J = 3-2 emission detected by ALMA and hints at a dynamically active inner circumstellar region. Our observations also show a portion of the middle dusty ring at similar to 220 au known from previous observations of this system. We fit the polarized H-band emission with a continuum radiative transfer Mie model. Our best-fit model favors an optically thin disk with a minimum dust grain size close to the blowout size for this system, evidence of ongoing dust production in the inner reaches of the disk. The thermal emission from this model accounts for virtually all of the far-infrared and millimeter flux from the entire HD 141569A disk, in agreement with the lack of ALMA continuum and CO emission beyond similar to 100 au. A remaining 8-30 mu m thermal excess a factor of similar to 2 above our model argues for an as-yet-unresolved warm innermost 5-15 au component of the disk.

These observations are part of a program to determine a series of accurate positions for the Saturn system barycenter in the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and to use these position measurements to improve our knowledge of Saturn's orbit in the planetary ephemeris. Our VLBA observations cover the full duration of the orbital phase of the Cassini mission, from Saturn orbit insertion in 2004 to the end of mission in 2017. This period covers more than one-third of Saturn's orbital period, allowing us to obtain good orbit constraints for Saturn, particularly on the inclination and ascending node longitude. During the early years of Cassini's orbital mission our VLBA data dominated the determination of orbit orientation, while later in the mission range measurements become more significant. The orientation of Saturn's orbit is now known to approximately 0.25 milli-arcseconds (1.25 nrad), an order of magnitude improvement since the start of Cassini observations. Continuing improvements in the ICRF position accuracy for our phase reference sources, and possible improvements in the final orbit solutions for Cassini, may lead to a still better Saturn orbit over the coming years.

Evaluating Climate Variability of the Canonical Hot-Jupiters HD 189733b and HD 209458b through Multi-epoch Eclipse Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet atmospheres; Exoplanet atmospheric variability; Exoplanet astronomy; Exoplanet structure	ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; TRANSMISSION SPECTRUM; EXTRASOLAR PLANET; LIGHT CURVES; HAZE; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSITS; SEARCH; WATER	Here we present the analysis of multi-epoch secondary eclipse observations of HD 189733b and HD 209458b as a probe of temporal variability in the planetary climate using both Spitzer channels 1 and 2 (3.6 and 4.5 mu m). We expect hot-Jupiter atmospheres to be dynamic environments exhibiting time varying weather. However, it is uncertain to what extent temporal variability will be observable when considering disk integrated observations. We do not detect statistically significant variability and are able to place useful upper limits on the infrared variability amplitudes in these atmospheres. There are very few planets with multi-epoch observations at the required precision to probe variability in dayside emission. The observations considered in this study span several years, providing insight into temporal variability at multiple timescales. In the case of HD 189733b, the best-fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of 1827 ppm and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about a median depth of 1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best-fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 22 ppm about a median depth of 1406 ppm, and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092 ppm. The precision and scatter in these observations allow us to constrain variability to less than (5.6% and 6.0%) and (12% and 1.6%) for channels (1, 2) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b, respectively.

Based on these new measurements, we perform a joint orbit fit to the available relative astrometry from ground-based imaging, the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data (IAD), and the Gaia DR2 position, and demonstrate how to incorporate the IAD into direct imaging orbit fits. We find a mass consistent with predictions of hot-start evolutionary models and previous works following similar methods, though with larger uncertainties: 12.8(-3.2)(+5.3) M-Jup. Our eccentricity determination of disfavors circular orbits. We consider orbit fits to several different imaging data sets, and find generally similar posteriors on the mass for each combination of imaging data. Our analysis underscores the importance of performing joint fits to the absolute and relative astrometry simultaneously, given the strong covariance between orbital elements. Time of conjunction is well-constrained within 2.8 days of 2017 September 13, with the star behind the planet's Hill sphere between 2017 April 11 and 2018 February 16 (18 days). Following the recent radial velocity detection of a second planet in the system, beta Pic c, we perform additional two-planet fits combining relative astrometry, absolute astrometry, and stellar radial velocities. These joint fits find a significantly smaller mass (8.0 2.6 M-Jup) for the imaged planet beta Pic b, in a somewhat more circular orbit. We expect future ground-based observations to further constrain the visual orbit and mass of the planet in advance of the release of Gaia DR4.

Uranus in Northern Midspring: Persistent Atmospheric Temperatures and Circulations Inferred from Thermal Imaging	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Atmospheric circulation; Uranus; Atmospheric science; Planetary atmospheres; Planetary science; Outer planets	MIDINFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; SPECTRUM; NEPTUNE; BALANCE; METHANE; SULFUR	We present results from mid-infrared imaging of Uranus at wavelengths of 13.0 and 18.7 mu m, sensing emission from the stratosphere and upper troposphere, acquired using the VISIR instrument at the Very Large Telescope, 2018 September 4-October 20. Using a combination of inverse and forward modeling, we analyze these northern midspring (L-s similar to 46 degrees) images and compare them to archival data to assess seasonal changes since the 1986 southern solstice and subsequent equinox. We find the data are consistent with little change (<0.3 K) in the upper tropospheric temperature structure, extending the previous conclusions of Orton et al. well past equinox, with only a subtle increase in temperature at the emerging north pole. Additionally, spatial-temporal variations in 13 mu m stratospheric emission are investigated for the first time, revealing meridional variation and a hemispheric asymmetry not predicted by models. Finally, we investigate the nature of the stratospheric emission and demonstrate that the observed distribution appears related and potentially coupled to the underlying tropospheric emission six scale heights below. The observations are consistent with either midlatitude heating or an enhanced abundance of acetylene. Considering potential mechanisms and additional observations, we favor a model of acetylene enrichment at midlatitudes resulting from an extension of the upper tropospheric circulation, which appears capable of transporting methane from the troposphere, through the cold trap, and into the stratosphere for subsequent photolysis to acetylene.

A Twilight Search for Atiras, Vatiras, and Co-orbital Asteroids: Preliminary Results	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Atira group; Near-Earth objects; Earth trojans; Sky surveys	NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS; ABSOLUTE-MAGNITUDE; COORBITAL MOTION; SOLAR-SYSTEM; OBJECTS; POPULATION	Near-Earth objects (NEOs) that orbit the Sun on or within Earth's orbit are tricky to detect for Earth-based observers due to their proximity to the Sun in the sky. These small bodies hold clues to the dynamical history of the inner solar system as well as the physical evolution of planetesimals in extreme environments. Populations in this region include the Atira and Vatira asteroids, as well as Venus and Earth co-orbital asteroids. Here we present a twilight search for these small bodies, conducted using the 1.2 m Oschin Schmidt and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera at Palomar Observatory. The ZTF twilight survey operates at solar elongations down to 35 degrees with a limiting magnitude of r = 19.5. During a total of 40 evening sessions and 62 morning sessions conducted between 2018 November 15 and 2019 June 23, we detected six Atiras, including two new discoveries, 2019 AQ(3) and 2019 LF6, but no Vatiras or Earth/Venus co-orbital asteroids. NEO population models show that these new discoveries are likely only the tip of the iceberg, with the bulk of the population yet to be found. The population models also suggest that we have only detected 5%-7% of the H < 20 Atira population over the seven month survey. Co-orbital asteroids are smaller in diameter and require deeper surveys. A systematic and efficient survey of the near-Sun region will require deeper searches and/or facilities that can operate at small solar elongations.

Expanding the Y Dwarf Census with Spitzer Follow-up of the Coldest CatWISE Solar Neighborhood Discoveries	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Brown dwarfs; Y dwarfs; Solar neighborhood; T dwarfs; Proper motions	SKY SURVEY; CAMERA; IRAC	We present Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 mu m follow-up of 170 candidate extremely cool brown dwarfs newly discovered via the combination of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and NEOWISE imaging at 3-5 mu m. CatWISE, a joint analysis of archival WISE and NEOWISE data, has improved upon the motion measurements of AllWISE by leveraging a >10x time baseline enhancement, from 0.5 yr (AllWISE) to 6.5 yr (CatWISE). As a result, CatWISE motion selection has yielded a large sample of previously unrecognized brown dwarf candidates, many of which have archival detections exclusively in the WISE 4.6 mu m (W2) channel, suggesting that they could be both exceptionally cold and nearby. Where these objects go undetected in WISE W1 (3.4 mu m), Spitzer can provide critically informative detections at 3.6 mu m. Of our motion-confirmed discoveries, 17 have a best-fit Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] color most consistent with spectral type Y. It is likely that CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8 (mu 13 yr(-1)) is the reddest, and therefore potentially coldest, member of our sample with a very uncertain [3.6]-[4.5] color of 3.71 0.44 mag. We also highlight our highest proper-motion discovery, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3, with mu 27 yr(-1). Given that the prior list of confirmed and presumed Y dwarfs consists of just 27 objects, the Spitzer follow-up presented in this work has substantially expanded the sample of identified Y dwarfs. Our new discoveries thus represent significant progress toward understanding the bottom of the substellar mass function, investigating the diversity of the Y dwarf population, and selecting optimal brown dwarf targets for James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopy.

The observations are deep enough to detect sources with z similar to 6. We identify three new robust line detections from a blind search of five deep fields centered on ultraluminous infrared galaxies and QSOs. We calculate the volume density of companions and find a relative overdensity of 6(-3)(+4) when comparing to current observational constraints and theoretical predictions, respectively. These results suggest that the central sources may be highly biased tracers of mass in the early universe. We find these companion lines to have comparable properties to other known galaxies at the same epoch. All companions lie less than 650 km s(-1) and between 25 and 60 kpc (projected) from their central source. To place these discoveries in context, we employ a mock galaxy catalog to estimate the luminosity function for [C ii] during reionization and compare to our observations. The simulations support this result by showing a similar level of elevated counts found around such luminous [C ii] sources.

Based on observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array Interferometer, the 1(1)-1(0) transition of molecular oxygen is the likely origin of the line with rest frequency close to 118.75 GHz. The velocity of the O-2 emission in Mrk 231 coincides with the red wing seen in CO emission, suggesting that it is associated with the outflowing molecular gas, located mainly at about 10 kpc away from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). This first detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen provides an ideal tool to study AGN-driven molecular outflows on dynamic timescales of tens of megayears. O-2 may be a significant coolant for molecular gas in such regions affected by AGN-driven outflows. New astrochemical models are needed to explain the implied high molecular oxygen abundance in such regions several kiloparsecs away from the center of galaxies.

J	Shen, ZY; Pressel, KG; Tan, ZH; Schneider, T				Shen, Zhaoyi; Pressel, Kyle G.; Tan, Zhihong; Schneider, Tapio			Statistically Steady State Large-Eddy Simulations Forced by an Idealized GCM: 1. Forcing Framework and Simulation Characteristics	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; SINGLE-COLUMN MODELS; AQUAPLANET MOIST GCM; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; SHALLOW CUMULUS; WIDE-RANGE; FEEDBACK; CLOUDS; APPROXIMATION; CIRCULATIONS	Using large-eddy simulations (LES) systematically has the potential to inform parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes in general circulation models (GCMs), such as turbulence, convection, and clouds. Here we show how LES can be run to simulate grid columns of GCMs to generate LES across a cross section of dynamical regimes. The LES setup approximately replicates the thermodynamic and water budgets in GCM grid columns. Resolved horizontal and vertical transports of heat and water and large-scale pressure gradients from the GCM are prescribed as forcing in the LES. The LES are forced with prescribed surface temperatures, but atmospheric temperature and moisture are free to adjust, reducing the imprinting of GCM fields on the LES. In both the GCM and LES, radiative transfer is treated in a unified but idealized manner (semigray atmosphere without water vapor feedback or cloud radiative effects). We show that the LES in this setup reaches statistically steady states without nudging to thermodynamic GCM profiles. The steady states provide training data for developing GCM parameterizations. The same LES setup also provides a good basis for studying the cloud response to global warming. Plain Language Summary Clouds and their feedbacks remain one of the largest uncertainties in predictions of future climate changes. High-resolution models can provide faithful simulations of clouds and their underlying turbulence in limited areas, but they have primarily been used in select locations, with limited success in reducing uncertainties in climate predictions. This study presents a framework for driving high-resolution simulations by a global climate model, which allows us to generate a library of high-resolution simulations across different cloud regimes. The framework leverages the potential of high-resolution models to improve parameterizations of clouds and turbulence in climate models and to better understand the cloud feedback mechanisms.

A continuum source is detected at the center of the nebula, elongated along the equatorial plane, likely tracing a dusty torus around the central source. Continuum emission is also detected on both sides of the central continuum source in the equatorial plane, probably resulting from interactions of collimated fast winds (CFWs) with envelope material in the equator. CO emission is detected along the optical lobe. Although the optical lobe appears as bipolar, the CO map shows that it is actually a quadrupolar outflow consisting of two overlapping bipolar outflows. Two additional younger bipolar outflows are also detected in CO, one at the lower latitude and the other along the equatorial plane. In the CO position-velocity maps, blueshifted absorption stripes are detected in the outflow emissions, due to absorption by a series of shells produced by a series of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind ejections. By modeling the morphology and kinematics of the AGB wind and outflows, we find that the AGB wind could have ended similar to 1300 yr ago, the quadrupolar outflow was ejected similar to 350 yr ago, and the two additional bipolar outflows were ejected similar to 280 and 200 yr ago, respectively. The outflows could be produced either by bullets coming from an explosion, or by a precessing CFW with a time-dependent ejection velocity.

This study investigates the three approaches of bias correction, i.e., linear scaling (LS), local intensity scaling (LOCI) and power transformation (PT), on the three advanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs), i.e., CMORPH, TRMM and PERSIANN over the Langat river basin, Malaysia by focusing on five selected extreme floods due to northeast monsoon season. Results found the LS scheme was able to match the mean precipitation of every SPP but does not correct standard deviation (SD) or coefficient of variation (CV) of the estimations regardless of extreme floods selected. For LOCI scheme, only TRMM and CMORPH estimations in certain floods have showed some improvement in their results. This might be due to the rainfall threshold set in correcting process. PT scheme was found to be the best method as it improved most of the statistical performances as well as the rainfall distribution of the floods. Sensitivity of the parameters used in the bias correction is also investigated. PT scheme is found to be least sensitive in correcting the daily SPPs compared to the other two schemes. However, careful consideration should be given for correcting the CMORPH and PERSIANN estimations.

Deep glacial troughs and stabilizing ridges unveiled beneath the margins of the Antarctic ice sheet	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article							WEST ANTARCTICA; THWAITES GLACIER; BED TOPOGRAPHY; PINE ISLAND; RETREAT; BATHYMETRY; GREENLAND; CLIMATE; SURFACE	The Antarctic ice sheet has been losing mass over past decades through the accelerated flow of its glaciers, conditioned by ocean temperature and bed topography. Glaciers retreating along retrograde slopes (that is, the bed elevation drops in the inland direction) are potentially unstable, while subglacial ridges slow down the glacial retreat. Despite major advances in the mapping of subglacial bed topography, significant sectors of Antarctica remain poorly resolved and critical spatial details are missing. Here we present a novel, high-resolution and physically based description of Antarctic bed topography using mass conservation. Our results reveal previously unknown basal features with major implications for glacier response to climate change. For example, glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains are protected by broad, stabilizing ridges. Conversely, in the marine basin of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, we find retrograde slopes along Ninnis and Denman glaciers, with stabilizing slopes beneath Moscow University, Totten and Lambert glacier system, despite corrections in bed elevation of up to 1 km for the latter. This transformative description of bed topography redefines the high- and lower-risk sectors for rapid sea level rise from Antarctica; it will also significantly impact model projections of sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries.

Perspectives, frontiers, and new horizons for plasma-based space electric propulsion	PHYSICS OF PLASMAS			English	Article							HEXABORIDE HOLLOW-CATHODE; ROTATING MAGNETIC-FIELD; HALL-THRUSTER; PERFORMANCE-CHARACTERISTICS; PARTICLE SIMULATION; ION; TEMPERATURE; POWER; TRANSPORT; OPERATION	There are a number of pressing problems mankind is facing today that could, at least in part, be resolved by space systems. These include capabilities for fast and far-reaching telecommunication, surveying of resources and climate, and sustaining global information networks, to name but a few. Not surprisingly, increasing efforts are now devoted to building a strong near-Earth satellite infrastructure, with plans to extend the sphere of active life to orbital space and, later, to the Moon and Mars if not further. The realization of these aspirations demands novel and more efficient means of propulsion. At present, it is not only the heavy launch systems that are fully reliant on thermodynamic principles for propulsion. Satellites and spacecraft still widely use gas-based thrusters or chemical engines as their primary means of propulsion. Nonetheless, similar to other transportation systems where the use of electrical platforms has expanded rapidly, space propulsion technologies are also experiencing a shift toward electric thrusters that do not feature the many limitations intrinsic to the thermodynamic systems. Most importantly, electric and plasma thrusters have a theoretical capacity to deliver virtually any impulse, the latter being ultimately limited by the speed of light. Rapid progress in the field driven by consolidated efforts from industry and academia has brought all-electric space systems closer to reality, yet there are still obstacles that need addressing before we can take full advantage of this promising family of propulsion technologies. In this paper, we briefly outline the most recent successes in the development of plasma-based space propulsion systems and present our view of future trends, opportunities, and challenges in this rapidly growing field.

Monte Carlo Evaluation of the Europa Clipper TID Margin Based on the Variability of the Jovian Radiation Environment With Application for Mission Design	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article								The Europa Clipper mission will repeatedly pass in and out of the Jovian radiation belts as it explores the icy moon. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of any safety margins for total ionizing dose (TID) ratings on Europa Clipper spacecraft components, the variability of the expected radiation environment must be considered. This study outlines a Monte Carlo calculation of the cumulative probability that the TID will deviate from the nominal value of 150 krad (Si) based on the lognormal distributions of electron fluxes observed in the Jupiter environment by the Galileo Energetic Particle Detector instrument. Our model shows that parts hardened to 300 krad (Si) for a radiation design factor of 2 are expected to withstand the measured variations of the Jupiter radiation environment with margin. This result can be scaled to apply to all parts and materials with different TID levels for the Europa Clipper mission.

In this work, we perform numerical simulations using the first-principles models Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) and Thermosphere-Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) to address the reliability of thermospheric-ionospheric forecasts. When considering forecasts applicable to periods of geomagnetic activity, careful consideration is required of model inputs, which largely determine how the models will simulate disturbed conditions. We adopt an approach to drive the models with solar wind parameters and the 10.7 cm solar radio flux. This aligns our investigation with recent research and operational activities to forecast solar wind conditions on the Earth a few days in advance. In this work, we examine a weak geomagnetic storm, the June 2012 high-speed-stream event, for which we drive GITM and TIE-GCM with observed solar wind and F10.7 values. We find general agreement between the simulations and observation-based Global Ionospheric Maps of the total electron content (TEC) response. However, overestimated TEC response is found in the middle to low latitudinal region of the American sector and surrounding areas for both GITM and TIE-GCM during similar time periods. By conducting numerical modeling experiments and comparing the modeling results with observational data, we find that the overestimated TEC response can be almost equally attributed to the solar wind driving and F10.7 driving during the June 2012 event. We conclude that the accuracy of the high-latitude electric field and the solar irradiance is crucial to reproduce the TEC response in forecastable-mode modeling.

The arms are counter-rotated to cancel the generation of magnetic fields in the quasi-static regime. The field equations are derived and verified to show the degradation of magnetic fields with minimal effects to the electric field. The long wire lengths give sinusoidal current distribution and fields that are not strongly dependent on the feed structure. As a result, the measured electro-quasi-static field agrees well with the dipole behavior over long ranges. In addition, the circuit model for the antenna is presented and verified with measurements.

J	Lowe, ST; Chew, C; Shah, J; Kilzer, M				Lowe, Stephen T.; Chew, Clara; Shah, Jesal; Kilzer, Michael			An Aircraft Wetland Inundation Experiment Using GNSS Reflectometry	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GNSS-R; terrestrial hydrology; soil moisture; biomass; remote sensing	SOIL-MOISTURE; SURFACE-WATER	In early May of 2017, a flight campaign was conducted over Caddo Lake, Texas, to test the ability of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to detect water underlying vegetation canopies. This paper presents data from that campaign and compares them to Sentinel-1 data collected during the same week. The low-altitude measurement allows for a more detailed assessment of the forward-scattering GNSS-R technique, and at a much higher spatial resolution, than is possible using currently available space-based GNSS-R data. Assumptions about the scattering model are verified, as is the assumption that the surface spot size is approximately the Fresnel zone. The results of this experiment indicate GNSS signals reflected from inundated short, thick vegetation, such as the giant Salvinia observed here, results in only a 2.15 dB loss compared to an open water reflection. GNSS reflections off inundated cypress forests show a 9.4 dB loss, but still 4.25 dB above that observed over dry regions. Sentinel-1 data show a 6-dB loss over the inundated giant Salvinia, relative to open water, and are insensitive to standing water beneath the cypress forests, as there is no difference between the signal over inundated cypress forests and that over dry land. These results indicate that, at aircraft altitudes, forward-scattered GNSS signals are able to map inundated regions even in the presence of dense overlying vegetation, whether that vegetation consists of short plants or tall trees.

However, the critical refraction, or ducting, caused by large refractivity gradients usually associated with the top of the stratocumulus clouds, can negatively bias the retrieved refractivity and humidity within the PBL. Previous research has shown that combining RO retrievals and the external information, such as collocated precipitable water (PW) estimates, can effectively reduce the negative bias and enhance the retrieval quality. Nevertheless, the requirement of collocated observations from other techniques limits the applicability of this reconstruction method in practice. Here, we describe an alternative approach that uses the coherent grazing signals from the same RO event that are reflected by the Earth's surface to remove the bias due to ducting. Additional observations are no longer necessary in this approach because the reflected signals provide the extra constraint. A least squares framework is used to select the candidate from a family of solutions wherein reflected bending angle best matches the corresponding observation. This new method was validated by both multiple phase screen (MPS) simulation and the simulated RO bending angle via forward Abel transform, and it was tested with the actual GPS-RO measurements. While, in general, the reflected bending retrieved from the current mission was noisy, the results show that this approach can potentially reduce the negative bias and improve RO observation within the PBL without assistance by the external information, such as PW.

However, it remains unknown how much gas could be released in a single event. We model the CH4 release by one mechanism for rapid release of CH4 from clathrate. By modeling how CH4-clathrate release is affected by changes in Mars' obliquity and atmospheric composition, we find that a large fraction of total outgassing from CH4 clathrate occurs following Mars' first prolonged atmospheric collapse. This atmosphere-collapse-initiated CH4-release mechanism has three stages. (1) Rapid collapse of Early Mars' carbon dioxide atmosphere initiates a slower shift of water ice from high ground to the poles. (2) Upon subsequent CO2-atmosphere re-inflation and CO2-greenhouse warming, low-latitude clathrate decomposes and releases methane gas. (3) Methane can then perturb atmospheric chemistry and surface temperature, until photochemical processes destroy the methane. Within our model, we find that under some circumstances a Titan-like haze layer would be expected to form, consistent with transient deposition of abundant complex abiotic organic matter on the Early Mars surface. We also find that this CH4-release mechanism can warm Early Mars, but special circumstances are required in order to uncork 10(17) kg of CH4, the minimum needed for strong warming. Specifically, strong warming only occurs when the fraction of the hydrate stability zone that is initially occupied by clathrate exceeds 10%, and when Mars' first prolonged atmospheric collapse occurs for atmospheric pressure >1 bar.

The largest contributors to the contamination are the vectors associated with the dislodgement and transport of terrestrial particles from the rover to the surrounding soil, since such particles can carry biological signatures. In this article, we report on the results of particle resuspension experiments performed to both guide and validate these models. In the experiments we employed several pairs of particles and substrates that included idealized microspheres, dust, and biological particles, on surfaces made of glass, kapton or aluminium. We also used a substrate coated with white paint, which exhibited the highest average surface roughness compared to all other substrates. We found that despite the higher relative roughness associated with 40-80 mu m dust particles on any of the substrates, the removal fractions of similar to 70-mu m glass microspheres from a glass substrate were the highest when they were subjected to the same (lateral) aerodynamic shear stress. We also found that when we exposed similar to 1-mu m biological and non-biological particles to the same aerodynamic shear stresses no removal occurred from a glass substrate. The shear stresses to which these particles were exposed were over three orders of magnitude higher than those associated with the mean wind speeds on Mars.

Soon after landing, a rover similar to Curiosity will acquire scientifically selected samples of martian material for possible return to Earth by a future mission. Naturally then, each sample must be kept clean of viable organisms with a terrestrial origin according to the stringent biological contamination requirements imposed on the mission. All known vectors that can lead to the contamination of the samples by terrestrial-borne particles must, therefore, first be evaluated before engineering solutions are devised to meet these requirements. One of the significant contributors to the biological contamination is associated with the dislodgment and transport of particles from the rover to the surrounding soil. It is also one of the most complex vectors since its assessment requires multi-disciplinary analyses involving, at minimum, fluid mechanics and the physics of particle adhesion and resuspension, from a multifarious rover geometry. Here we provide an overview of the models developed to capture these particle processes, followed by representative estimates of the concentrations of terrestrial viable organisms in the vicinity of the rover.

A mascon approach to estimating the depth of Jupiter's Great Red Spot with Juno gravity measurements	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Great red spot; Juno; Gravity science; Jupiter; Atmospheric dynamics; Orbit determination	FIELD; INTERIOR; TRACKING; SATURN; MODEL; JETS	We evaluate a method for determining the depth of Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) with two Jima overflights dedicated to gravity science. The small-scale, localized nature of the anticyclone requires a detection method where the gravity perturbations are regional. To this end, we model the GRS as a dipole of flat disk mass concentrations (mascons), separated along the radial direction of Jupiter. Thermal wind theory predicts such structure composed of two equal and opposite masses below the visible cloud tops, condition that is used to constrain our estimation algorithm. Furthermore, Juno radiometer observations of the GRS brightness temperature indicate the presence of anomalies of opposite sign at different depths. We present the results of both a covariance and recovery analyses of the simulated data, in terms of accuracy in the estimation of the GRS mass and depth of winds. The analyses are carried out using precise Doppler tracking of the Juno spacecraft and by posing constraints on the interior model of the vortex from theory. We find that, if the surface dynamics extend at least several hundred kilometers below the cloud tops, it is possible to resolve the mass concentrations using both gravity passes, and tie the mass to the vortex's depth through thermal wind.

Here, the performance of the Mole to reach the target depth, to avoid or overcome obstacles on its path, and its directional stability in the subsurface is elaborated. The different test beds and set ups are described and the results are presented. The deep penetration tests (DPT), with the purpose to reach the target depth, are the most important performance tests and therefore the results are investigated in more detail in section 2. Full functional tests (FFT), which showed the performance and degradation of the mechanism inside the Mole, are presented in section 3. Additional penetration and life cycle tests are described in section 4. The testing has demonstrated that the HP3 Mole meets all of its penetration requirements with margin.

For such a concept to be feasible, it must be shown that it is possible to distinguish actual changes in the atmospheric state from the variability induced by making observations at different Earth incidence angles (EIAs). To this end, we present a flexible and physical optimal estimation-based algorithm designed to retrieve profiles of atmospheric water vapor, cloud liquid water path, and cloud ice water path from cross-track PMW sounders. The algorithm is able to explicitly account for the dependence of forward model errors on EIA and atmospheric regime. When the algorithm is applied to data from the Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) CubeSat mission, its retrieved products are generally in agreement with those obtained from the similar but larger Microwave Humidity Sounder instrument. More importantly, when forward model brightness temperature offsets and assumed error covariances are allowed to change with EIA and sea surface temperature, view-angle-related biases are greatly reduced. This finding is confirmed in two ways: through a comparison with reanalysis data and by making use of brief periods in early 2019 during which the TEMPEST-D spacecraft was rotated such that its scan pattern was along track, allowing dozens of separate observations of any given atmospheric feature along the satellite's ground track.

The atmosphere-ocean systems increase in complexity from (a) a molecular atmosphere above a rough ocean surface (AOS-I model); to (b) a pure water body below a rough ocean surface (AOS-II model); to (c) a fully-coupled simple atmosphere-ocean system (AOS-III model) containing a molecular atmosphere, rough ocean surface, and pure water; to (d) a fully-coupled complex atmosphere-ocean system (AOS-IV model) that includes scattering by molecules, rough ocean surface, pure water, and hydrosols. Our wavelengths (350, 450, 550, and 650 nm) capture the ultraviolet-visible range. Our tables provide radiative transfer (RT) testbed results for atmosphere-ocean systems with an accuracy that surpasses the measurement accuracy of state-of-the-art polarimeters. To validate the accuracy of these tables we performed computations using three independent RT codes that provide deterministic numerical solutions for the RT equation. The agreement is 10(-5) for AOS-IV model, and 10(-6) for the other models. The degree of linear polarization computed by these RT codes differs by <= 0.2% for 15 isolated cases of tabulated reflectance values, and by <= 0.1% for all remaining cases. We also provide comparisons with results obtained by a stochastic RT code for AOS-I model. The agreement between the deterministic and stochastic results for this model is 10(-5) at TOA, and 10(-6) above the ocean surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Net water flux cannot be directly measured, and its estimates as a residual of individual surface flux components often suffer from mass conservation errors due to accumulated systematic biases of individual fluxes. Here, for the first time, we provide direct estimates of global NWF based on near-surface satellite soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites. We apply a recently developed analytical model derived via inversion of the linearized Richards' equation. The model is parsimonious, yet yields unbiased estimates of long-term cumulative NWF that is generally well correlated with the terrestrial water storage anomaly from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. In addition, in conjunction with precipitation and evapotranspiration retrievals, the resultant NWF estimates provide a new means for retrieving global infiltration and runoff from satellite observations. However, the efficacy of the proposed approach over densely vegetated regions is questionable, due to the uncertainty of the satellite soil moisture retrievals and the lack of explicit parameterization of transpiration by deeply rooted plants in the proposed model. Future research is needed to advance this modeling paradigm to explicitly account for plant transpiration.

Effect of Rainfall Events on SMAP Radiometer-Based Soil Moisture Accuracy Using Core Validation Sites	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY			English	Article						In situ atmospheric observations; Measurements; Microwave observations; Remote sensing; Satellite observations	PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; NETWORK; PRODUCT	Soil moisture retrieval is particularly challenging during and immediately after precipitation events because of the transient movement of water in the shallow subsurface. Conventional L-band microwave radiometer-based soil moisture products use algorithms that assume a static state and a constant vertical soil moisture distribution. This study assessed the retrieval performance of a SMAP radiometer-based soil moisture product during and immediately after rain events. The removal of the rain event samples systematically improved the unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) from 0.037 (all measurements) to 0.028 m(3) m(-3) (transitory measurements screened out), while the magnitude of the bias became larger (from -0.005 to -0.014 m(3) m(-3)); RMSE improved from 0.047 to 0.042 m(3) m(-3), and the Pearson correlation saw a minor positive change from 0.813 to 0.824. The results indicate that removing samples during the transitional period causes the comparison to improve, but also suggests that the true bias may be larger than the one estimated using all the samples. Furthermore, the results revealed that the effect was stronger for areas with high clay content. An assessment of the performance of the product during the rain events (overpass within 3 h from the start of the rain) showed that the ubRMSE degraded from the benchmarked 0.036 m(3) m(-3) (during no rain events at all) to 0.043 m(3) m(-3) (during rain). The results also showed that the bias became wetter, which is expected because SMAP sensed the water on the surface before propagating to the in situ sensors. SMAP maintains its soil moisture sensitivity even during rain events and screening of rain events may not be necessary to ensure sufficient soil moisture retrieval quality.

A multi-sensor approach to retrieve emissivity angular dependence over desert regions	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land surface emissivity; Anisotropy; Angular effects; TES; Multi-sensor	LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CANOPY DIRECTIONAL EMISSIVITY; THERMAL INFRARED EMISSIVITY; FILTER PHYSICAL RETRIEVAL; SKIN TEMPERATURE; MODIS; VALIDATION; PRODUCTS; REFLECTANCE; SEPARATION	Land surface emissivity is a directional quantity and most natural surfaces are anisotropic emitters. Experimental studies show that for homogeneous surfaces like bare soils, the emissivity decreases with view angle. Translation of the directionality of emissivity as obtained from experiments or models to satellite spatial scales of kilometers or more is challenging given the natural heterogeneity of the land surface at those scales. We propose a multi-sensor approach to retrieve TIR emissivity angular dependence from satellite observations. The method is based on simultaneous radiance measurements over stable and homogeneous targets, performed by multiple remote sensing platforms in low-earth orbit (MODIS/VIIRS) and geostationary orbits (SEVIRI) with different viewing configurations. In the case of homogeneous scenes, we assume that differences in observed brightness temperatures are exclusively due to differences in the atmospheric optical path and in surface emissivity within each view angle, as surface temperature is the same for both sensors. We then use radiative transfer simulations to derive the emissivity changes between the sensors due to the viewing position. It is shown that emissivity values decrease with view angle for all thermal infrared channels considered, with the highest variations for channel centered at 8.7 mu m, followed by 10.8 and 12.0 mu m, respectively. The MODIS MYD21 product agrees with the multi-sensor approach for the 8.7 mu m channel but shows negligible dependence on view angle for 10.8 and 12.0 mu m bands. Results suggest that the emissivity calibration curve used in the MYD21 algorithm restricts the retrieval of the full angular variation of emissivity at these channels. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed multi-sensor method is robust, with reduced impact of the uncertainty of the atmospheric correction on the retrieval. The impact of emissivity angular dependence on retrieved LST may be as high as 3.0 and 1.0 K, respectively, for the GSW and the TES algorithms for angles up to 65 degrees.

With the return to normal climatic conditions in 2017, tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks are expected to partly recover due to increased productivity, but the intensity and spatial distribution of this recovery are unknown. We used low-frequency microwave satellite data (L-VOD) to feature precise monitoring of AGC changes and show that the AGC recovery of tropical ecosystems was slow and that by the end of 2017, AGC had not reached predrought levels of 2014. From 2014 to 2017, tropical AGC stocks decreased by 1.3(1.2)(1.5)Pg C due to persistent AGC losses in Africa (-0.9(-1.1)(-0.8)Pg C) and America (-0.5(-0.6)(-0.4)Pg C). Pantropically, drylands recovered their carbon stocks to pre-El Nino levels, but African and American humid forests did not, suggesting carryover effects from enhanced forest mortality.

A basin-free spherical shape as an outcome of a giant impact on asteroid Hygiea	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							4 VESTA; SIMULATIONS; FLUIDIZATION; FAMILIES; FRACTURE; CERES	(10) Hygiea is the fourth largest main belt asteroid and the only known asteroid whose surface composition appears similar to that of the dwarf planet (1) Ceres(1,2), suggesting a similar origin for these two objects. Hygiea suffered a giant impact more than 2 Gyr ago(3) that is at the origin of one of the largest asteroid families. However, Hygeia has never been observed with sufficiently high resolution to resolve the details of its surface or to constrain its size and shape. Here, we report high-angular-resolution imaging observations of Hygiea with the VLT/SPHERE instrument (20 mas at 600 nm) that reveal a basin-free nearly spherical shape with a volume-equivalent radius of 217 +/- 7 km, implying a density of 1,944 +/- 250 kg m(-3) to 1 sigma. In addition, we have determined a new rotation period for Hygiea of 13.8 h, which is half the currently accepted value. Numerical simulations of the family-forming event show that Hygiea's spherical shape and family can be explained by a collision with a large projectile (diameter 75-150 km). By comparing Hygiea's sphericity with that of other Solar System objects, it appears that Hygiea is nearly as spherical as Ceres, opening up the possibility for this object to be reclassified as a dwarf planet.

Spiral structures in an embedded protostellar disk driven by envelope accretion	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							PROTOPLANETARY; STABILITY; SYSTEM; CORE	Hydrodynamical simulations show that a pair of spiral arms can form in the disk around a rapidly growing young star and that the arms are crucial in transporting angular momentum as the disk accretes material from the surrounding envelope(1-4). Here we report the detection of a pair of symmetric spiral structures in a protostellar disk, supporting the formation of spiral arms in the disk around a forming star. The HH 111 VLA 1 source is a young Class I source embedded in a massive infalling protostellar envelope and is actively accreting, driving the prominent HH 111 jet. Previous observations showed a ring of shock emission around the disk's outer edge(5), indicating accretion of the envelope material onto the disk at a high rate. Now with ALMA observations of thermal emission from dust particles, we detect a pair of spiral arms extending from the inner region to the disk's outer edge, similar to that seen in many simulations(1-4). Additionally, the disk is massive, with a Toomre Q parameter near unity in the outer parts where the spiral structures are detected, supporting the notion that envelope accretion is making the outer disk gravitationally unstable. In our observations, another source, HH 111 VLA 2, is spatially resolved for the first time, showing a disk-like structure with a diameter of similar to 26 au and an orientation nearly orthogonal to that of the HH 111 VLA 1 disk.

One promising approach is the use of high-performance in situ impact ionization mass spectrometers to sample water ice grains emerging from ocean-bearing moons such as Europa or Enceladus. A predecessor of such detectors, the Cosmic Dust Analyzer on board the Cassini spacecraft, has proven to be very successful in analyzing inorganic and organic ocean constituents and with that characterizing the habitability of Enceladus ocean. However, biosignatures have not been definitively identified in extraterrestrial ocean environments so far. Here, we investigate with an analog experiment the spectral appearance of amino acids, fatty acids, and peptides in water ice grains, together with their detection limits, as applicable to spaceborne mass spectrometers. We employ a laboratory-based laser induced liquid beam ion desorption technique, proven to simulate accurately the impact ionization mass spectra of water ice grains over a wide range of impact speeds. The investigated organics produce characteristic mass spectra, with molecular peaks as well as clearly identifiable, distinctive fragments. We find the detection limits of these key biosignatures to be at the mu M or nM level, depending on the molecular species and instrument polarity, and infer that impact ionization mass spectrometers are most sensitive to the molecular peaks of these biosignatures at encounter velocities of 4-6 km/s.

We report the detection of a co-moving companion around the K3IV star TYC 8998-760-1 (2MASSJ13251211-6456207) that is located at a distance of 94.6 +/- 0.3 pc using SPHERE/IRDIS on the VLT. Spectroscopic observations with VLT/X-SHOOTER constrain the mass of the star to 1.00 +/- 0.02 M-circle dot and an age of 16.7 +/- 1.4 Myr. The companion TYC 8998-760-1 b is detected at a projected separation of 1.71 '', which implies a projected physical separation of 162 au. Photometric measurements ranging from Y to M band provide a mass estimate of 14 +/- 3 M-jup by comparison to BT-Settl and AMES-dusty isochrones, corresponding to a mass ratio of q = 0.013 +/- 0.003 with respect to the primary. We rule out additional companions to TYC 8998-760-1 that are more massive than 12 M-jup and farther than 12 au away from the host. Future polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of this system with ground and space based observatories will facilitate testing of formation and evolution scenarios shaping the architecture of the circumstellar environment around this 'young Sun'.

ALMA reveals an isotropic outer disc inclination distribution for young dipper stars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						planet-star interactions; protoplanetary discs; binaries: visual; stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be	ROSSBY-WAVE INSTABILITY; ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEM; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; T-TAURI STARS; SCATTERED-LIGHT; AA TAU; ACCRETION; POPULATION; K2; SPECTROGRAPH	Dippers are a common class of young variable star exhibiting day-long dimmings with depths of up to several tens of per cent. A standard explanation is that dippers host nearly edge-on (i(d) approximate to 70 degrees) protoplanetary discs that allow close-in (<1 au) dust lifted slightly out of the mid-plane to partially occult the star. The identification of a face-on dipper disc and growing evidence of inner disc misalignments brings this scenario into question. Thus, we uniformly (re)derive the inclinations of 24 dipper discs resolved with (sub-)mm interferometry from ALMA. We find that dipper disc inclinations are consistent with an isotropic distribution over i(d) approximate to 0-75 degrees, above which the occurrence rate declines (likely an observational selection effect due to optically thick disc mid-planes blocking their host stars). These findings indicate that the dipper phenomenon is unrelated to the outer (>10 au) disc resolved by ALMA and that inner disc misalignments may be common during the protoplanetary phase. More than one mechanism may contribute to the dipper phenomenon, including accretion-driven warps and 'broken' discs caused by inclined (sub-)stellar or planetary companions.

The work builds up on a previous implementation of the code and extends its capabilities. The number of bodies handled is significantly increased through the use of a CUDA/GPU-parallel octree structure. The implementation of the code is discussed and its performance is compared against direct N-2 integration. The code features both smooth (force-based) and non-smooth (impulse-based) methods, as well as a visco-elastic non-smooth method, to handle contact interaction between bodies. The numerical problem of simulating 'rubble-pile' asteroid gravitational aggregation processes is addressed. We discuss the features of the problem and derive criteria to set up the numerical simulation from the dynamical constraints of the combined gravitational-collisional problem. Examples of asteroid aggregation scenarios that could benefit from such implementation are finally presented.

VLT/SINFONI study of black hole growth in high-redshift radio-loud quasars from the CARLA survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: high-redshift; quasars: supermassive black holes	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LINE REGION; MASSES; GALAXIES; LUMINOSITY; ACCRETION; EVOLUTION; SPECTRA; HISTORY; SIZE	We present Very Large Telescope/Spectrograph for INtegral Field Observations in the Near Infrared (VLT/SINFONI) observations of 35 quasars at 2.1 < z < 3.2, the majority of which were selected from the Clusters Around Radio-Loud AGN (CARLA) survey. CARLA quasars have large C-IV-based black hole masses (M-BH > 10(9) M-circle dot) and powerful radio emission (P-500MHz > 27.5 W Hz(-1)). We estimate H alpha-based M-BH, finding a scatter of 0.35 dex compared to C-IV. We evaluate several recipes for correcting CIV-based masses, which reduce the scatter to 0.24 dex. The radio power of the radio-loud quasars is at most weakly correlated with the interconnected quantities H alpha width, L-5100, and M-BH, suggesting that it is governed by different physical processes. However, we do find a strong inverse correlation between C IV blueshift and radio power linked to higher Eddington ratios and L-5100. Under standard assumptions, the black hole (BH) growth time is longer than the cosmic age for many CARLA quasars, suggesting that they must have experienced more efficient growth in the past. If these BHs were growing from seeds since the epoch of reionization, it is possible that they grew at the Eddington limit like the quasars at z similar to 6-7, and then continued to grow at the reduced rates observed until z similar to 2-3. Finally, we study the relation between M-BH and environment, finding a weak positive correlation between MBH and galaxydensity measured by CARLA.	[Marinello, M.; Overzier, R.

THOR 42: A touchstone similar to 24 Myr-old eclipsing binary spanning the fully convective boundary	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						binaries: eclipsing; binaries: spectroscopic; stars: evolution; stars: fundamental parameters; stars: low mass; stars: pre-main-sequence	LOW-MASS STARS; ABSOLUTE DIMENSIONS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; ACCURATE MASSES; OPEN CLUSTERS; BROWN DWARFS; ZERO POINTS; SEQUENCE; ROTATION; SYSTEMS	We present the characterization of CRTS J055255.7-004426 (=THOR 42), a young eclipsing binary comprising two pre-main sequence M dwarfs (combined spectral type M3.5). This nearby (103 pc), short-period (0.859 d) system was recently proposed as a member of the similar to 24 Myr-old 32 Orionis Moving Group. Using ground- and space-based photometry in combination with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy, we model the light and radial velocity curves to derive precise system parameters. The resulting component masses and radii are 0.497 +/- 0.005 and 0.205 +/- 0.002 M-circle dot, and 0.659 +/- 0.003 and 0.424 +/- 0.002 R-circle dot, respectively. With mass and radius uncertainties of similar to 1 per cent and similar to 0.5 per cent, respectively, THOR 42 is one of the most precisely characterized pre-main sequence eclipsing binaries known. Its systemic velocity, parallax, proper motion, colour-magnitude diagram placement, and enlarged radii are all consistent with membership in the 32 Ori Group. The system provides a unique opportunity to test pre-main sequence evolutionary models at an age and mass range not well constrained by observation. From the radius and mass measurements we derive ages of 22-26 Myr using standard (non-magnetic) models, in excellent agreement with the age of the group. However, none of the models can simultaneously reproduce the observed mass, radius, temperature, and luminosity of the coeval components. In particular, their H-R diagram ages are 2-4 times younger and we infer masses similar to 50 per cent smaller than the dynamical values.

Changing-state quasars	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; techniques: photometric; surveys; quasars: general	SYSTEMATIC SEARCH; LOCAL SIMULATIONS; AGN; DISKS	We present the results of a systematic search for quasars in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey exhibiting both strong photometric variability and spectroscopic variability over a decadal baseline. We identify 111 sources with specific patterns of optical and mid-infrared photometric behaviour and a defined spectroscopic change. These 'changing-state' quasars (CSQs) form a higher luminosity sample to complement existing sets of 'changing-look' AGNs and quasars in the literature. The CSQs (by selection) exhibit larger photometric variability than the changing-look quasars (CLQs). The spectroscopic variability is marginally stronger in the CSQs than CLQs as defined by the change in H beta/[O III] ratio. We find 48 sources with declining H beta flux and 63 sources with increasing H beta flux, and discover 8 sources with z > 0.8, further extending the redshift arm. Our CSQ sample compares to the literature CLQ objects in similar distributions of H beta flux ratios and differential Eddington ratios between high (bright) and low (dim) states. Taken as a whole, we find that this population of extreme varying quasars is associated with changes in the Eddington ratio and the time-scales imply cooling/heating fronts propagating through the disc.

Establishing a new technique for discovering large-scale structure using the ORELSE survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: photometric; techniques: spectroscopic; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: groups: general; galaxies: high-redshift	SIMILAR-TO 1; GALAXY CLUSTERS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; CL-1604 SUPERCLUSTER; DENSITY RELATION; LEGACY SURVEY; DARK-MATTER; DEEP SURVEY; TELESCOPE; I.	The Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign initially designed to study the effects of environment on galaxy evolution in high-redshift (z similar to 1) large-scale structures. We use its rich data in combination with a powerful new technique, Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo (VMC) mapping, to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at 0.55 < z < 1.37 within 15 ORELSE fields, a combined spectroscopic footprint of similar to 1.4 deg(2). Through extensive tests with both observational data and our own mock galaxy catalogues, we optimize the method's many free parameters to maximize its efficacy for general overdensity searches. Our overdensity search yielded 402 new overdensity candidates with precisely measured redshifts and an unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses (M-tot greater than or similar to 5 x 10(13) M-circle dot). Using the mock catalogues, we estimated the purity and completeness of our overdensity catalogue as a function of redshift, total mass, and spectroscopic redshift fraction, finding impressive levels of both 0.92/0.83 and 0.60/0.49 for purity/completeness at z = 0.8 and z = 1.2, respectively, for all overdensity masses at spectroscopic fractions of similar to 20 percent. With VMC mapping, we are able to measure precise systemic redshifts, provide an estimate of the total gravitating mass, and maintain high levels of purity and completeness at z similar to 1 even with only moderate levels of spectroscopy. Other methods (e.g. red-sequence overdensities and hot medium reliant detections) begin to fail at similar redshifts, which attests to VMC mapping's potential to be a powerful tool for current and future wide-field galaxy evolution surveys at z similar to 1 and beyond.

Type 1 versus type 2 AGN dichotomy from the point of view of ionized outflows	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; quasars: emission lines	SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; STAR-FORMATION; FEEDBACK; EMISSION; COEVOLUTION; QUASARS; GROWTH; MODEL	We present a detailed study of ionized outflows in a large sample of similar to 650 hard X-ray-detected active galactic neuclei (AGNs). Using optical spectroscopy from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we are able to reveal the faint wings of the [OIII] emission lines associated with outflows covering, for the first time, an unexplored range of low AGN bolometric luminosity at low redshift (z similar to 0.05). We test if and how the incidence and velocity of ionized outflow is related to AGN physical parameters: black hole mass (M-BH), gas column density (N-H), Eddington ratio (lambda(Edd)), [OIII], X-ray, and bolometric luminosities. We find a higher occurrence of ionized outflows in type 1.9 (55 per cent) and type 1 AGNs (46 per cent) with respect to type 2 AGNs (24 per cent). While outflows in type 2 AGNs are evenly balanced between blue and red velocity offsets with respect to the [OIII] narrow component, they are almost exclusively blueshifted in type 1 and type 1.9 AGNs. We observe a significant dependence between the outflow occurrence and accretion rate, which becomes relevant at high Eddington ratios [log(lambda(Edd)) greater than or similar to -1.7]. We interpret such behaviour in the framework of covering factor-Eddington ratio dependence. We do not find strong trends of the outflow maximum velocity with AGN physical parameters, as an increase with bolometric luminosity can be only identified when including samples of AGNs at high luminosity and high redshift taken from literature.

A pulsar-based time-scale from the International Pulsar Timing Array	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						time; pulsars: general	GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; MILLISECOND PULSAR; PRECISION; PACKAGE; TEMPO2; LIMITS; DISPERSION; NOISE; MODEL	We have constructed a new time-scale, TT(IPTA16), based on observations of radio pulsars presented in the first data release from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We used two analysis techniques with independent estimates of the noise models for the pulsar observations and different algorithms for obtaining the pulsar time-scale. The two analyses agree within the estimated uncertainties and both agree with TT(BIPM17), a post-corrected time-scale produced by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). We show that both methods could detect significant errors in TT(BIPM17) if they were present. We estimate the stability of the atomic clocks from which TT(BIPM17) is derived using observations of four rubidium fountain clocks at the US Naval Observatory. Comparing the power spectrum of TT(IPTA16) with that of these fountain clocks suggests that pulsar-based time-scales are unlikely to contribute to the stability of the best time-scales over the next decade, but they will remain a valuable independent check on atomic time-scales. We also find that the stability of the pulsar-based time-scale is likely to be limited by our knowledge of solar-system dynamics, and that errors in TT(BIPM17) will not be a limiting factor for the primary goal of the IPTA, which is to search for the signatures of nano-Hertz gravitational waves.

Using the image positions and flux ratios from eight quadruply imaged quasars, we constrain the free-streaming length of dark matter and the amplitude of the subhalo mass function (SHMF). We model both main deflector subhaloes and haloes along the line of sight, and account for warm dark matter free-streaming effects on the mass function and mass-concentration relation. By calibrating the scaling of the SHMF with host halo mass and redshift using a suite of simulated haloes, we infer a global normalization for the SHMF. We account for finite-size background sources, and marginalize over the mass profile of the main deflector. Parametrizing dark matter free-streaming through the half-mode mass m(hm), we constrain the thermal relic particle mass mDM corresponding to m(hm). At 95 per cent CI: m(hm) < 10(7.8) M-circle dot (m(DM) > 5.2 keV). We disfavour m(DM) = 4.0 keV and m(DM) = 3.0 keV with likelihood ratios of 7:1 and 30:1, respectively, relative to the peak of the posterior distribution. Assuming cold dark matter, we constrain the projected mass in substructure between 10(6) and 10(9) M-circle dot near lensed images. At 68 per cent CI, we infer 2.0-6.1 x 10(7) M-circle dot kpc(-2), corresponding to mean projected mass fraction (f) over bar (sub) = 0.03(-0.017)(+0.021). At 95 per cent CI, we obtain a lower bound on the projected mass of 0.6 x 10(7) M-circle dot kpc(-2), corresponding to (f) over bar (sub) > 0.005. These results agree with the predictions of cold dark matter.

A baseline Antarctic GIA correction for space gravimetry	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						glacial isostatic adjustment; Antarctic mass trend; space gravimetry; Bayesian statistics; sea level; GRACE corrections	GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; ICE-SHEET; SEA-LEVEL; MASS-BALANCE; GRACE; MODEL; VISCOSITY; RATES; ACCUMULATION; DEGLACIATION	Within the past decade, newly collected GPS data and geochronological constraints have resulted in refinement of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models for Antarctica. These are critical to estimating and understanding ice mass changes at present-day. A correction needs to be made when using space gravity for ice mass balance assessments due to the fact that any vertical movements of the solid Earth masquerade as changes in ice mass, and these must be carefully removed. The main upshot of the new Antarctic GIA models is a downward revision of negative ice mass trends deduced from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), resulting from a reduced GIA correction. This revision places GRACE inferred trend in mass balance within the one sigma uncertainty of mass balance deduced by altimetry. Because uncertainties in Holocene ice history and the low viscosity rheology beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) continue to vex further improvement in predictions of present-day GIA gravity rate, more emphasis has been given to regional-scale GIA models. Here we use a Bayesian method to explore the gravimetric GIA trend over Antarctica, both with and without the impact of a late Pleistocene Antarctic ice loads, along with the contribution of oceanic loads. We call this model without loads associated with Antarctica a baseline for regional GIA models to build upon. We consider variations of the radial mantle viscosity profile and the volume of continental-scale ice sheets during the last glacial cycle. The modeled baseline GIA is mainly controlled by the lower mantle viscosity and continental levering caused by ocean loading. We find that the predicted baseline GIA correction weakly depends on the ice history. This correction averages to +28.4 [16.5-41.9, 95% confidence] Gt/yr, of which +23.6 +/- 5.3 are contributed by East Antarctica. In contrast, with late-Pleistocene Antarctic-proximal ice included, the total modeled mass trend due to GIA is +73.7 [30.1-114.7] Gt/yr. A baseline GIA correction of 28.4 Gt/yr is of order 50% of the mean net mass trend measured during the period 1992-2017. The statistical analysis provides tools for properly synthesizing any regional Antarctic GIA model with a selfconsistent far-field component. This may prove important for accounting for both global and regional 3-D variations in Mantle viscosity. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have carried out a tower-based experiment with receivers to detect the reflected signals from the communications satellites at the Fraser Experimental Forests (FEFs), Colorado, in 2017. The measured reflectivity data at 260 MHz have a good correlation with in-soil moisture (SM) measurements. Retrieval of SM from the reflectivity data was also performed with results indicating accuracy of about 0.01 bias and 0.02 standard deviation (std) with respect to the average of SM in the upper 10 cm of soil. The experimental data and retrieval analyses lend support to the use of P-band SoOp for the remote sensing of SM. Our data also indicate the limitation of single frequency observations, suggesting the requirement of multiple frequencies to enable RZSM remote sensing because the surface SM plays a critical role on the change of reflectivity even at P-band frequencies.

This antenna is designed for telecommunication and is compatible with NASA's deep-space network (DSN) at X-band (i.e., uplink: 7.145-7.19 GHz; downlink: 8.4-8.45 GHz) and Ka-band frequencies (i.e., uplink: 34.2-34.7 GHz; downlink: 31.8-32.3 GHz). Three right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) antennas, both transmit and receive, are introduced here: X-band only, Ka-band only, and X-/Ka-band. For the X-band-only antenna, a gain of 36.1 and 36.8 dBic is achieved at uplink and downlink frequency bands, respectively. This translates into an aperture efficiency of 72% and 62%.

Joseph			Metric Learning for Approximation of Microwave Channel Error Covariance: Application for Satellite Retrieval of Drizzle and Light Snowfall	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Channel error covariance; metric learning; precipitation passive microwave retrievals; precipitation phase; satellite snowfall detection	LIQUID WATER; PRECIPITATION; ALGORITHM; RAINFALL; OCEAN; LAND; SENSITIVITY; RADIOMETER; RADAR	Improved microwave retrieval of land and atmospheric state variables requires proper weighting of the information content of radiometric channels through their error covariance matrix. Inspired by recent advances in metric learning techniques, a new framework is proposed for a formal approximation of the channel error covariance. The idea is tested for the detection of precipitation and its phase over oceans, using coincidences of passive/active data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and CloudSat satellites. The initial results demonstrate that the presented approach cannot only capture the known laws of radiative transfer equations, but also the surrogate signatures that can arise due to the co-occurrence of precipitation and other radiometrically active land-atmospheric state variables. In particular, the results demonstrate high precision (low error) for the low-frequency channels of 10-37 GHz in the detection of both rain and snowfall over oceans. Using the optimal estimate of the channel error covariance through the multi-frequency k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification approach, without any ancillary data, it is demonstrated that the probability of passive microwave detection of snowfall (0.97) can be higher than that of the rainfall (0.88), when drizzle and light snowfall are the dominant form of precipitation. This improvement is hypothesized to be largely related to the information content of the low-frequency channels of 10-37 GHz that can capture the co-occurrence of snowfall with an increased cloud liquid water content, sea ice, and wind-induced changes of surface emissivity.

Landsats 7 and 8 were launched on April 15, 1999 and February 11, 2013, respectively. The thermal channels of all three instruments have been validated at the Lake Tahoe, CA/NV, USA, and Salton Sea, CA, USA, automated validation sites. These sites have been used to validate a large number of thermal infrared radiometers including ASTER, MODIS, and VIIRS. We have validated 41 cloud-free ECOSTRESS scenes acquired between July 29, 2018 and June 23, 2019; 625 cloud-free Landsat 7 scenes acquired between June 30, 1999 and February 7, 2019; and 375 cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes acquired between March 10, 2013 and February 8, 2019. Validation involved propagating ground measurements to equivalent at-sensor (vicarious) values and comparing them to the measurements obtained from the sensor using its on-board calibration (OBC). The overall correlation between the in situ measurements and at-sensor radiance for the thermal channels from all three instruments was excellent with R-2 of 0.98-0.99 in all the spectral channels. All three instruments were shown to meet or improve on their preflight absolute radiometric accuracy requirement with absolute radiometric values of better than +/- 1 K at 300 K. All three instruments were also shown to have in-flight noise equivalent delta temperatures which were similar to their preflight values and between 0.1 and 0.3 K depending on the spectral channel.

We present a new ice thickness estimation model based on a mass-conserving forward model and a Bayesian inversion scheme. The forward model calculates flux in an elevation-band flow-line model, and translates this into ice thickness and surface ice speed using a shallow ice formulation. Both ice thickness and speed are then extrapolated to the map plane. The model assimilates observations of ice thickness and speed using a Bayesian scheme implemented with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which calculates estimates of ice thickness and their error. We illustrate the model's capabilities by applying it to a mountain glacier, validate the model using 733 glaciers from four regions with ice thickness measurements, and demonstrate that the model can be used for large-scale studies by fitting it to over 30 000 glaciers from five regions. The results show that the model performs best when a few thickness observations are available; that the proposed scheme by which parameter-knowledge from a set of glaciers is transferred to others works but has room for improvements; and that the inferred regional ice volumes are consistent with recent estimates.

The Y/Y-K colors of kappa And b are redder than field dwarfs, consistent with its youth and lower gravity. Empirical comparisons of its Y-band photometry and CHARIS spectrum to a large spectral library of isolated field dwarfs reaffirm the conclusion from Currie et al. that it likely has a low gravity but admit a wider range of most plausible spectral types (L0-L2). Our gravitational classification also suggests that the best-fit objects for kappa And b may have lower gravity than those previously reported. Atmospheric models lacking dust/clouds fail to reproduce its entire 1-4.7 mu m spectral energy distribution (SED), and cloudy atmosphere models with temperatures of similar to 1700-2000 K better match kappa And b data. Most well-fitting model comparisons favor 1700-1900 K, a surface gravity of log(g) similar to 4-4.5, and a radius of 1.3-1.6 R-Jup; the best-fit model (Drift-Phoenix) yields the coolest and lowest-gravity values: T-eff = 1700 K and log g = 4.0. An update to kappa And b's orbit with ExoSOFT using new astrometry spanning 7 yr reaffirms its high eccentricity (0.77 0.08). We consider a scenario where unseen companions are responsible for scattering kappa And b to a wide separation and high eccentricity. If three planets, including kappa And b, were born with coplanar orbits, and one of them was ejected by gravitational scattering, a potential inner companion with mass greater than or similar to 10 M-Jup could be located at less than or similar to 25 au.

Optimizing geophysical muon radiography using information theory	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Inverse theory; Probability distributions; Tomography	PRESSURE BUILDUP; CO2 INJECTION; PROPAGATION; SIMULATION; CAPACITY; STORAGE	Cosmic ray muons are highly penetrating, with some reaching several kilometres into solid rock. Consequently, muon detectors have been used to probe the interiors of large geological structures, by observing how the muon flux varies with direction of arrival. There is an increasing need to discriminate between materials differing only slightly in bulk density. A particularly demanding application is in monitoring underground reservoirs used for CO2 capture and storage, where bulk density changes of approximately 1 per cent are anticipated. Muon arrival is a random process, and it is the underlying expectation values, not the actual muon counts, which provide information on the physical parameters of the system. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between differences in muon counts due to real geological features, and those arising from random error. This is crucial in the low-contrast case, where the method can reach the information theoretic limit of what a data source can reveal, even in principle. To this end, methods to analyse information availability in low-contrast muon radiography have been developed, as have means to optimally interpret the available data, both for radiography and for tomography. This includes a method for calculating expectation values of muon flux for a given geological model directly, complementing existing Monte Carlo techniques. A case study, using a model of carbon capture is presented. It is shown that the new data analysis techniques have the potential to approximately double the effective sensitivity of the detectors.

Here we compute the asymptotic incoming trajectory of 2I/Borisov, based on both recent and pre-discovery data extending back to December 2018, using a range of force models that account for cometary outgassing. From Gaia DR2 astrometry and radial velocities, we trace back in time the Galactic orbits of 7.4 million stars to look for close encounters with 2I/Borisov. The closest encounter we find took place 910 kyr ago with the M0V star Ross 573, at a separation of 0.068 pc (90% confidence interval of 0.053-0.091 pc) with a relative velocity of 23 km s(-1). This encounter is nine times closer than the closest past encounter identified for the first interstellar object 1I/'Oumuamua. Ejection of 2I/Borisov via a three-body encounter in a binary or planetary system is possible, although such a large ejection velocity is unlikely to be obtained and Ross 573 shows no signs of binarity. We also identify and discuss some other recent close encounters, recognizing that if 2I/Borisov is more than about 10 Myr old, our search would be unlikely to find its parent system.

Hillock assisted p-type enhancement in N-polar GaN:Mg films grown by MOCVD	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ZN-DOPED GAN; MG; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; EFFICIENCY; EDGE	We report on the enhanced incorporation efficiency of magnesium dopants into facets of hexagonal hillock structures in N-polar GaN, studied by comparative analysis of GaN:Mg films grown by MOCVD on high and low hillock density GaN template layers. Total magnesium concentration in planar regions surrounding a hillock structure is comparable to that within hillock sidewall facets measured at 1.3x10(19)cm(-3) by atom probe tomography, and clustering of Mg atoms is seen in all regions of the film. Within individual hillock structures a decreased Mg cluster density is observed within hillock structures as opposed to the planar regions surrounding a hillock. Additionally, the Mg cluster radius is decreased within the hillock sidewall. The favorable incorporation of Mg is attributed to Mg dopants incorporating substitutionally for Ga during growth of semi-polar facets of the hillock structures. Enhanced p-type conductivity of GaN:Mg films grown on high hillock density template layers is verified by optical and electrical measurement.

Although metallic lithium is generally absent in lithium-ion cells, certain conditions, particularly charging at low temperature and/or at high rate, can lead to lithium metal plating on the surface rather than intercalating into the carbon anode. Metallic lithium reacts with the electrolyte and forms dendrites upon continuous plating, which can lead to cell shorting and capacity loss. The type of carbon anode, electrolyte, and solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) all influence this behavior. SEI stabilizing additives are generally detrimental to low temperature charging performance, however, 0.1 M LiFSI was found to be advantageous to low temperature charging. When charged at a C/5 rate to 4.10 V, lithium plating was evident at similar to 20 degrees C higher temperature with VC and LiBOB additives compared to the baseline electrolyte without any additives (plating appears at -10 degrees C rather than -30 degrees C with the baseline electrolyte). In contrast, the cell containing 0.10 M LiFSI as an additive did not display lithium plating until -40 degrees C, or 10 degrees C lower than the baseline cell. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

A double peak in the seasonality of California's photosynthesis as observed from space	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; ECOSYSTEM RESPIRATION; SENTINEL-5 PRECURSOR; SATELLITE; RETRIEVAL; CANOPY; SIMULATIONS; RESOLUTION	Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to be a powerful proxy for photosynthesis and gross primary productivity (GPP). The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF from space. Here, we present a downscaling method to obtain 500m spatial resolution SIF over California. We report daily values based on a 14 d window. TROPOMI SIF data show a strong correspondence with daily GPP estimates at AmeriFlux sites across multiple ecosystems in California. We find a linear relationship between SIF and GPP that is largely invariant across ecosystems with an intercept that is not significantly different from zero. Measurements of SIF from TROPOMI agree with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation index (NIRv) - at annual timescales but indicate different temporal dynamics at monthly and daily timescales. TROPOMI SIF data show a double peak in the seasonality of photosynthesis, a feature that is not present in the MODIS vegetation indices. The different seasonality in the vegetation indices may be due to a clear-sky bias in the vegetation indices, whereas previous work has shown SIF to have a low sensitivity to clouds and to detect the downregulation of photosynthesis even when plants appear green. We further decompose the spatiotemporal patterns in the SIF data based on land cover. The double peak in the seasonality of California's photosynthesis is due to two processes that are out of phase: grasses, chaparral, and oak savanna ecosystems show an April maximum, while evergreen forests peak in June. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis corroborates the phase offset and spatial patterns driving the double peak. The EOF analysis further indicates that two spatiotemporal patterns explain 84% of the variability in the SIF data. Results shown here are promising for obtaining global GPP at sub-kilometer spatial scales and identifying the processes driving carbon uptake.

Observed CTH and PBLHN match most closely in the stratocumulus and stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition region, but CTH becomes lower than PBLHN since not all trade cumulus clouds reach the inversion. Simulated CTH and PBLHN are too shallow, but clouds with a new subgrid low cloud parameterization, Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CAM5-CLUBB), have a reduced bias, with the CTH-PBLHN distribution from Hi-Res CAM5-CLUBB, the most similar to observations.

To do so, we train a deep neural network to take as input a signal + noise dataset (drawn from the astrophysical source-parameter prior and the sampling distribution of detector noise), and to output a parametrized approximation of the corresponding posterior. We rely on a compact representation of the data based on reduced-order modeling, which we generate efficiently using a separate neural-network waveform interpolant [A. J. K. Chua, C. R.

Indigenous and exogenous organics and surface-atmosphere cycling inferred from carbon and oxygen isotopes at Gale crater	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							QUADRUPOLE MASS-SPECTROMETER; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; MARS; FRACTIONATION; EVOLUTION; RATIOS; CO2; INSTRUMENT; ADSORPTION; MOLECULES	The pyrolysis experiments of the SAM instrument on board the Curiosity rover reconstruct the origin of organics at Gale crater. Some of them come from meteorites, but others have been formed in situ, with widespread past formation of carbonates via cryogenesis. More than 0.5 bar of CO2 might have precipitated from the atmosphere. Since landing at Gale crater, Mars, in August 2012, the Curiosity rover has searched for evidence of past habitability, such as organic compounds, which have proved elusive to previous missions. We report results from pyrolysis experiments by Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument, focusing on the isotopic compositions of evolved CO2 and O-2, which provide clues to the identities and origins of carbon- and oxygen-bearing phases in surface materials. We find that O-2 is enriched in O-18 (delta O-18 about 40 parts per thousand). Its behaviour reflects the presence of oxychlorine compounds at the Martian surface, common to aeolian and sedimentary deposits. Peak temperatures and isotope ratios (delta O-18 from -61 +/- 4 parts per thousand to 64 +/- 7 parts per thousand; delta C-13 from -25 +/- 20 parts per thousand to 56 +/- 11 parts per thousand) of evolved CO2 indicate the presence of carbon in multiple phases. We suggest that some organic compounds reflect exogenous input from meteorites and interplanetary dust, while others could derive from in situ formation processes on Mars, such as abiotic photosynthesis or electrochemical reduction of CO2. The observed carbonate abundances could reflect a sink for about 425-640 millibar of atmospheric CO2, while an additional 100-170 millibar could be stored in oxalates formed at the surface. In addition, oxygen isotope ratios of putative carbonates suggest the possibility of widespread cryogenic carbonate formation during a previous era.	[Franz, H. B.; Mahaffy, P.

Reactivity of Metabolic Intermediates and Cofactor Stability under Model Early Earth Conditions	ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES			English	Article						Acetyl coenzyme a; TCA cycle; Oxaloacetate; Metabolism; Early earth	PARTIAL MOLAL PROPERTIES; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CITRIC-ACID; OXALOACETIC ACID; HIGH-PRESSURES; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; MINERAL PHOTOELECTROCHEMISTRY; OXIDATIVE DECARBOXYLATION; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; PREBIOTIC SYNTHESES	Understanding the emergence of metabolic pathways is key to unraveling the factors that promoted the origin of life. One popular view is that protein cofactors acted as catalysts prior to the evolution of the protein enzymes with which they are now associated. We investigated the stability of acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl Co-A, the group transfer cofactor in citric acid synthesis in the TCA cycle) under early Earth conditions, as well as whether Acetyl Co-A or its small molecule analogs thioacetate or acetate can catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group onto oxaloacetate in the absence of the citrate synthase enzyme. Several different temperatures, pH ranges, and compositions of aqueous environments were tested to simulate the Earth's early ocean and its possible components; the effect of these variables on oxaloacetate and cofactor chemistry were assessed under ambient and anoxic conditions. The cofactors tested are chemically stable under early Earth conditions, but none of the three compounds (Acetyl Co-A, thioacetate, or acetate) promoted synthesis of citric acid from oxaloacetate under the conditions tested. Oxaloacetate reacted with itself and/or decomposed to form a sequence of other products under ambient conditions, and under anoxic conditions was more stable; under ambient conditions the specific chemical pathways observed depended on the environmental conditions such as pH and presence/absence of bicarbonate or salt ions in early Earth ocean simulants. This work demonstrates the stability of these metabolic intermediates under anoxic conditions. However, even though free cofactors may be stable in a geological environmental setting, an enzyme or other mechanism to promote reaction specificity would likely be necessary for at least this particular reaction to proceed.

Analysis of formation and growth of the sigma phase in additively manufactured functionally graded materials	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Metals and alloys; Intermetallics; Laser processing; Microstructure; Thermodynamic modeling; Kinetics	304L STAINLESS-STEEL; TRANSITION JOINTS; TI-6AL-4V; TITANIUM; 304-STAINLESS-STEEL; ALLOY	This study focuses on the formation of the sigma phase in three functionally graded material (FGM) systems made by additive manufacturing (AM): stainless steel 420 (SS420) to V to Ti-6Al-4V, Ti-6Al-4V to V to stainless steel 304 L (SS304L), and SS420 to V. Directly joining Ti-6Al-4V and stainless steel may result in the formation of brittle Fe-Ti intermetallics. This study investigates the potential use of V as an intermediate element between terminal alloys of Ti-6Al-4V and stainless steel. Experimental analysis of the elemental and phase composition revealed that different amounts of s phase were present in the three FGM systems at locations with similar elemental compositions. Computational studies were performed to simulate the thermal history, phase transformation kinetics, and s phase growth within these FGMs. The computations suggested that, at the conditions studied, the s phase should nucleate faster and grow to a larger volume fraction in the SS420-V alloy than the SS304L-V alloy, contrasting with experimental observations. Instead, experimental analysis confirmed that the disparate growth of s phase in the FGMs was due differences in cracking during fabrication, resulting in different amounts of time spent at the elevated temperatures conducive to s phase growth in each of the samples.

The data assimilation simultaneously optimizes both concentrations and emissions of multiple species through ingestion of a suite of measurements (ozone, NO2, CO, HNO3) from multiple satellite sensors. In spite of substantial model differences, the observational density and accuracy was sufficient for the assimilation to reduce the multi-model spread by 20 %-85% for ozone and annual mean bias by 39 %-97% for ozone in the middle troposphere, while simultaneously reducing the tropospheric NO2 column biases by more than 40% and the negative biases of surface CO in the Northern Hemisphere by 41 %-94 %. For tropospheric mean OH, the multi-model mean meridional hemispheric gradient was reduced from 1.32 +/- 0.03 to 1.19 +/- 0.03, while the multi-model spread was reduced by 24 %-58% over polluted areas. The uncertainty ranges in the a posteriori emissions due to model errors were quantified in 4 %-31% for NOx and 13 %-35% for CO regional emissions. Harnessing assimilation increments in both NOx and ozone, we show that the sensitivity of ozone and NO2 surface concentrations to NOx emissions varied by a factor of 2 for end-member models, revealing fundamental differences in the representation of fast chemical and dynamical processes. A systematic investigation of model ozone response and analysis increment in MOMO-Chem could benefit evaluation of future prediction of the chemistry-climate system as a hierarchical emergent constraint.

The mission plans to observe the far side of the Moon from an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) libration point orbit. The EQUULEUS trajectory design needs to react to uncertainties of mission design parameters such as the launch conditions, errors, and thrust levels. The main challenge is to quickly design science orbits at EML2 and low-energy transfers from the post-deployment trajectory to the science orbits within the CubeSat's limited propulsion capabilities. To overcome this challenge, we develop a systematic trajectory design approach that 1) designs over 13,000 EML2 quasi-halo orbits in a full-ephemeris model with a statistical stationkeeping cost evaluation, and 2) identifies families of low-energy transfers to the science orbits using lunar flybys and solar perturbations. The approach is successfully applied for the trajectory design of EQUULEUS.

J	Freeman, A				Freeman, Anthony			Exploring our solar system with CubeSats and SmallSats: the dawn of a new era	CEAS SPACE JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						CubeSats; SmallSats; Deep Space Missions		We are on the threshold of a new era in robotic exploration of our solar system, one in which CubeSats and SmallSats will play an important role. As the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s lead center for robotic solar system exploration, JPL has a strategic interest in these new capabilities that enable planetary scientists to expand our knowledge of how our solar system formed, how it works, and even how life originated. In November 2018, JPL's two Mars Cube One (MarCO) spacecraft, launched with the InSight Discovery mission, made history as they flew past Mars. This first pair of interplanetary CubeSats navigated their way independently to Mars to provide a relay capability for the InSight lander back to Earth. Lunar Flashlight and Near-Earth Asteroid Scout, two CubeSats that are currently under development, will form part of the 'swarm' of CubeSats escorted onto a lunar trajectory by NASA's Artemis-1 mission-the first launch of its new Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. This paper provides an overview of these and other CubeSat and SmallSat mission developments at JPL from the author's perspective. It is intended to inspire others to follow the trail blazed by these pioneering missions.

We model thermal evolution and water-rock differentiation of small ice-rock objects that accreted at different heliocentric distances, while also considering migration into the asteroid belt for Ceres. We investigate how water-rock separation and various cooling processes influence Ceres' structure and its thermal conditions at present. We also draw conclusions about the presence of liquids and the possibility of cryovolcanism. Methods. We calculated energy balance in bodies heated by radioactive decay and compaction-driven water-rock separation in a three-component dust-water/ice-empty pores mixture, while also taking into consideration second-order processes, such as accretional heating, hydrothermal circulation, and ocean or ice convection. Calculations were performed for varying accretion duration, final size, surface temperature, and dust/ice ratio to survey the range of possible internal states for precursors of Ceres. Subsequently, the evolution of Ceres was considered in five sets of simulated models, covering different accretion and evolution orbits and dust/ice ratios. Results. We find that Ceres' precursors in the inner solar system could have been both wet and dry, while in the Kuiper belt, they retain the bulk of their water content. For plausible accretion scenarios, a thick primordial crust may be retained over several Gyr, following a slow differentiation within a few hundreds of Myr, assuming an absence of destabilizing impacts. The resulting thermal conditions at present allow for various salt solutions at depths of less than or similar to 10 km. The warmest present subsurface is obtained for an accretion in the Kuiper belt and migration to the present orbit. Conclusions. Our results indicate that Ceres' material could have been aqueously altered on small precursors. The modeled structure of Ceres suggests that a liquid layer could still be present between the crust and the core, which is consistent with Dawn observations and, thus, suggests accretion in the Kuiper belt. While the crust stability calculations indicate crust retention, the convection analysis and interior evolution imply that the crust could still be evolving.

Full orbital solution for the binary system in the northern Galactic disc microlensing event Gaia16aye	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; techniques: photometric; binaries: general; stars: individual: Gaia16aye-L	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; III EWS DATABASE; MASS MEASUREMENT; OPTICAL DEPTH; FIELD; TELESCOPE; PLANET; DISCOVERY; LENSES; CALIBRATION	Gaia16aye was a binary microlensing event discovered in the direction towards the northern Galactic disc and was one of the first microlensing events detected and alerted to by the Gaia space mission. Its light curve exhibited five distinct brightening episodes, reaching up to I = 12 mag, and it was covered in great detail with almost 25 000 data points gathered by a network of telescopes. We present the photometric and spectroscopic follow-up covering 500 days of the event evolution. We employed a full Keplerian binary orbit microlensing model combined with the motion of Earth and Gaia around the Sun to reproduce the complex light curve. The photometric data allowed us to solve the microlensing event entirely and to derive the complete and unique set of orbital parameters of the binary lensing system. We also report on the detection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and Gaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from microlensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two main-sequence stars with masses 0.57 +/- 0.05 M-circle dot and 0.36 +/- 0.03 M-circle dot at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity of 0.30. We also predict the astrometric microlensing signal for this binary lens as it will be seen by Gaia as well as the radial velocity curve for the binary system. Events such as Gaia16aye indicate the potential for the microlensing method of probing the mass function of dark objects, including black holes, in directions other than that of the Galactic bulge. This case also emphasises the importance of long-term time-domain coordinated observations that can be made with a network of heterogeneous telescopes.	[Wyrzykowski, L.; Mroz, P.; Rybicki, K.

NANOGrav Collaboration	The NANOGrav 11 yr Data Set: Limits on Gravitational Wave Memory	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Gravitational waves; Millisecond pulsars; Astronomy data analysis	PULSAR-TIMING PACKAGE; BURSTS; SEARCHES; TEMPO2	The mergers of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) promise to be incredible sources of gravitational waves (GWs). While the oscillatory part of the merger gravitational waveform will be outside the frequency sensitivity range of pulsar timing arrays, the nonoscillatory GW memory effect is detectable. Further, any burst of GWs will produce GW memory, making memory a useful probe of unmodeled exotic sources and new physics. We searched the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11 yr data set for GW memory. This data set is sensitive to very low-frequency GWs of similar to 3 to 400 nHz (periods of similar to 11 yr-1 month). Finding no evidence for GWs, we placed limits on the strain amplitude of GW memory events during the observation period. We then used the strain upper limits to place limits on the rate of GW memory causing events. At a strain of 2.5 x 10(-14), corresponding to the median upper limit as a function of source sky position, we set a limit on the rate of GW memory events at eta M similar to 2 x 10(10) iota = pi/3 at a distance of 1 Gpc. As a test of our analysis, we analyzed the NANOGrav 9 yr data set as well. This analysis found an anomolous signal, which does not appear in the 11 yr data set. This signal is not a GW, and its origin remains unknown.	[Aggarwal, K.; Brook, P. R.; Burke-Spolaor, S.; Ellis, J. A.; Garver-Daniels, N.; Gentile, P.; Lam, M. T.; Lorimer, D. R.; Madison, D.

X-1, an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate, and X-2, an ultraluminous X-ray pulsar. Here, we present a broadband X-ray spectral analysis of both sources based on 10 simultaneous observations made with Chandra and NuSTAR. Chandra provides the high spatial resolution to resolve the crowded field in the 0.5-8 keV band, and NuSTAR provides the sensitive hard X-ray spectral data, extending the bandpass of our study above 10 keV. These observations, taken in 2015-2016, cover a period of flaring from X-1, allowing us to study the spectral evolution of this source with luminosity. During four of these observations, X-2 was found to be at a low flux level, allowing an unambiguous view of the emission from X-1. We find that the broadband X-ray emission from X-1 is consistent with that seen in other ULXs observed in detail with NuSTAR, with a spectrum that includes a broadened disk-like component and a high-energy tail. We find that the luminosity of the disk scales with inner disk temperature as L proportional to T-3/2, contrary to expectations of a standard accretion disk and previous results. These findings rule out a thermal state for sub-Eddington accretion, and therefore do not support M82 X-1 as an IMBH candidate. We also find evidence that the neutral column density of the material in the line of sight increases with <CDATA <i , perhaps due to an increased mass outflow with accretion rate. For X-2, we do not find any significant spectral evolution, but we find the spectral parameters of the phase-averaged broadband emission are consistent with the pulsed emission at the highest X-ray luminosities.

Antarctic Ice Sheet and emission scenario controls on 21st-century extreme sea-level changes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RISE; AMBIGUITY; THWAITES	Uncertainties in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios and Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) melt propagate into uncertainties in projected mean sea-level (MSL) changes and extreme sea-level (ESL) events. Here we quantify the impact of RCP scenarios and AIS contributions on 21st-century ESL changes at tide-gauge sites across the globe using extreme-value statistics. We find that even under RCP2.6, almost half of the sites could be exposed annually to a present-day 100-year ESL event by 2050. Most tropical sites face large increases in ESL events earlier and for scenarios with smaller MSL changes than extratropical sites. Strong emission reductions lower the probability of large ESL changes but due to AIS uncertainties, cannot fully eliminate the probability that large increases in frequencies of ESL events will occur. Under RCP8.5 and rapid AIS mass loss, many tropical sites, including low-lying islands face a MSL rise by 2100 that exceeds the present-day 100-year event level.

ALMA and NACO observations towards the young exoring transit system J1407 (V1400 Cen)	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: pre-main sequence; submillimeter: planetary systems; planets and satellites: formation; protoplanetary disks; planet-disk interactions; planets and satellites: gaseous planets	GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; LIMITS; DISCS; DUST; NAOS; 1ST	Aims. Our aim was to directly detect the thermal emission of the putative exoring system responsible for the complex deep transits observed in the light curve for the young Sco-Cen star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen, hereafter J1407), confirming it as the occulter seen in May 2007, and to determine its orbital parameters with respect to the star. Methods. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the field centred on J1407 in the 340 GHz (Band 7) continuum in order to determine the flux and astrometric location of the ring system relative to the star. We used the VLT/NACO camera to observe the J1407 system in March 2019 and to search for the central planetary mass object at thermal infrared wavelengths. Results. We detect no point source at the expected location of J1407, and derive an upper limit 3 sigma level of 57.6 mu Jy. There is a point source detected at an angular separation consistent with the expected location for a free-floating ring system that occulted J1407 in May 2007, with a flux of 89 mu Jy consistent with optically thin dust surrounding a massive substellar companion. At 3.8 mu m with the NACO camera, we detect the star J1407 but no other additional point sources within 1.3 arcsec of the star, with a lower bound on the sensitivity of 6 M-Jup at the location of the ALMA source, and down to 4 M-Jup in the sky background limit. Conclusions. The ALMA upper limit at the location of J1407 implies that a hypothesised bound ring system is composed of dust smaller than 1 mm in size, implying a young ring structure. The detected ALMA source has multiple interpretations, including: (i) it is an unbound substellar object surrounded by warm dust in Sco-Cen with an upper mass limit of 6 M-Jup, or (ii) it is a background galaxy.

By reflecting the incoming solar radiation before it reaches the surface, the Arctic clouds may prevent the surface from absorbing tremendous solar radiation due to the reduced sea ice. This cloud effect will lead to intervene the feedback relation between the solar radiation and the sea ice change. However, few studies have quantitatively investigated the Arctic cloud effect on the ice-albedo feedback. This study found that the Arctic clouds regulate the melting speed of sea ice in midsummer months (June to August) based on the data from multiple sources, that is, satellite, reanalysis, and climate models. During this period, the fraction of Arctic clouds with the net radiative cooling effect is almost invariable with sea ice reduction. However, despite of the steady cloud fraction in the midsummer months, the shortwave cloud radiative effect (total-sky minus clear-sky absorbed shortwave radiation) was found to significantly increase with the reduced sea ice concentration (0.64 W m(-2)%(-1) in CERES, 0.73 W m(-2)%(-1) in ERA5). This is because the clouds present more contrast of albedo with the sea ice-free ocean than the sea ice-covered ocean. Finally, our analyses show that the Arctic clouds are nearly halving the strength of the ice-albedo feedback in the midsummer months. These results imply that the sea ice reduction could have been much faster in the past decades in the absence of the cloud effect found here.

The assay is based on a time-gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores. Germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore. EGA and heterotrophic plate counting (HPC) were used to evaluate the swab/rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces. EGA and HPC results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility. Dosage-dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat, UV irradiation, oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments, measured with EGA and HPC. EGA is a fast and complementary method to traditional HPC for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces. This work introduces and validates a 15-minute or faster assay for germinable endospores to complement the conventional lengthy, culture-based surface sterility validation, which is critical in hospitals, food and pharmaceutical industries to help minimize nosocomial infection, food spoilage, and pharmaceutical contamination.

J	Chakraborty, S; Jiang, JH; Su, H; Fu, R				Chakraborty, Sudip; Jiang, Jonathan H.; Su, Hui; Fu, Rong			Deep Convective Evolution From Shallow Clouds Over the Amazon and Congo Rainforests	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							WESTERN EQUATORIAL AFRICA; TROPICAL OCEANS; CLIMATE; BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; DISCRIMINATION; VALIDATION; ATMOSPHERE; ALGORITHM	Using satellite measurements from A-Train constellation and Global Precipitation Measurement mission, we investigate the relationships between the afternoon time shallow convective top height (CTHafternoon) and the evening time deep convective storm top height (CTHevening) and rain rate (RRevening) over the Amazon and Congo regions. We use CloudSat cloud type stratus and stratocumulus as the shallow afternoon clouds. Our results indicate that the afternoon shallow clouds over the Congo region are associated with suppressed and weakened evening time deep convection, whereas shallow clouds over the Amazon region are associated with the growth of the evening time deep convection. Over the Congo region, we find that as CTHafternoon increases, shallow convective rain rate in the afternoon (RRafternoon) increases. As a result, the evening time convective available potential energy (CAPE) as well as free tropospheric humidity (RH700-300) decrease. Consequently, condensation occurring inside deep convection reduces and CTHevening as well as RRevening decrease over there. Over the Amazon region, however, RRafternoon does not vary significantly with CTHafternoon. As CTHafternoon increases, CAPE, RH700-300, and condensation occurring inside deep convection increase in the evening. As a result, deep convective CTHevening and RRevening increase with CTHafternoon over the Amazon basin. These dissimilarities in the ambient condition drive the shallow to deep convective evolution differently over these two rainforests. On the other hand, shallow clouds that remain shallow in the evening are associated with less CAPE and RH700-300, RRafternoon, and RRevening. Although CAPE and RH700-300 promote deep convection to a height cloud top height, high vertical wind shear inhibits deep convection.

Maximum Southwest Greenland Ice Sheet Recession in the Early Holocene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; DISKO BUGT REGION; WEST GREENLAND; BAFFIN-ISLAND; JAKOBSHAVN-ISFJORD; LAST DEGLACIATION; THERMAL MAXIMUM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SISIMIUT AREA; RETREAT	Establishing the timing of maximum Holocene warmth in the Arctic is critical for understanding global climate system response to external forcing. In Greenland, challenges in obtaining climate records that span the full Holocene have hampered efforts to robustly identify when the Holocene Thermal Maximum occurred. Reconstructing land-based ice sheet history can fill this gap because these ice sheet regions respond sensitively to summer temperature. We synthesize new and published Be-10 and C-14 ages from southwest Greenland to map Greenland ice sheet margin positions from 12 to 7 ka and calculate retreat rates from 12 to 0 ka. We found that maximum Greenland ice sheet recession occurred between similar to 10.4 and 9.1 ka. Our reconstruction suggests that summer air temperatures in southwest Greenland were highest from similar to 10.4 to 9.1 ka, providing support for an early regional Holocene Thermal Maximum. These results can serve as benchmarks for comparison with ice sheet and climate model simulations.	[Lesnek, A. J.] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Earth Sci, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Briner, J.

Aspects of Pulsar Navigation for Deep Space Mission Applications	JOURNAL OF THE ASTRONAUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Pulsar; Navigation; Integer ambiguity resolution; Covariance analysis	X-RAY PULSARS; AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION; TIMING PACKAGE; TEMPO2; MODEL	This paper investigates the performance of pulsar-based navigation in deep space mission applications. The noise properties of X-ray based and radio-baspulsar measurements are examined and compared. A closed form parametric covariance analysis tool was developed in this study. It provides a rough estimate of the navigation performance associated with a deep space cruise that makes use of ion thrusters and sequential pulsar observations. In addition, the flight trajectory of the Dawn spacecraft was used to form a hypothetical deep space mission scenario that utilizes pulsars as navigation beacons. This simulated scenario accounts for clock uncertainty, pulsar timing noise, maneuver execution errors, sequential observation and interruptions between pulsar observations. A particle filter was implemented to reduce the large initial position uncertainty by resolving the number of pulsar wavelengths between the spacecraft and the Solar System Barycenter. The resulting position and velocity uncertainties from the particle filter can be used to initialize an Extended Kalman Filter, which estimates the spacecraft position and velocity for steady state operations.

It is, however, difficult to quantify transpiration from ecosystems due to measurement limitations. Direct eddy covariance (EC) measurements are currently the best available approach to observe interactions linked to biosphere-atmosphere CO2 and water vapor exchange. While there are well-established methods to partition CO2 fluxes into the component fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration, there is still no standardized method to partition water vapor fluxes (evapotranspiration, ET) into the component fluxes of evaporation and transpiration. In this study, we used two years of concurrent below and above canopy EC measurements in a mixed deciduous forest in Switzerland to partition water vapor fluxes into the components of transpiration (biological) and evaporation (physical). We compare our results with transpiration from the ecosystem demographic (ED2) model as well as derived from plot-level sap flow measurements. EC-derived transpiration accounted on average for 74% of ET, emphasizing a considerably lower contribution from evaporation. EC and sap flow measurements showed mid-afternoon reductions in transpiration during periods of high vapor pressure deficit in summer. Reductions in ET and transpiration were found under limiting soil moisture conditions, while the ratio of transpiration to ET remained constant over the years due to the low and rather constant evaporation in this closed canopy forest. Stomatal regulation in response to enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand was also found under water-stressed conditions in the afternoon in summer. When comparing our EC-derived evaporation with the ED2 model, we found large discrepancies linked to the challenge of modeling evaporation in a light limited, yet variable environment below the canopy. A strong correlation was found for transpiration from ED2 with the EC-based estimates. Our results show the potential of concurrent below and above canopy EC measurements to partition ecosystem ET in forests.

Post-large earthquake seismic activities mediated by aseismic deformation processes	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						afterslip; viscoelastic relaxation; aftershocks; geodetic time series analysis; variational Bayesian independent; component analysis; seismic clustering	SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; POSTSEISMIC DEFORMATION; UPPER-MANTLE; RELAXATION; AFTERSLIP; IDENTIFICATION; AFTERSHOCKS; MECHANISMS; RHEOLOGY; CATALOG	Two aseismic deformation processes are commonly invoked to explain the transient geodetic surface displacements that follow a major earthquake: afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation. Both induce time dependent stress variations in the crust, potentially affecting aftershock occurrence. However, the two mechanisms' relative impacts on crustal deformation and seismicity remain unclear. We find for the case of the 2010 M-w 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC) earthquake not only that afterslip likely drove clustered seismicity after the earthquake, but also that long-range earthquake interactions were likely modulated by viscoelastic relaxation at large scales in space (>5 times the fault rupture length) and time (>7 yr). This has important implications for the study of the "seismic cycle" and for seismic hazard estimation, since post-seismic deformation related to a single M-w 7.2 earthquake affects interseismic velocities and regional seismicity rates for more than a decade.

Mineralogy and density models for the silicate part of the icy satellites cores were assessed assuming a carbonaceous chondritic (CI) bulk composition and using a free-energy minimization code and experiments. Densities of other components, solid and liquid sulfides, carbonaceous matter, were evaluated from available equations of state. Model densities for silicates are larger than assessed from magnesian terrestrial minerals, by 200 to 600 kg.m(-3) for the hydrated silicates, and 300 to 500 kg.m(-3) for the dry silicates, due to the high iron bulk concentration in CI. The stability of Na-phlogopite in the silicate fraction up to 1300 K favors the trapping of most K-40 in the rocky/carbonaceous cores with important consequences for modeling of the thermal evolution of icy satellites. We find that CI density models of icy satellite cores taking into account only the silicate and metal/sulfide fraction cannot account for the observed densities and reduced moment of inertia of Titan and Ganymede without adding a lower density component. We propose that this low-density component is carbonaceous matter derived from insoluble organic matter, in proportion of similar to 30-40% in volume and 15-20% in mass. This proportion is compatible with contributions from CI and comets, making these primitive bodies including their carbonaceous matter component likely precursors of icy moons, and potentially of most of the objects formed behind the snow line of the solar system.

Observations and numerical modelling of a convective disturbance in a large-scale cyclone in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter; Atmospheres; Dynamics	MOIST CONVECTION; EPIC SIMULATIONS; ZONAL WINDS; NONLINEAR SIMULATIONS; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; 2009-2010 FADE; VOYAGER; GALILEO; JET; VARIABILITY	Moist convective storms in Jupiter develop frequently and can trigger atmospheric activity of different scales, from localized storms to planetary-scale disturbances including convective activity confined inside a larger meteorological system. In February 2018 a series of convective storms erupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from -23 degrees to -29.5 degrees). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic region known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval BA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The initial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring turbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of clouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent activity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them closely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west. Here we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily observations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations obtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical simulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the phenomenology observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay between the Ghost, the convective eruptions and Oval, and they demonstrate that water moist convection was the source of the initial storms. A simple scale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the planet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that most of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia.

Infrared detection of aliphatic organics on a cometary nucleus	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							WATER ICE; MATTER; ORIGIN; SPECTROSCOPY; EVOLUTION; SURFACE; SPECTROMETER; CONSTRAINTS; CHONDRITES; 81P/WILD-2	The European Space Agency's Rosetta mission(1) has acquired unprecedented measurements of the surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter, 67P), the composition of which, as determined by in situ and remote-sensing instruments, including the VIRTIS instrument(2), seems to be an assemblage of ices, minerals and organic material(3). We performed a refined analysis of infrared observations of the nucleus of 67P carried out by the VIRTIS-M hyperspectral imager. We find that the overall shape of the infrared spectrum of 67P is similar to that of other carbon-rich outer Solar System objects, suggesting a possible genetic link with them. More importantly, we also confirm the complex spectral structure of the wide 2.8-3.6 mu m absorption feature populated by fainter bands. Among these, we unambiguously identify the presence of aliphatic organics by their ubiquitous 3.38 mu m, 3.42 mu m and 3.47 mu m bands. This infrared detection of aliphatic species on a cometary surface has strong implications for the evolutionary history of the primordial Solar System and is evidence that comets provide an evolutionary link between interstellar material and Solar System bodies(4). A refined analysis of infrared observations of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from the VIRTIS instrument on board the Rosetta spacecraft has revealed the presence of aliphatic organic molecules on the comet nucleus.

(704) Interamnia: a transitional object between a dwarf planet and a typical irregular-shaped minor body	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual: (704) Interamnia; methods: observational; techniques: high angular resolution; techniques: photometric	ASTEROID LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; 52 EUROPA; MASSES; POLE; MODELS; SPINS; SIZE	Context. With an estimated diameter in the 320-350 km range, (704) Interamnia is the fifth largest main belt asteroid and one of the few bodies that fills the gap in size between the four largest bodies with D > 400 km (Ceres, Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea) and the numerous smaller bodies with diameter <= 200 km. However, despite its large size, little is known about the shape and spin state of Interamnia and, therefore, about its bulk composition and past collisional evolution. Aims. We aimed to test at what size and mass the shape of a small body departs from a nearly ellipsoidal equilibrium shape (as observed in the case of the four largest asteroids) to an irregular shape as routinely observed in the case of smaller (D <= 200 km) bodies. Methods. We observed Interamnia as part of our ESO VLT/SPHERE large program (ID: 199.C-0074) at thirteen different epochs. In addition, several new optical lightcurves were recorded. These data, along with stellar occultation data from the literature, were fed to the All-Data Asteroid Modeling algorithm to reconstruct the 3D-shape model of Interamnia and to determine its spin state. Results. Interamnia's volume-equivalent diameter of 332 6 km implies a bulk density of rho = 1.98 +/- 0.68 g cm(-3), which suggests that Interamnia - like Ceres and Hygiea - contains a high fraction of water ice, consistent with the paucity of apparent craters. Our observations reveal a shape that can be well approximated by an ellipsoid, and that is compatible with a fluid hydrostatic equilibrium at the 2 sigma level. Conclusions. The rather regular shape of Interamnia implies that the size and mass limit, under which the shapes of minor bodies with a high amount of water ice in the subsurface become irregular, has to be searched among smaller (D <= 300 km) less massive (m <= 3 x 10(19) kg) bodies.

Most Hot DOGs in this sample are narrow-line-dominated AGNs (type 1.8 or higher) and have higher Balmer decrements than typical type 2 quasars. Almost all (8/9) sources show evidence for ionized gas outflows in the form of broad and blueshifted [O iii] profiles, and some sources have such profiles in H alpha (5/7) or [O ii] (3/6). Combined with the literature, these results support additional sources of obscuration beyond the simple torus invoked by AGN unification models. Outflow rates derived from the broad [O iii] line (greater than or similar to 10(3) M yr(-1)) are greater than the black hole accretion and star formation rates, with feedback efficiencies (similar to 0.1%-1%) consistent with negative feedback to the host galaxy's star formation in merger-driven quasar activity scenarios. We find that the broad emission lines in luminous, obscured quasars are often better explained by outflows within the narrow-line region and caution that black hole mass estimates for such sources in the literature may have substantial uncertainty. Regardless, we find lower bounds on the Eddington ratio for Hot DOGs near unity.

O-2- and CO-rich Atmospheres for Potentially Habitable Environments on TRAPPIST-1 Planets	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Extrasolar rocky planets; Habitable planets; Super Earths; Habitable zone; Exoplanet atmospheres; Astrobiology	TERRESTRIAL PLANETS; NITROGEN-OXIDES; EARTHS; BIOSIGNATURES; CHEMISTRY; CLIMATE; OXYGEN	Small exoplanets of nearby M-dwarf stars present the possibility of finding and characterizing habitable worlds within the next decade. TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool M-dwarf star, was recently found to have seven Earth-sized planets of predominantly rocky composition. The planets e, f, and g could have a liquid water ocean on their surface given appropriate atmospheres of N-2 and CO2. In particular, climate models have shown that the planets e and f can sustain a global liquid water ocean, for >= 0.2 bar CO2 plus 1 bar N-2, or >= 2 bar CO2, respectively. These atmospheres are irradiated by ultraviolet emission from the star's moderately active chromosphere, and the consequence of this irradiation is unknown. Here we show that chemical reactions driven by the irradiation produce and maintain more than 0.2 bar O-2 and 0.05 bar CO if the CO2 is >= 0.1 bar. The abundance of O-2 and CO can rise to more than 1 bar under certain boundary conditions. Because of this O-2-CO runaway, habitable environments on the TRAPPIST-1 planets entail an O-2- and CO-rich atmosphere with coexisting O-3. The only process that would prevent runaway is direct recombination of O-2 and CO in the ocean, a reaction that is facilitated biologically. Our results indicate that O-2, O-3, and CO should be considered together with CO2 as the primary molecules in the search for atmospheric signatures from temperate and rocky planets of TRAPPIST-1 and other M-dwarf stars.

Using the ACS General Catalog (ACS-GC) as our initial sample, we select an AGN subsample using Spitzer and Chandra data along with their respective established AGN selection criteria. We then gather further multiwavelength photometric data in order to construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Using these SEDs, we are able to derive multiple AGN and host galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR), AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and nuclear column density. From these data, we show that AGN host galaxies tend to lie below the star-forming main sequence, with X-ray-selected AGN host galaxies being more offset than IR-selected AGN host galaxies. This suggests that there is some process, possibly negative feedback, in AGN host galaxies causing decreased star formation. We also demonstrate that there is a positive trend between the SFR and AGN luminosity in AGN host galaxies, in individual redshift bins, and across all redshift bins, and that both are correlated with the stellar mass of their galaxies. This points toward an underlying link between the stellar mass, stellar growth, and supermassive black hole growth in a galaxy.	[Stemo, Aaron; Comerford, Julia M.; Barrows, R.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to determine the radio morphologies of extended radio sources and the properties of their host galaxies in 50 massive galaxy clusters at z similar to 1. We find a majority of the radio morphologies to be Fanaroff-Riley type IIs. By analyzing the infrared counterparts of the radio sources, we find that similar to 40% of the host galaxies are the candidate brightest cluster galaxy and similar to 83% are consistent with being one of the top six most massive galaxies in the cluster. We investigate the role of environmental factors on the radio-loud AGN population by examining correlations between environmental and radio-galaxy properties. We find that the highest stellar mass hosts (M-* greater than or similar to 4 x 10(11) M) are confined to the cluster center and host compact jets. There is evidence for an increase in the size of the jets with cluster-centric radius, which may be attributed to the decreased ICM pressure confinement with increasing radius. Besides this correlation, there are no other significant correlations between the properties of the radio-AGN (luminosity, morphology, or size) and environmental properties (cluster richness and location within the cluster). The fact that there are more AGN in the cluster environment than the field at this epoch, combined with the lack of strong correlation between galaxy and environmental properties, argues that the cluster environment fosters radio activity but does not solely drive the evolution of these sources at this redshift.

A Method Demonstration with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							POWER SPECTRUM; COSMIC DAWN; CALIBRATION; SIGNAL; LIMIT	We present a study of internal reflection and cross-coupling systematics in Phase I of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). In a companion paper, we outlined the mathematical formalism for such systematics and presented algorithms for modeling and removing them from the data. In this work, we apply these techniques to data from HERA's first observing season as a method demonstration. The data show evidence for systematics that, without removal, would hinder a detection of the 21 cm power spectrum for the targeted Epoch of Reionization (EoR) line-of-sight modes in the range 0.2 h(-1) Mpc(-1) h(-1) Mpc(-1). In particular, we find evidence for nonnegligible amounts of spectral structure in the raw autocorrelations that overlaps with the EoR window and is suggestive of complex instrumental effects. Through systematic modeling on a single night of data, we find we can recover these modes in the power spectrum down to the integrated noise floor, achieving a dynamic range in the EoR window of 10(6) in power (mK(2) units) with respect to the bright galactic foreground signal. Future work with deeper integrations will help determine whether these systematics can continue to be mitigated down to EoR levels. For future observing seasons, HERA will have upgraded analog and digital hardware to better control these systematics in the field.

The dust continuum image shows a dust gap-ring structure in the outer region of the dust disk. A faint dust ring is also detected around 120 au beyond the dust gap. The CO isotopologue lines indicate that the gas disk is more extended than the dust disk. The peak brightness temperature of the (CO)-C-13 line shows a small bump around 130 au, while (CO)-C-12 lines do not. We investigate two possible mechanisms for reproducing the observed dust gap-ring structure and a gas temperature bump. First, the observed gap structure can be opened by a Jupiter-mass planet using the relation between the planet mass and the gap depth and width. Meanwhile, the radiative transfer calculations based on the observed dust surface density profile show that the observed dust ring could be formed by dust accumulation at the gas temperature bump, that is, the gas pressure bump produced beyond the outer edge of the dust disk.

Our 89 mu m polarimetric imaging of NGC 1068 with the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera/Polarimeter (HAWC+) on NASAs Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) also sheds light on magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the galaxy's inner-bar and active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find correlations between the 89 mu m magnetic field vectors and other tracers of spiral arms, and a symmetric polarization pattern as a function of the azimuthal angle arising from the projection and inclination of the disk field component in the plane of the sky. The observations can be fit with a logarithmic spiral model with pitch angle of and a disk inclination of 48 degrees 2 degrees. We infer that the bulk of the interstellar medium from which the polarized dust emission originates is threaded by a magnetic field that closely follows the spiral arms. Inside the central starburst disk (<1.6 kpc), the degree of polarization is found to be lower than for far-infrared sources in the Milky Way, and has minima at the locations of most intense star formation near the outer ends of the inner-bar. Inside the starburst ring, the field direction deviates from the model, becoming more radial along the leading edges of the inner-bar.

Improved Infrared Photometry and a Preliminary Parallax Measurement for the Extremely Cold Brown Dwarf CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article								We present follow-up Spitzer observations at 3.6 mu m (ch1) and 4.5 mu m (ch2) of CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8, one of the coldest known brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. This object was found by mining the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and NEOWISE data via the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog by Meisner et al., where an initial Spitzer color of ch1-ch2 = 3.71 0.44 mag was reported, implying it could be one of the reddest, and hence coldest, known brown dwarfs. Additional Spitzer data presented here allows us to revise its color to ch1-ch2 = 2.986 0.048 mag, which makes CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8 the fifth reddest brown dwarf ever observed. A preliminary trigonometric parallax measurement, based on a combination of WISE and Spitzer astrometry, places this object at a distance of Spitzer color and preliminary parallax, CWISEP J144606.62-231717.8 has a T-eff in the 310-360 K range. Assuming an age of 0.5-13 Gyr, this corresponds to a mass between 2 and 20 M-Jup.	[Marocco, Federico; Eisenhardt, Peter R.

Evidence for H2 Dissociation and Recombination Heat Transport in the Atmosphere of KELT-9b	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Hot Jupiters; Exoplanet atmospheres	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; HOT; IRRADIATION; CURVES	Phase curve observations provide an opportunity to study the energy budgets of exoplanets by quantifying the amount of heat redistributed from their daysides to their nightsides. Theories of phase curves for hot Jupiters have focused on the balance between radiation and dynamics as the primary parameter controlling heat redistribution. However, recent phase curves have shown deviations from the trends that emerge from this theory, which has led to work on additional processes that may affect hot Jupiter energy budgets. One such process, molecular hydrogen dissociation and recombination, can enhance energy redistribution on ultra-hot Jupiters with temperatures above similar to 2000 K. In order to study the impact of H-2 dissociation on ultra-hot Jupiters, we present a phase curve of KELT-9b observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 mu m. KELT-9b is the hottest known transiting planet, with a 4.5 mu m dayside brightness temperature of <CDATA<i and a nightside temperature of <CDATA<i. We observe a phase curve amplitude of 0.609 0.020 and an offset of <CDATA<i. The observed amplitude is too small to be explained by a simple balance between radiation and advection. General circulation models (GCMs) and an energy balance model that include the effects of H-2 dissociation and recombination provide a better match to the data. The GCMs, however, predict a maximum phase offset of 5 degrees, which disagrees with our observations at >5 sigma confidence. This discrepancy may be due to magnetic effects in the planet's highly ionized atmosphere.

Miniature high-speed, low-pulse-energy picosecond Raman spectrometer for identification of minerals and organics in planetary science	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							SWITCHED MICROCHIP LASER; IN-SITU; SPECTROSCOPY; FLUORESCENCE; MARS; ROVER	The motivation behind time-resolved Raman spectroscopy for planetary surface exploration is (1) to provide comprehensive identification of minerals (nearly all rock-forming minerals and weathering products) and many organics of prime importance including fossilized carbonaceous materials; (2) to do so ensuring that it is possible to characterize even the most sensitive materials that would be altered by current state-of-the-art pulsed lasers (e.g., dark minerals, organics). These goals are accomplished here using a lightweight, high-speed (MHz) pulsed ( < 100 ps) Raman spectrometer based on a high-speed microchip laser combined with a single photon avalanche diode detector array. Using a Mars analog sample set and an automated grid sampling technique, we demonstrate consistent identification of major minerals and kerogen detection at similar to >= 1% by volume, without losses typically associated with the two biggest problems: fluorescence interference and sample damage. Despite improvements, we find that time-resolved Raman spectroscopy is still limited by the availability of a suitable laser and detector. As technology advances and such devices become available, we expect that this technique will hold an important place in Raman spectroscopy for both commercial and planetary science applications. We also discuss the utility of Raman point mapping for planetary science (e.g., in comparison with other common techniques like infrared reflectance spectroscopy) and conclude that the choice of technique must be planetary mission-specific; one must consider whether incurring the time to map single microscopic points is worthwhile, and how many points would be sufficient to gain the required information to characterize the surface.

Transition Metal Phosphorous Trisulfides as Cathode Materials in High Temperatures Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						High temperature; battery; metal phosphorus trisulfide; cathode; primary	FEW-LAYER NIPS3; HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; HOLLOW MICROSPHERES; REACTION-MECHANISM; FEPS3 ELECTRODES; FES2 CATHODE; LITHIUM; PERFORMANCE; DISCHARGE; VENUS	The challenging environment of high temperature and high pressure on the Venus surface limit the battery options for Venus landers and surface probes. High temperature batteries employing Li alloy anodes, molten salt electrolytes and FeS cathodes were demonstrated to be resilient and operational for several days. For further improvements in performance, i.e., both specific energy and operational life, new high-capacity cathode materials are needed. Transition metal phosphorus trisulfides (TMPS3) are promising with considerably higher (2X) specific capacity, specific energy and energy density, by virtue of their ability to react with more than two lithium ions. This papers describes the assessment of these cathodes for high temperature batteries to power future Venus landers and probes. Manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel phosphorus trisulfides were synthesized and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and tested in our high-temperature laboratory cells at 475 degrees C using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic discharges at different rates. Mn, Fe and Ni phosphorus trisulfides showed reversible behavior in cyclic voltammetric measurements. In the discharge tests, NiPS(3)displayed the highest capacity out of the three metal phosphorous trisulfides tested at both C/20 and C/720 rates, with higher voltages and slightly higher capacity than FeS, followed by FePS3, while MnPS(3)displayed relatively poor performance at C/20. Cathodes extracted from the discharged cells contain the transition metal (Fe, Ni or Mn) and Li2S by XRD, as expected from the reaction scheme.

Based on satellite observations, here we show that diverse land use changes in southern China have increased standing aboveground carbon stocks by 0.110.05Pg C y(-1) during 2002-2017. Most of this regional carbon sink was contributed by newly established forests (32%), while forests already existing contributed 24%. Forest growth in harvested forest areas contributed 16% and non-forest areas contributed 28% to the carbon sink, while timber harvest was tripled. Soil moisture declined significantly in 8% of the area. We demonstrate that land management in southern China has been removing an amount of carbon equivalent to 33% of regional fossil CO2 emissions during the last 6 years, but forest growth saturation, land competition for food production and soil-water depletion challenge the longevity of this carbon sink service.

However, observed TOA fluxes are hard to estimate as they exhibit considerable variability in space and time that depend on the distributions of clouds, ozone (O-3), water vapor (H2O), air temperature (T-a), and surface temperature (T-s). Benchmarking present-day fluxes and quantifying the relative influence of their drivers is the first step for estimating climate feedbacks from ozone radiative forcing and predicting radiative forcing evolution. To that end, we constructed observational instantaneous radiative kernels (IRKs) under clear-sky conditions, representing the sensitivities of the TOA flux in the 9.6 mu m ozone band to the vertical distribution of geophysical variables, including O-3, H2O, T-a, and T-s based upon the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) measurements. Applying these kernels to present-day simulations from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) project as compared to a 2006 reanalysis assimilating satellite observations, we show that the models have large differences in TOA flux, attributable to different geophysical variables. In particular, model simulations continue to diverge from observations in the tropics, as reported in previous studies of the Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) simulations. The principal culprits are tropical middle and upper tropospheric ozone followed by tropical lower tropospheric H2O. Five models out of the eight studied here have TOA flux biases exceeding 100 mW m(-2) attributable to tropospheric ozone bias. Another set of five models have flux biases over 50 mW m(-2) due to H2O. On the other hand, Ta radiative bias is negligible in all models (no more than 30 mW m(-2)). We found that the atmospheric component (AM3) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) general circulation model and Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) have the lowest TOA flux biases globally but are a result of cancellation of opposite biases due to different processes. Overall, the multi-model ensemble mean bias is -133 +/- 98 mW m(-2), indicating that they are too atmospherically opaque due to trapping too much radiation in the atmosphere by overestimated tropical tropospheric O-3 and H2O. Having too much O-3 and H2O in the troposphere would have different impacts on the sensitivity of TOA flux to O-3 and these competing effects add more uncertainties on the ozone radiative forcing. We find that the inter-model TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) difference is well anti-correlated with their ozone band flux bias. This suggests that there is significant radiative compensation in the calculation of model outgoing longwave radiation.

These events are part of a long-lived cluster of historical earthquakes along the Eastern California Shear Zone (ECSZ) which started in 1872 and are associated with temporarily elevated strain rates. We find that the M-w 6.5 event initiated on a right-lateral NW striking fault and then ruptured a left-lateral fault to the surface. This event triggered right-lateral slip during the M-w 7.1 earthquake. It started as a bilateral, crack-like rupture on a segment brought closer to failure by the M-w 6.5 event. The rupture evolved to pulse-like as it propagated at a relatively slow velocity (2 km/s) along a segment that was unloaded by the M-w 6.5 event. It stopped abruptly at the Coso volcanic area and at the Garlock Fault and brought some neighbouring faults closer to failure.

A repeating fast radio burst source localized to a nearby spiral galaxy	NATURE			English	Article							STAR-FORMATION; PULSAR; DENSITY; MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; EMISSION; REDSHIFT; REGIONS; VLA	Only one repeating fast radio burst has been localized, to an irregular dwarf galaxy; now another is found to come from a star-forming region of a nearby spiral galaxy. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, bright, extragalactic radio flashes(1,2). Their physical origin remains unknown, but dozens of possible models have been postulated(3). Some FRB sources exhibit repeat bursts(4-7). Although over a hundred FRB sources have been discovered(8), only four have been localized and associated with a host galaxy(9-12), and just one of these four is known to emit repeating FRBs(9). The properties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, could provide important clues about their physical origins. The first known repeating FRB, however, was localized to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy, and the apparently non-repeating sources were localized to higher-metallicity, massive elliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and apparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins. Here we report the precise localization of a second repeating FRB source(6), FRB 180916.J0158+65, to a star-forming region in a nearby (redshift 0.0337 +/- 0.0002) massive spiral galaxy, whose properties and proximity distinguish it from all known hosts. The lack of both a comparably luminous persistent radio counterpart and a high Faraday rotation measure(6) further distinguish the local environment of FRB 180916.J0158+65 from that of the single previously localized repeating FRB source, FRB 121102. This suggests that repeating FRBs may have a wide range of luminosities, and originate from diverse host galaxies and local environments.

Chemical and physical measurements obtained by the Dawn mission enabled the quantification of key parameters, which helped to constrain the habitability of the inner solar system's only dwarf planet. The surface chemistry and internal structure of Ceres testify to a protracted history of reactions between liquid water, rock, and likely organic compounds. We review the clues on chemical composition, temperature, and prospects for long-term occurrence of liquid and chemical gradients. Comparisons with giant planet satellites indicate similarities both from a chemical evolution standpoint and in the physical mechanisms driving Ceres' internal evolution.

J	Jung, J; Yun, SH				Jung, Jungkyo; Yun, Sang-Ho			Evaluation of Coherent and Incoherent Landslide Detection Methods Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar for Rapid Response: A Case Study for the 2018 Hokkaido Landslides	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						landslide detection; coherent change detection; incoherent change detection; synthetic aperture radar; natural disaster	TEMPORAL DECORRELATION MODEL; MULTITEMPORAL SAR; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; DAMAGE; EARTHQUAKE; INTENSITY; AREAS; IRAN; BAM	Damage mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has been studied in recent decades to support rapid response to natural disasters. Many researches have been developing coherent and incoherent change detection. However, their performances can vary depending on the types of the damages, the characteristics of the scatterers and the corresponding capability of algorithms. In particular, the coherence-based methods have been used as promising detectors over urban areas where high coherences are observed, but their detection accuracies still remain controversial over the area where low coherences are mainly observed such as the 2018 Hokkaido landslides. In order to understand the characteristics of landslide (damage) detectors for low-coherence areas and find an alternative and complementary method, we designed the coherence difference, coherence normalized difference, log-ratio, intensity correlation difference, and normalized differences of the intensity correlation assuming limited availability of dataset, and also developed multi-temporal algorithms using the coherence, intensity, and intensity correlation. They were tested and evaluated using multiple polygons extracted from aerial photos. We were able to observe that the multi-temporal intensity correlation method has the potential to detect the landslides over the low coherence region and all types of land uses.

In this work, a 4-mm-long ICL frequency comb emitting at 3.3 mu m was operated by single-cavity optical self-injection. The experiments employing a free-space optical self-injection length of 1.1m with fine-delay control demonstrated a tuning range of 119MHz around the free-running intermode beat frequency of 9.58 GHz. For resonant fine-delay the line width of the intermode beat frequency was reduced to 390 kHz, what is an improvement by a factor of 40 in comparison to the solitary laser line width.

A Quantitative Framework to Inform Cloud Data System Architecture and Services Requirements Based on User Needs and Expected Demand	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Earth; geographic information systems; geospatial analysis; lakes; market research; oceans; requirements engineering; rivers; sea surface; technical requirements; system of systems		The NASA open data policy and the increases in data volume from recent and future missions have resulted in a need to re-evaluate data archive information systems and services. For example, the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission (SWOT) will produce similar to 15 TB of data every day that needs to be freely and openly accessible through the NASA Physical Oceanography Distribute Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). Because of the computational, and distribution challenges associated with making such volumes of Earth Observation data publicly available, the NASA Earth Science Data Information System (ESDIS) is moving their archive systems, like PO.DAAC, to the cloud. To facilitate this migration, system requirements need to accommodate expected use. As such, the objective of this study was to assesses expected user needs and develop a quantitative framework that can be traced to requirements for the cloud-based data archive system architecture and services that enable data discovery, access and utility. We used a two-tier data gathering method that included a short survey of potential users (identified at professional meetings and community listservs) and in-depth interviews. The survey provided a means for scaling findings from the in-depth interviews to a more representative sample, thus enabling assessment of expected impact to various user communities for different services that could be provided. This framework enables traceability for setting priorities for data services development to requirements for a cloud-based data archive system and services that enable data discovery, access and utility.

Status and future developments of integrated photonic spectrographs for astronomy and Earth & planetary sciences	PHOTONIC INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERING VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photonic Instrumentation Engineering VII	FEB 04-06, 2020	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Integrated photonic spectrographs; arrayed waveguide gratings; astronomy; astronomical instruments; miniturization	WAVE-GUIDE GRATINGS	The size and cost of astronomical instruments for extremely large telescopes (ELTs), are pushing the limits of what is feasible, requiring optical components at the very edge of achievable size and performance. Operating at the diffraction-limit, the realm of photonic technologies, allows for highly compact instruments to be realized. In particular, Integrated Photonic Spectrographs (IPSs) have the potential to replace an instrument the size of a car with one that can be held in the palm of a hand. This miniaturization in turn offers dramatic improvements in mechanical and thermal stability. Owing to the single-mode fiber feed, the performance of the spectrograph is decoupled from the telescope and the instruments point spread function can be calibrated with a much higher precision. These effects combined mean that an IPS can provide superior performance with respect to a classical bulk optic spectrograph. In this paper we provide a summary of efforts made to qualify IPSs for astronomical applications to date. These include the early characterization of arrayed waveguide gratings for multi-object injection and modifications to facilitate a continuous spectrum, to the integration of these devices into prototypical instruments and most recently the demonstration of a highly optimized instrument directly fed from an 8-m telescope. We will then outline development paths necessary for astronomy, currently underway, which include broadening operating bands, bandwidth, increasing resolution, implementing cross-disperison on-chip and integrating these devices with other photonic technologies and detectors such as superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. Although the focus of this work is on IPS applicability to astronomy, they may be even more ideally suited to Earth & planetary science applications.

Kent; Ward-Duong, Kimberly; Wiktorowicz, Sloane; Wolff, Schuyler			An Updated Visual Orbit of the Directly Imaged Exoplanet 51 Eridani b and Prospects for a Dynamical Mass Measurement with Gaia	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							BROWN DWARFS; YOUNG; CATALOG; MODELS	We present a revision to the visual orbit of the young, directly imaged exoplanet 51 Eridani b using four years of observations with the Gemini Planet Imager. The relative astrometry is consistent with an eccentric (e = 0.53(-0.13)(+0.09)) orbit at an intermediate inclination (i = 136(-11)(+10)degrees), although circular orbits cannot be excluded due to the complex shape of the multidimensional posterior distribution. We find a semimajor axis of 11.1(-1.3)(+4.2) au and a period of 28.1(-4.9)(+17.2) yr, assuming a mass of 1.75 M-circle dot for the host star. We find consistent values with a recent analysis of VLT/SPHERE data covering a similar baseline. We investigate the potential of using the absolute astrometry of the host star to obtain a dynamical mass constraint for the planet. The astrometric acceleration of 51.Eri derived from a comparison of the Hipparcos and Gaia catalogs was found to be inconsistent at the 2 sigma-3 sigma level with the predicted reflex motion induced by the orbiting planet. Potential sources of this inconsistency include a combination of random and systematic errors between the two astrometric catalogs and the signature of an additional companion within the system interior to current detection limits. We also explored the potential of using Gaia astrometry alone for a dynamical mass measurement of the planet by simulating Gaia measurements of the motion of the photocenter of the system over the course of the extended 8 yr mission. We find that such a measurement is only possible (>98% probability) given the most optimistic predictions for the Gaia scan astrometric uncertainties for bright stars and a high mass for the planet (greater than or similar to 3.6 M-Jup).

The circumsecondary disk is circumbinary in nature. Interestingly, both disks are interacting, and they possibly rotate in opposite directions. To investigate the nature of this unique twin disk system, we present 0.'' 1 resolution near-infrared polarized intensity images of the circumstellar structures around SR 24, obtained with HiCIAO mounted on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope. Both the circumprimary disk and the circumsecondary disk are resolved and have elongated features. While the position angle of the major axis and radius of the near-IR (NIR) polarization disk around SR 24S are 55 degrees and 137 au, respectively, those around SR 24N are 110 degrees and 34 au, respectively. With regard to overall morphology, the circumprimary disk around SR 24S shows strong asymmetry, whereas the circumsecondary disk around SR 24N shows relatively strong symmetry. Our NIR observations confirm the previous claim that the circumprimary and circumsecondary disks are misaligned from each other. Both the circumprimary and circumsecondary disks show similar structures in (CO)-C-12 observations in terms of its size and elongation direction. This consistency is because both NIR and (CO)-C-12 are tracing surface layers of the flared disks. As the radius of the polarization disk around SR 24N is roughly consistent with the size of the outer Roche lobe, it is natural to interpret the polarization disk around SR 24N as a circumbinary disk surrounding the SR 24Nb-Nc system.

C. C.			K2-19b and c are in a 3:2 Commensurability but out of Resonance: A Challenge to Planet Assembly by Convergent Migration	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							GIANT PLANETS; ORIGIN; ACCRETION; SYSTEM; DISK	K2-19b and c were among the first planets discovered by NASA's K2 mission and together stand in stark contrast with the physical and orbital properties of the solar system planets. The planets are between the size of Uranus and Saturn at 7.0 +/- 0.2 R-circle plus and 4.1 +/- 0.2 R-circle plus, respectively, and reside a mere 0.1% outside the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. They represent a different outcome of the planet formation process than the solar system, as well as the vast majority of known exoplanets. We measured the physical and orbital properties of these planets using photometry from K2, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes, along with radial velocities from Keck/HIRES. Through a joint photodynamical model, we found that the planets have moderate eccentricities of e approximate to 0.20 and well-aligned apsides Delta pi approximate to 0 degrees. The planets occupy a strictly non-resonant configuration: the resonant angles circulate rather than librate. This defies the predictions of standard formation pathways that invoke convergent or divergent migration, both of which predict Delta pi approximate to 180 degrees and eccentricities of a few percent or less. We measured masses of M-p,M-b = 32.4 +/- 1.7 M-circle plus and M-p,M-c = 10.8 +/- 0.6 M-circle plus. Our measurements, with 5% fractional uncertainties, are among the most precise of any sub-Jovian exoplanet. Mass and size reflect a planet's core/envelope structure. Despite having a relatively massive core of M-core approximate to 15 M-circle plus, K2-19b is envelope-rich, with an envelope mass fraction of roughly 50%. This planet poses a challenge to standard models core-nucleated accretion, which predict that cores greater than or similar to 10 M-circle plus will quickly accrete gas and trigger runaway accretion when the envelope mass exceeds that of the core.

Absorption of 5G Radiation in Brain Tissue as a Function of Frequency, Power and Time	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						4G; 5G; microwaves; millimeter-waves; wireless; RF absorption; RF safety; RF heating; bovine brain tissue; Triton gel	TEMPERATURE ELEVATION; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; HUMAN HEAD; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY; ENERGY-ABSORPTION; DIPOLE ANTENNAS; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; RHESUS-MONKEYS; 2450 MHZ	The rapid release of 5G wireless communications networks has spurred renewed concerns regarding the interactions of higher radiofrequency (RF) radiation with living species. We examine RF exposure and absorption in ex vivo bovine brain tissue and a brain simulating gel at three frequencies: 1.9 GHz, 4 GHz and 39 GHz that are relevant to current (4G), and upcoming (5G) spectra. We introduce a highly sensitive thermal method for the assessment of radiation exposure, and derive experimentally, accurate relations between the temperature rise (Delta T), specific absorption rate (SAR) and the incident power density (F), and tabulate the coefficients, Delta T/Delta F and Delta(SAR)/Delta F, as a function of frequency, depth and time. This new method provides both Delta T and SAR applicable to the frequency range below and above 6 GHz as shown at 1.9, 4 and 39 GHz, and demonstrates the most sensitive experimental assessment of brain tissue exposure to millimeter-wave radiation to date, with a detection limit of 1 mW. We examine the beam penetration, absorption and thermal diffusion at representative 4G and 5G frequencies and show that the RF heating increases rapidly with frequency due to decreasing RF source wavelength and increasing power density with the same incident power and exposure time. We also show the temperature effects of continuous wave, rapid pulse sequences and single pulses with varying pulse duration, and we employ electromagnetic modeling to map the field distributions in the tissue. Finally, using this new methodology, we measure the thermal diffusivity of ex vivo bovine brain tissue experimentally.

Current methodologies mainly rely on the use of active and passive microwave sensors, while very few efforts have been devoted to the assessment of the potential of observations based on signals of opportunity. This article aims at assessing the performance of spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for high-spatial and high-temporal resolution monitoring of the Earth-surface freeze/thaw state. To this aim, reflectivity values derived from the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data have been collected and elaborated, and thus compared against the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) freeze/thaw information. Shallow subsurface soil temperature values recorded by a network of in situ stations have been considered as well. Even if an extensive and timeliness cross availability of both types of experimental data is limited by the spatial coverage and density of TDS-1 observations, the proposed analysis clearly indicates a significant seasonal cycle in the calibrated reflectivity. This opens new perspectives for the bistatic L-band high-resolution satellite monitoring of the freeze/thaw state, as well as to support the development of next-generation of GNSS-R satellite missions designed to provide enhanced performance and improved temporal and spatial coverage over high latitude areas.

The sensed data such as weather information or surveillance footage is usually very time sensitive, and the mission will be successful only if the data could be captured and delivered to processing centers on time. Using the data ferrying mechanism, UAVs could collect sensed data from remote areas and ferry the data to appropriate locations for offloading before the on-board storage spaces are overloaded. The data collection and offloading strategies of UAVs should be carefully determined to ensure the timely delivery of information while saving the travel costs. This paper investigates a UAV path planning problem considering realistic data ferrying situations involving data offloading time windows and communication constraints for periodic remote sensing applications. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is formulated that finds paths for UAVs with the minimal cost to meet application deadline requirements under time window and communication constraints on data collection and offloading. A genetic algorithm (GA) based approach is designed to solve this problem. Evaluation results on different input parameters show that the proposed approach could produce near-optimal solutions with much faster execution time than the brute-force approach. The scalability of the proposed approach is validated by a major test case with 120 waypoints, in which stabilized near-optimal solutions could be found within 60,000 iterations.

In this study, two methods that are complementary in terms of identifying temporal changes within an oil slick are presented. The two methods reflect two ways of evaluating the oil slicks. The first method identifies regions within the slick that show persistently high damping ratio (the contrast between clean sea and oil intensity), using higher damping values as a proxy for increasing oil thickness. This method also weights the age of the scenes as the algorithm incorporates new images. The second method outputs the short-term drift pattern and the changes in the damping ratios and copolarization ratios between two scenes, proxies for thickness, and emulsification. Both methods can aid in identifying regions of high priority for oil recovery. Due to the simplicity of the methods, they can be adapted to time-series data from different types of sensors, e.g., optical and SAR imagery. The methods are demonstrated on three L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR UAVSAR time series acquired in November 2016 over a persistent seep in the Mississippi Canyon Block 20 of the Gulf of Mexico. The results of the two methods clearly show the movement and the weathering of the oil as a function of both time and location.

This work presents a high-fidelity simulation, using the Jet Propulsions Laboratory's (JPL) Mission Analysis, Operations and Navigation Toolkit (MONTE), testing the performance of CSAC-driven one-way navigation for a CubeSat. A lunar mission was selected, modelled after the planned lunar-orbiting CubeSats to be released during the Artemis-1 flight. Error sources typical for lunar orbiters, as well as tracking schedules and measurement quality expected for a lunar CubeSat are incorporated into the simulation. CSAC errors, with a thermal variation due to lunar eclipse times, are added to the measurements and the CSAC clock states are estimated alongside the spacecraft ephemeris and other error states. The results show that using CSAC-driven one-way navigation, position resolution of hundreds of meters and velocity resolution of tens of cm/s are achievable. This performance is conditioned on the complexity of a lunar mission, due to the highly elliptical orbit and significant temperature changes during orbit.

Using Conceptual Models to Relate Multiparameter Satellite Data to Subsurface Volcanic Processes in Latin America	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						thermal infrared (TIR); volcano monitoring; InSAR; sulfur dioxide (SO2); satellite remote sensing; Latin America	SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO; CENTRAL ANDES; KILAUEA VOLCANO; SABANCAYA VOLCANO; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; GEOCHEMICAL DATA; TIME-SERIES; ERUPTION; UNREST; INSAR	Satellite data have been extensively used to identify volcanic behavior. However, the physical subsurface processes causing any individual manifestation of activity can be ambiguous. We propose a classification scheme for the cause of unrest that simultaneously considers three multiparameter satellite observations. The scheme is based on characteristics of the volcanic system (open, closed, and eruptive) and unrest mechanisms (intrusion, evolution, and withdrawal) occurring at shallow depths in the volcanic system. We applied these models to satellite observations acquired at 47 of the most active volcanoes in Latin America. Of the volcanoes studied, 44 had a robust enough dataset for classification and were clustered into 4 groups and 10 subgroups with common behavioral characteristics. By identifying that these volcanoes can be clustered into a number of groupings significantly less than the number of volcanoes, we have demonstrated that commonalities in behavior patterns exist among diverse volcanic systems. Identifying volcanoes with similar characteristics underpins the use of past observations at one volcano to forecast activity at another and diverges from typical volcanic groupings, which are focused on geologic parameters (i.e., composition, volcano type, and tectonic setting). Based on satellite data alone, we have identified preeruptive intrusion prior to 15 eruptions at 12 different volcanoes, magma evolution prior to 18 eruptions at 13 volcanoes, and magma withdrawal at 3 eruptions and 3 volcanoes. Improvements to the spatial and temporal resolution are needed to make these relations robust. This classification scheme provides a framework for future automated clustering of volcanoes.

Compared to its predecessor, Jason-3, the two AMR-C radiometer instruments have an external calibration system which enables higher radiometric stability accomplished by moving the secondary mirror between well-defined targets. Sentinel-6 allows continuing the study of the ocean circulation, climate change, and sea-level rise for at least another decade. Besides the external calibration for the AMR heritage radiometer (18.7, 23.8, and 34 GHz channels), the AMR-C contains a high-resolution microwave radiometer (HRMR) with radiometer channels at 90, 130, and 168 GHz.

Rubidium transitions as wavelength reference for astronomical Doppler spectrographs	ADVANCES IN OPTICAL ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTATION 2019	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Optical Astronomical Instrumentation	DEC 09-12, 2019	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	SPIE, Australian Opt Soc		rubidium; hyperfine transition; saturated absorption spectroscopy; Fabry-Perot etalon; wavelength calibration; doppler spectroscopy		Precise wavelength calibration is a critical issue for high-resolution spectroscopic observations. The ideal calibration source should be able to provide a very stable and dense grid of evenly distributed spectral lines of constant intensity. A new method which satisfies all mentioned conditions has been developed by our group. The approach is to actively measure the exact position of a single spectral line of a Fabry-Perot etalon with very high precision with a wavelength-tuneable laser and compare it to an extremely stable wavelength standard. The ideal choice of standard is the D2 absorption line of Rubidium, which has been used as an optical frequency standard for decades. With this technique, the problem of stable wavelength calibration of spectrographs becomes a problem of how reliably we can measure and anchor one etalon line to the Rb transition. In this work we present our self-built module for Rb saturated absorption spectroscopy and discuss its stability.

Revisiting the cosmic-ray induced Venusian radiation dose in the context of habitability	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Sun: activity; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual: radiation dose; planets and satellites: individual: habitability	MAGNETIC-FIELD; SOLAR; LIFE; ACCELERATION; ATMOSPHERE; SURVIVAL; NUCLEI; ENERGY; WATER	Context. Cosmic rays (CRs), which constantly bombard planetary magnetic fields and atmospheres, are the primary driver of atmospheric spallation processes. The higher the energy of these particles, the deeper they penetrate the planetary atmosphere, and the more likely interactions become with the ambient atmospheric material and the evolution of secondary particle showers. Aims. As recently discussed in the literature, CRs are the dominant driver of the Venusian atmospheric ionization and the induced radiation dose below 100 km. In this study, we model the atmospherically absorbed dose and the dose equivalent to the effect of cosmic rays in the context of Venusian habitability. Methods. The Atmospheric Radiation Interaction Simulator was used to model the altitude-dependent Venusian absorbed dose and the Venusian dose equivalent. For the first time, we modeled the dose rates for different shape-, size-, and composition-mimicking detectors (phantoms): a CO2-based phantom, a water-based microbial cell, and a phantom mimicking human tissue. Results. Based on our new model approach, we give a reliable estimate of the altitude-dependent Venusian radiation dose in water-based microorganisms here for the first time. These microorganisms are representative of known terrestrial life. We also present a detailed analysis of the influence of the strongest ground-level enhancements measured at the Earth's surface, and of the impact of two historic extreme solar events on the Venusian radiation dose. Our study shows that because a phantom based on Venusian air was used, and because furthermore, the quality factors of different radiation types were not taken into account, previous model efforts have underestimated the radiation hazard for any putative Venusian cloud-based life by up to a factor of five. However, because we furthermore show that even the strongest events would not have had a hazardous effect on putative microorganisms within the potentially habitable zone (51-62 km), these differences may play only a minor role.

A New Framework to Incorporate High-Latitude Input for Mesoscale Electrodynamics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC GRAVITY-WAVES; VECTOR ELECTRIC-FIELD; JOULE HEATING RATES; E-REGION; THERMOSPHERIC WINDS; AURORAL MODEL; SOLAR-WIND; IONOSPHERE; ENERGY; WEATHER	Global circulation models (GCMs) for the ionosphere-thermosphere system traditionally use empirical models to specify upper boundary conditions to represent solar wind and magnetospheric drivers. However, the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere systems are coupled on different spatial and temporal scales. During increased levels of geomagnetic activity, these empirical models can't resolve dynamic electric field variability (<500 km, <15 min) because of their statistical nature and/or low spatial and temporal resolutions. This results in an underestimation of energy input to the ionosphere, causing disagreements between model results and observations. This paper introduces a new framework to incorporate dynamic electric fields into GCMs: High-latitude Input for Mesoscale Electrodynamics (HIME). As a demonstration HIME uses the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) electric field estimates during an experiment on 2 March 2017. The electric potentials were calculated using the PFISR estimates and merged with a global empirical model of electric potential. A set of high-latitude electric potential drivers were used to drive the University of Michigan Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) to understand the effects of driving at different scales. Data versus model comparisons for ion temperature, electron temperature, and electron density are provided along the PFISR beams. The ion convection velocities and neutral winds at the PFISR location are compared with the PFISR and Scanning Doppler Imager data. The effects of different multiscale drivers are investigated. The results showed that energy deposited by HIME-driven simulations was locally larger by approximately an order of magnitude compared to the empirical model-driven results.	[Ozturk, D.

Proton Acceleration by Io's Alfvenic Interaction	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							WAVE CURRENT SYSTEM; ELECTRON ACCELERATION; PLASMA OBSERVATIONS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; JUPITER; GALILEO; PROPAGATION; VOYAGER-1; MODEL; TAIL	The Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment aboard Juno observed accelerated proton populations connected to Io's footprint tail aurora. While accelerated electron populations have been previously linked with Io's auroral footprint tail aurora, we present new evidence for proton acceleration due to Io's Alfvenic interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. Separate populations were accelerated above the Io torus and at high latitudes near Jupiter. The timing suggests the acceleration is due to Alfven waves associated with Io's Main Alfven Wing. The inferred high-latitude proton acceleration region spans 0.9-2.5 Jovian radii in altitude, comparable to the expected location for electron acceleration, and suggests the associated Alfven waves are able to accelerate electrons and protons in similar locations. The proton populations magnetically connected to Io's orbit are recently perturbed, equilibrating with the nominal torus plasma population on a timescale smaller than Io's System III orbital period of similar to 13 h, likely due to wave-particle interactions. The tail populations are split into a wake-like structure with distinct inner and outer regions, where the inner region maps to an equatorial width nearly identical to the diameter of Io. The approximately symmetric surrounding outer regions are each slightly smaller than the central region and may be related to Io's atmospheric extent. The nominal, corotational torus proton population exhibits energization throughout all regions, peaking at the anti-Jovian flank of the inner core region mapping to Io's diameter. These proton observations suggest Alfven waves are capable of accelerating protons in multiple locations and provide further evidence that Io's Alfvenic interaction is bifurcated. Plain Language Summary The interaction between Jupiter's moon Io and Jupiter's rapidly rotating magnetic field produces a persistent aurora in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. The Juno spacecraft's trajectory crossed magnetic field lines connected to this aurora. We found that protons are accelerated in multiple places between Jupiter and Io. The interaction is evidenced in two distinct regions, with the central core region mapping to almost exactly the size of Io in the equatorial plane. We also find the protons that comprise the nominal "background" population are hotter in this central region.	[Szalay, J. R.; Gershman, D.

How Satellite Soil Moisture Data Can Help to Monitor the Impacts of Climate Change: SMAP Case Studies	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Soil moisture; Meteorology; Monitoring; Floods; Agriculture; Alarm systems; Agriculture; drought monitoring; snowmelt flood prediction; soil moisture active passive (SMAP); soil moisture; weather forecast	DROUGHT; ASSIMILATION; SURFACE; WATER	Socially and economically costly extreme weather events have become more prevalent in the last decade. Monitoring and early warning systems could help mitigate the impact of such events by allowing people to better prepare themselves to manage their responses to these events. One significant element of an effective warning system is soil moisture because it is a key determinant of the exchange of water and heat energy between the land and atmosphere, the partitioning of precipitation between infiltration and runoff, and therefore has an influence on weather patterns and streamflow. In addition, soil moisture governs plant water availability - the key to crop yield forecasting. For these reasons, a wide range of organizations use soil moisture information to better predict and monitor climate and weather phenomena such as floods and droughts. By improving soil moisture estimates, it may be possible to improve the monitoring and early warning systems upon which these organizations rely, and hence better mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events. Through case studies, this article discusses several uses of soil moisture data products from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission to help improve soil moisture-related monitoring and early warning systems.

CubeRRT's key technology is its radiometer digital backend (RDB) that is capable of measuring an instantaneous bandwidth of 1 GHz and of filtering the input signal into an estimated total power with and without RFI contributions. CubeRRT's onboard RFI processing capability dramatically reduces the volume of data that must be downlinked to the ground and eliminates the need for ground-based RFI processing. RFI detection is performed by resolving the input bandwidth into 128 frequency subchannels, with the kurtosis of each subchannel and the variations in power across frequency used to detect nonthermal contributions. RFI filtering is performed by removing corrupted frequency subchannels prior to the computation of the total channel power. The 1 GHz bandwidth input signals processed by the RDB are obtained from the payload's antenna (ANT) and radiometer front end (RFE) subsystems that are capable of tuning across RF center frequencies from 6 to 40 GHz. The CubeRRT payload was installed into a 6U spacecraft bus provided by Blue Canyon Technologies that provides spacecraft power, communications, data management, and navigation functions. The design, development, integration and test, and on-orbit operations of CubeRRT are described in this article. The spacecraft was delivered on March 22nd, 2018 for launch to the International Space Station (ISS) on May 21st, 2018. Since its deployment from the ISS on July 13th, 2018, the CubeRRT RDB has completed more than 5000 h of operation successfully, validating its robustness as an RFI processor. Although CubeRRT's RFE subsystem ceased operating on September 8th, 2018, causing the RDB input thereafter to consist only of internally generated noise, CubeRRT's key RDB technology continues to operate without issue and has demonstrated its capabilities as a valuable subsystem for future radiometry missions.

With the development of UV-visible spectrometers at sub-nm spectral resolution and sophisticated retrieval algorithms, estimates of the column amounts of atmospheric pollutants (O-3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, CHOCHO, and aerosols) can be obtained. To date, all the UV-visible satellite missions monitoring air quality have been in low Earth orbit (LEO), allowing one to two observations per day. With UV-visible instruments on GEO platforms, the diurnal variations of these pollutants can now be determined. Details of the GEMS mission are presented, including instrumentation, scientific algorithms, predicted performance, and applications for air quality forecasts through data assimilation. GEMS will be on board the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite 2 (GEO-KOMPSAT-2) satellite series, which also hosts the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager 2 (GOCI-2). These three instruments will provide synergistic science products to better understand air quality, meteorology, the long-range transport of air pollutants, emission source distributions, and chemical processes. Faster sampling rates at higher spatial resolution will increase the probability of finding cloud-free pixels, leading to more observations of aerosols and trace gases than is possible from LEO. GEMS will be joined by NASA's Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and ESA's Sentinel-4 to form a GEO AQ satellite constellation in early 2020s, coordinated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).

To detect fast optical waveforms directly at power levels far below what traditional optical oscilloscope methods can measure, we use a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) sampling acquisition method, recently developed integrated electro-optic devices with >100 GHz electro-optic bandwidth, and single photon detectors with < 5 ps jitter. We show the reconstruction of the time domain signals by collecting histograms of time-binned single photons captured using TCSPC and characterize the spectral components in the frequency domain. The ability to acquire ultra-weak eye diagrams and identify high-frequency spectral components from a relatively small ensemble of single-photon measurements may lead to significant advances in optical waveform capture technology.

On first-year sea ice (FYI), spatiotemporal variations in snow properties can cause the Ku-band main radar scattering horizon to appear above the snow/sea ice interface. This can increase the estimated sea ice freeboard by several centimeters, leading to FYI thickness overestimations. This article examines the expected changes in Ku-band main scattering horizon and its impact on FYI thickness estimates, with variations in snow temperature, salinity, and density derived from ten naturally occurring Arctic FYI Cases encompassing saline/nonsaline, warm/cold, simple/complexly layered snow (4-45 cm) overlying FYI (48-170 cm). Using a semi-empirical modeling approach, snow properties from these Cases are used to derive layer-wise brine volume and dielectric constant estimates, to simulate the Ku-band main scattering horizon and delays in radar propagation speed. Differences between modeled and observed FYI thickness are calculated to assess sources of error. Under both cold and warm conditions, saline snow covers are shown to shift the main scattering horizon above from the snow/sea ice interface, causing thickness retrieval errors. Overestimates in FYI thicknesses of up to 65% are found for warm, saline snow overlaying thin sea ice. Our simulations exhibited a distinct shift in the main scattering horizon when the snow layer densities became greater than 440 kg/m(3), especially under warmer snow conditions. Our simulations suggest a mean Ku-band propagation delay for snow of 39%, which is higher than 25%, suggested in previous studies.

The MIRI coronagraph on the James Webb Space Telescope can search the 1-3 au (1"-2") region around a Cen A which is predicted to be stable within the a Cen AB system. We demonstrate that with reasonable performance of the telescope and instrument, a 20 hr program combining on-target and reference star observations at 15.5 pm could detect thermal emission from planets as small as 5 R. Multiple visits every 3-6 months would increase the geometrical completeness, provide astrometric confirmation of detected sources, and push the radius limit down to 3 R. An exozodiacal cloud only a few times brighter than our own should also be detectable, although a sufficiently bright cloud might obscure any planet present in the system. While current precision radial velocity (PRV) observations set a limit of 50-100 Mjs, at 1-3 au for planets orbiting a Cen A, there is a broad range of exoplanet radii up to 10 Rjs, consistent with these mass limits. A carefully planned observing sequence along with state-of-the-art postprocessing analysis could reject the light from a Cen A at the level of 10-5 at 1"-2" and minimize the influence of a Cen B located 7"-8" away in the 2022-2023 timeframe. These space-based observations would complement on-going imaging experiments at shorter wavelengths as well as PRV and astrometric experiments to detect planets dynamically. Planetary demographics suggest that the likelihood of directly imaging a planet whose mass and orbit are consistent with present PRV limits is small, 5%, and possibly lower if the presence of a binary companion further reduces occurrence rates. However, at a distance of just 1.34 pc, a Cen A is our closest sibling star and certainly merits close scrutiny.

Sentinel-1 InSAR Coherence for Land Cover Mapping: A Comparison of Multiple Feature-Based Classifiers	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Copernicus; interferometric coherence; land cover mapping; Sentinel-1; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE	This article investigates and demonstrates the suitability of the Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover and vegetation mapping. In addition, this study analyzes the performance of this feature along with polarization and intensity products according to different classification strategies and algorithms. Seven different classification workflows were evaluated, covering pixel- and object-based analyses, unsupervised and supervised classification, different machine-learning classifiers, and the various effects of distinct input features in the SAR domain-interferometric coherence, backscattered intensities, and polarization. All classifications followed the Corine land cover nomenclature. Three different study areas in Europe were selected during 2015 and 2016 campaigns to maximize diversity of land cover. Overall accuracies (OA), ranging from 70% to 90%, were achieved depending on the study area and methodology, considering between 9 and 15 classes. The best results were achieved in the rather flat area of Donana wetlands National Park in Spain (OA 90%), but even the challenging alpine terrain around the city of Merano in northern Italy (OA 77%) obtained promising results. The overall potential of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence for land cover mapping was evaluated as very good. In all cases, coherence-based results provided higher accuracies than intensity-based strategies, considering 12 days of temporal sampling of the Sentinel-1 A stack. Both coherence and intensity prove to be complementary observables, increasing the overall accuracies in a combined strategy. The accuracy is expected to increase when Sentinel-1 A/B stacks, i.e., six-day sampling, are considered.

Quasar Accretion Disk Sizes from Continuum Reverberation Mapping in the DES Standard-star Fields	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Quasars; Supermassive black holes; Accretion; Active galactic nuclei; Reverberation mapping	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BROAD-LINE REGION; EMISSION; MASSES; VARIABILITY; STEPS; LAGS	Measurements of the physical properties of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei are important for better understanding the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. We present the accretion disk sizes of 22 quasars from continuum reverberation mapping with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) standard-star fields and the supernova C fields. We construct continuum light curves with the griz photometry that span five seasons of DES observations. These data sample the time variability of the quasars with a cadence as short as 1 day, which corresponds to a rest-frame cadence that is a factor of a few higher than most previous work. We derive time lags between bands with both JAVELIN and the interpolated cross-correlation function method and fit for accretion disk sizes using the JAVELIN thin-disk model. These new measurements include disks around black holes with masses as small as similar to 10(7) M, which have equivalent sizes at 2500 A as small as similar to 0.1 lt-day in the rest frame. We find that most objects have accretion disk sizes consistent with the prediction of the standard thin-disk model when we take disk variability into account. We have also simulated the expected yield of accretion disk measurements under various observational scenarios for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Deep Drilling Fields. We find that the number of disk measurements would increase significantly if the default cadence is changed from 3 days to 2 days or 1 day.	[Yu, Zhefu; Martini, Paul; Kochanek, C. S.; Peterson, B.

This has resulted in different temporal gravity field solutions using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations. In this chapter, we compare timewise batch processor algorithm for solving variational equations with spacewise energy balance approach using simulated GRACE observations. When using error free simulated observations, both approaches perform similarly well. Energy balance approach has the advantage of using less data storage and less computational time. With error contaminated observations, energy balance approach performs worse than variational equations. Because the noise in orbital velocity corrupts the potential difference observables, and respectively the estimate of the gravity field. Although, variational equations perform better, it is important that both positions and range rates are combined and they are properly weighted in solving normal equations.

Contributions of Spore Secondary Metabolites to UV-C Protection and Virulence Vary in Different Aspergillus fumigatus Strains	MBIO			English	Article						Aspergillus fumigatus; space station; UV-C; melanin; secondary metabolite; spore; virulence determinants	IONIZING-RADIATION; MELANIN; GENE; BIOSYNTHESIS; FUNGI; PATHOGENICITY; DEFICIENT; LICHENS; PATHWAY; TERREUS	Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical A. fumigatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of different A. fumigatus isolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-Cprotective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across Aspergillus isolates and by types of environmental stress. IMPORTANCE Fungal spores contain secondary metabolites that can protect them from a multitude of abiotic and biotic stresses. Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse isolates of A. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain of A. fumigatus and identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV-C-protective molecule but not a virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain of A. fumigatus. As protection from elevated levels of radiation is of paramount importance for future human outer space explorations, the discovery of small molecules with radiation-protective potential may result in developing novel safety measures for astronauts.

In previous papers, methods to nowcast earthquakes have been presented based on the natural time count of small earthquakes after the last large earthquake in a defined, seismically active geographic region. In this method, a large geographic region is identified in which a local region of interest is embedded. The primary assumption in the method is that the frequency-magnitude statistics of the local region are the same as the frequency-magnitude relation of the large region. The nowcasting technique relies on seismic catalogs that are complete in the sense that all events whose magnitude is larger than a completeness threshold have been detected. For this reason, the previous papers have been limited to nowcasting large earthquakes with magnitudes of approximately M7.5. In this article, we extend the nowcasting method to great global earthquakes of magnitudes as large as M9 by defining the surrounding large region as the entire earth. We then analyze the current hazard of a number of selected "local" regions and rank the regions in terms of current risk of great earthquakes. These great events also present significant hazards for generating mega-tsunamis as well as local damage due to intense shaking. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to establish the reliability of the nowcasts. One of our main results is that the eastern Aleutian Islands, site of the M8.6 earthquake of 1 April 1946, is currently the region most at current risk of a great earthquake larger than M8.0. We finish by presenting comments on the applicability of our methods for anticipating the occurrence of great destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.

NOV.; ANNOTATION; FACILITY	Two Gram-stain-positive, motile, endospore-forming, aerobic strains, designated V44-8(T) and V47-23a(T), were isolated from environmental air sampling at the vehicle assembly building at Cape Canaveral, Florida, where the Viking spacecraft were assembled. Growth was observed at pH 7-9 (optimum, pH 9) for strain V44-8(T), and pH 5-10 (pH 9) for strain V47-23a(T). Both strains displayed growth in 0-5% NaCl with an optimum at 1% for strain V44-8(T); 0% for strain V47-23a(T). Strains V44-8(T) and V47-23a(T) grew optimally at 32 degrees C, (15-32 degrees C) and 25 degrees C (20-45 degrees C), respectively. The cell wall of both strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. Both strains contained phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:0, iso-C-14:0 and iso-C-15:0. Strain V47.23a(T) shared its highest 16S rRNA sequence similarity with Bacillus cavernae DSM-105484(T) at 96.9%, and V44.8(T) with Bacillus zeae DSM-103964(T) at 96.6%. Based on their phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic position inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, the isolates were identified as being a members of the genus Bacillus that forms a separate clade when compared to close relatives. Average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity values between strains V44-8(T) and DSM-103964(T) were 72.1% and 67.5%; V47-23a(T) and DSM-105484(T) were 62.4% and 69.1%, respectively. Based on the phenotypic, genomic and biochemical data, strains V44-8(T) and V47-23a(T) represent two novel species in the genus Bacillus for which the names Bacillus glennii sp. nov. [type strain, V44-8(T) (=ATCC BAA-2860(T) =DSM 105192(T))], and Bacillus saganii sp. nov. [V47-23a(T) (=ATCC BAA-2861(T)=DSM 105190(T))] are proposed.

Holistic Approach for Studying Planetary Hydrospheres: Gibbs Representation of Ices Thermodynamics, Elasticity, and the Water Phase Diagram to 2,300 MPa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; HIGH-PRESSURE; THERMAL EXPANSIVITY; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; VI; H2O; DIFFRACTION; DEPENDENCE; CONSTANTS; DYNAMICS	Gibbs energy representations for ices II, III, V, and VI are reported. These were constructed using new measurements of volumes at high pressure over a range of low temperatures combined with calculated vibrational energies grounded in statistical physics. The collection of representations are released within the open source SeaFreeze program, together with the Gibbs representation already known for ice Ih and water. This program allows accurate determination of thermodynamics properties (phase boundaries, density, specific heat, bulk modulus, thermal expansivity, chemical potentials) and seismic wave velocities over the entire range of conditions encountered in hydrospheres in our solar system (130-500 K to 2,300 MPa). These comprehensive representations allow exploration of the rich spectrum of thermodynamic behavior in the H2O system. Although these results are broadly applicable in science and engineering, their use is particularly relevant to habitability analysis, interior modeling, and future geophysical sounding of water-rich planetary bodies of our solar system and beyond.

Holistic Approach for Studying Planetary Hydrospheres: Gibbs Representation of Ices Thermodynamics, Elasticity, and the Water Phase Diagram to 2,300 MPa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; HIGH-PRESSURE; THERMAL EXPANSIVITY; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; VI; H2O; DIFFRACTION; DEPENDENCE; CONSTANTS; DYNAMICS	Gibbs energy representations for ices II, III, V, and VI are reported. These were constructed using new measurements of volumes at high pressure over a range of low temperatures combined with calculated vibrational energies grounded in statistical physics. The collection of representations are released within the open source SeaFreeze program, together with the Gibbs representation already known for ice Ih and water. This program allows accurate determination of thermodynamics properties (phase boundaries, density, specific heat, bulk modulus, thermal expansivity, chemical potentials) and seismic wave velocities over the entire range of conditions encountered in hydrospheres in our solar system (130-500 K to 2,300 MPa). These comprehensive representations allow exploration of the rich spectrum of thermodynamic behavior in the H2O system. Although these results are broadly applicable in science and engineering, their use is particularly relevant to habitability analysis, interior modeling, and future geophysical sounding of water-rich planetary bodies of our solar system and beyond.

The temperature field shows weak diurnal tidal activity at equatorial latitudes but a strong diurnal tide in middle to high latitudes with a maximum amplitude of 29 K in the lower atmosphere of the south polar region. The diurnal variability of dust is small in the equatorial region and increases toward higher latitudes. At middle and low latitudes, comparable dust amounts are found about 5-10 km higher in the atmosphere on the dayside than on the nightside. The dust reaches the highest altitudes in the late afternoon and is found at the lowest altitudes in the late night. In the southern high latitudes a persistent cold air mass with low dust content is identified on the nightside of the planet centered at 3-6 a.m. local time. The observed variations are well represented by model simulations with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique General Circulation Model. Comparisons between data and model results suggest that the diurnal variations in the dust are largely driven by the meridional circulation exhibiting diurnal tidal variations. The model results show that the compact air mass in the south polar region has a high potential vorticity, supporting its interpretation as a remnant of the southern polar vortex, which is forced toward the nightside of the planet due to the enhanced diurnal tide during the global dust event. Plain Language Summary One of the most distinctive features of the Martian atmosphere are global dust storms, one of which occurred in 2018. We report on observations of the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature and dust by the Mars Climate Sounder onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Strong differences between day and night are found in both temperature and dust vertical structure. The strongest temperature variations are observed in the south polar atmosphere, with temperature differences up to 58 degrees C/136 degrees F between day and night. Comparable dust amounts are found 5-10 km (3-6 miles) higher in the atmosphere on the dayside than on the nightside at central and equatorial latitudes. In the southern polar region a persistent cold body of air with low dust is identified on the nightside of the planet. The observations are compared with the results from a global atmospheric computer model. The observed temperature and dust distribution and their variations over the Martian day are well represented by the model. The diurnal variations in the dust are largely driven by diurnal changes in the large- scale atmospheric circulation. The compact body of air in the south polar region is forced to the nightside by this altered circulation but does not dissipate for several months.

All four disks are resolved for the first time in polarized light, and one disk is also detected in total intensity. The three disks imaged around HD 111161, HD 143675, and HD 145560 are symmetric in both morphology and brightness distribution. The three systems span a range of inclinations and radial extents. The disk imaged around HD 98363 shows indications of asymmetries in morphology and brightness distribution, with some structural similarities to the HD 106906 planet-disk system. Uniquely, HD 98363 has a wide comoving stellar companion, Wray 15-788, with a recently resolved disk with very different morphological properties. HD 98363 A/B is the first binary debris disk system with two spatially resolved disks. All four targets have been observed with ALMA, and their continuum fluxes range from one nondetection to one of the brightest disks in the region. With the new results, a total of 15 A/F stars in Sco-Cen have resolved scattered-light debris disks, and approximately half of these systems exhibit some form of asymmetry. Combining the GPI disk structure results with information from the literature on millimeter fluxes and imaged planets reveals a diversity of disk properties in this young population. Overall, the four newly resolved disks contribute to the census of disk structures measured around A/F stars at this important stage in the development of planetary systems.

Sensitivity of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to Geothermal Heat	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article							SEA-LEVEL; SHEET; MODEL; FLOW; UNCERTAINTIES	Recent observations of ice flow surface velocities have helped improve our understanding of basal processes on Greenland and Antarctica, though these processes still constitute some of the largest uncertainties driving ice flow change today. The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream is driven largely by basal sliding, believed to be related to subglacial hydrology and the availability of heat. Characterization of the uncertainties associated with Northeast Greenland Ice Stream is crucial for constraining Greenland's potential contribution to sea level rise in the upcoming centuries. Here, we expand upon past work using the Ice Sheet System Model to quantify the uncertainties in models of the ice flow in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream by perturbing the geothermal heat flux. Utilizing a subglacial hydrology model simulating sliding beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet, we investigate the sensitivity of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream ice flow to various estimates of geothermal heat flux, and implications of basal heat flux uncertainties on modeling the hydrological processes beneath Greenland's major ice stream. We find that the uncertainty due to sliding at the bed is 10 times greater than the uncertainty associated with internal ice viscosity. Geothermal heat flux dictates the size of the area of the subglacial drainage system and its efficiency. The uncertainty of ice discharge from the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to the ocean due to uncertainties in the geothermal heat flux is estimated at 2.10 Gt/yr. This highlights the urgency in obtaining better constraints on the highly uncertain subglacial hydrology parameters.	[Smith-Johnsen, S.; de Fleurian, B.; Nisancioglu, K.

However, this observational technique still remains a challenging task that requires improvement of its methodology. This was the purpose of this study, and for this, GPS data from the Australian Continuously Operating Research Station (CORS) network during a severe weather event were used. Sensitivity tests and statistical cross-comparisons of tomography retrievals with independent observations from radiosonde and radio-occultation profiles showed improved results using the presented methodology. The initial conditions, which were associated with different time-convergence of tomography inversion, play a critical role in GPS tomography. The best strategy can reduce the normalised root mean square (RMS) of the tomography solution by more than 3 with respect to radiosonde estimates. Data stacking and pseudo-slant observations can also significantly improve tomography retrievals with respect to non-stacked solutions. A normalised RMS improvement up to 17% in the 0-8 km layer was found by using 30 min data stacking, and RMS values were divided by 5 for all the layers by using pseudo-observations. This result was due to a better geometrical distribution of mid- and low-tropospheric parts (a 30% coverage improvement). Our study of the impact of the uncertainty of GPS observations shows that there is an interest in evaluating tomography retrievals in comparison to independent external measurements and in estimating simultaneously the quality of weather forecasts. Finally, a comparison of multi-model tomography with numerical weather prediction shows the relevant use of tomography retrievals to improving the understanding of such severe weather conditions.

River basin development, such as dams and water infrastructure in transboundary rivers, can be a potential factor of tensions between upstream and downstream countries since dams constructed upstream can adversely affect downstream riparians. However, because most of the information related to North Korea has been limited to the public, the information about dams constructed and their locations were inaccurate in many previous studies. In addition, water resources in transboundary rivers can be exploited as a political tool. Specifically, due to the unexpected water release from the Hwanggang Dam, upstream of the transboundary Imjin River in North and South Korea, six South Koreans died on 6 September 2009. The Imjin River can be used as a political tool by North Korea, and seven events were reported as water conflicts in the Imjin River from 2001 to 2016. In this paper, firstly, we have updated the information about the dams constructed over the Imjin River in North Korea using multi-temporal images with a high spatial resolution (15-30 cm) obtained from Google Earth. Secondly, we analyzed inter- and intra-water variability over the Hwanggang Reservoir using open-source images obtained from the Global Surface Water Explorer. We found a considerable change in water surface variability before and after 2008, which might result from the construction of the Hwanggang Dam. Thirdly, in order to further investigate intra-annual water variability, we present a method monitoring water storage changes of the Hwanggang Reservoir using the area-elevation curve (AEC), which was derived from multi-sensor Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (Sentinel-1A and -1B) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Since many previous studies for estimating water storage change have depended on satellite altimetry dataset and optical images for deriving AEC, the method adopted in this study is the only application for such inaccessible areas since no altimetry ground track exists for the Hwanggang Reservoir and because clouds can block the study area for wet seasons. Moreover, this study has newly proven that unexpected water release can occur in dry seasons because the water storage in the Hwanggang Reservoir can be high enough to conduct a release that can be used as a geopolitical tool. Using our method, potential risks can be mitigated, not in response to a water release, but based on pre-event water storage changes in the Hwanggang Reservoir.

It includes a multispectral thermal infrared radiometer that measures the radiances in five spectral channels between 8 and 12 mu m. The primary goal of the mission is to study how plants use water by measuring their temperature from the vantage point of the International Space Station. However, as ECOSTRESS retrieves the surface temperature, the data can be used to measure other heat-related phenomena, such as heat waves, volcanic eruptions, and fires. We have cross-compared the temperatures obtained by ECOSTRESS, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance radiometer (ASTER) and the Landsat 8 Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) in areas where thermal anomalies are present. The use of ECOSTRESS for temperature analysis as well as ASTER and Landsat 8 offers the possibility of expanding the availability of satellite thermal data with very high spatial and temporal resolutions. The Temperature and Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm was used to retrieve surface temperatures from the ECOSTRESS and ASTER data, while the single-channel algorithm was used to retrieve surface temperatures from the Landsat 8 data. Atmospheric effects in the data were removed using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN) radiative transfer model driven with vertical atmospheric profiles collected by the University of Wyoming. The test sites used in this study are the active Italian volcanoes and the Parco delle Biancane geothermal area (Italy). In order to test and quantify the difference between the temperatures retrieved by the three spaceborne sensors, a set of coincident imagery was acquired and used for cross comparison. Preliminary statistical analyses show a very good agreement in terms of correlation and mean values among sensors over the test areas.

One of the major triggering factors of flash floods is the extreme events like cloudburst that causes flooding of area within a short span of time. Therefore, this study aims to understand the variations in hydro-meteorological variables during the devastating Kedarnath cloudburst in the Uttarakhand, India. The hydro-meteorological variables were collected from the global satellites such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, modelled datasets from Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer and National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). For the validation of satellite meteorological data, the NCEP Global analysis data were downscaled using Weather Research and Forecasting model over the study area to achieve the meteorological variables' information. The meteorological factors such as atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, rainfall, cloud water content, cloud fraction, cloud particle radius, cloud mixing ratio, total cloud cover, wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity were studied during the cloudburst, before as well as after the event. The outcomes of this study indicate that the variability in hydro-meteorological variables over the Kedarnath had played a significant role in triggering the cloudburst in the area. The results showed that during the cloudburst, the relative humidity was at the maximum level, the temperature was very low, the wind speed was slow and the total cloud cover was found at the maximum level. It is expected that because of this situation a high amount of clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and resulted in a cloudburst over the Kedarnath region.

The amount of heat it can store is modulated by its complex circulation, which spans a broad range of spatial scales, from metres to thousands of kilometres. In the classical paradigm, fine oceanic scales, less than 20 km in size, are thought to drive a significant downward heat transport from the surface to the ocean interior, which increases oceanic heat uptake. Here we use a combination of satellite and in situ observations in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to diagnose oceanic vertical heat transport. The results explicitly demonstrate how deep-reaching submesoscale fronts, with a size smaller than 20 km, are generated by mesoscale eddies of size 50-300 km. In contrast to the classical paradigm, these submesoscale fronts are shown to drive an anomalous upward heat transport from the ocean interior back to the surface that is larger than other contributions to vertical heat transport and of comparable magnitude to air-sea fluxes. This effect can remarkably alter the oceanic heat uptake and will be strongest in eddy-rich regions, such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the Kuroshio Extension and the Gulf Stream, all of which are key players in the climate system.

In deserts, areas of very high sensitivity to land-use changes, these local-scale impacts are not well documented. On the arid southwestern coast of Peru, several vast irrigation programmes were developed in the 1950s on the flat detritic plateau surrounding narrow valleys to supply new farming areas. We document the long-term effects of irrigation on the erosion of arid deserts in the Vitor and Siguas valleys, south Peru, using 40 yr of satellite data. We demonstrate that irrigation initiated very large slow-moving landslides, affecting one-third of the valleys. Their kinematics present periods of quiescence and short periods of rapid activity, corresponding to landslide destabilization by their headscarp retrogression. This analysis suggests that the landslide motion continues long after their initiation by irrigations. Those landslides affect the fertile valley floors, leading to the destruction of villages and agricultural areas. We conclude that modern intensive farming can strongly impact traditional agriculture in desert areas where water management is particularly critical.

Simulation of Nonspherical Asteroid Landers: Contact Modeling and Shape Effects on Bouncing	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							SURFACE; DEPLOYMENT; ROVERS	This paper presents a methodology for the fast, parallelized simulation of the bouncing deployment of lander/rover probe to an asteroid or comet. The target asteroid or comet is represented implicitly with a signed distance field, allowing for fast collision detection with high-resolution shape models. The gravity field of the target body is voxelized to make run-time computations efficient. Collisions and contact motion between a probe with arbitrary shape/inertia and the target body are evaluated using a hard-surface contact model with restitution and friction. The shape, gravity, and contact models are well suited for parallel implementation on a high-end graphics processing unit found in modern personal computers, which enables broad but detailed studies with a relatively large amount of simulations. Probe deployment to asteroid Itokawa is simulated to examine the trends in the motion of different probe shapes. Similarly, the effect of variations in the surface interaction coefficients and probe mass distribution are identified. These results are compared and contrasted with previously observed trends in the motion of strictly spherical probes and have implications for the general design of small-body surface exploration probes.

Although much of the operational history of the mission has been captured in the literature, this work is intended to gather and highlight underreported issues and lessons that would be of specific interest to future electric propulsion and/or asteroid missions. This paper describes the most significant engineering resources consumed over the course of the mission and the use of redundant hardware and software. Also detailed are thermal, micrometeoroid, radiation, and other environmental effects and anomalies that the Dawn spacecraft experienced. A brief description of the mission and spacecraft hardware is also provided.

Juno/JIRAM: Planning and commanding activities	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Commanding; Planning; Ground Segment; JIRAM; JUPITER		In the context of space missions, where science is the most important goal, careful planning and detailed commanding are fundamental. The planning and commanding phases are activities whose complexity depends on the instrument characteristics, environmental constraints and scientific goals. The purpose of this work is to describe in detail these activities for the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) on board the Juno spacecraft, a NASA mission to Jupiter. To maximize the scientific return, we fully employ the flexibility offered by the JIRAM operational modes to efficiently plan observations of various Jovian targets, in spite of the harsh Jovian radiation environment and the spinning state of the Juno spacecraft. Moreover, the JIRAM observations are limited by the challenging pointing and timing scheme of the mission, which impose constraints on both the observation planning and instrumental commanding.

The use of hydrogen and oxygen extracted from accumulations of water is viewed as particularly promising. Several lines of evidence point to the presence of water, possibly in the form of water ice, stored within cold trap reservoirs in the permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) of the northern and southern poles of the Moon. The type and spatial resolution of available datasets however prevent evaluation of resource potential on a scale relevant to address geological uncertainties and assess the technological and economic feasibility of water resource extraction for use by an in-space market. Surface field exploration is required to reduce investment risk; however the success of resource exploration activities will depend on the selection of appropriate exploration methods. To address this we introduce the application of play-based exploration (PBE) techniques, a resource exploration approach commonly used by the terrestrial petroleum and geothermal energy industries to direct decision making regarding high-risk ventures. Applied to the Moon this method seeks to identify locations where exploration activities are most likely to encounter an economically/ commercially viable quantity of water guided by the geological concepts of delivery, trapping, and storage of water molecules within a reservoir. In this study we examine the critical geological uncertainties in the reservoir system model and provide recommendations for resource exploration approach, data collection, and analysis techniques.

LaRa Team	The radioscience LaRa instrument onboard ExoMars 2020 to investigate the rotation and interior of mars	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							FREE CORE NUTATION; DOPPLER TRACKING; CHANDLER-WOBBLE; BULK COMPOSITION; NETWORK SCIENCE; GRAVITY-FIELD; EARTH; DYNAMICS; LANDER; CONSTRAINTS	LaRa (Lander Radioscience) is an experiment on the ExoMars 2020 mission that uses the Doppler shift on the radio link due to the motion of the ExoMars platform tied to the surface of Mars with respect to the Earth ground stations (e.g. the deep space network stations of NASA), in order to precisely measure the relative velocity of the lander on Mars with respect to the Earth. The LaRa measurements shall improve the understanding of the structure and processes in the deep interior of Mars by obtaining the rotation and orientation of Mars with a better precision compared to the previous missions. In this paper, we provide the analysis done until now for the best realization of these objectives. We explain the geophysical observation that will be reached with LaRa (Length-of-day variations, precession, nutation, and possibly polar motion). We develop the experiment set up, which includes the ground stations on Earth (so-called ground segment). We describe the instrument, i.e. the transponder and its three antennas. We further detail the link budget and the expected noise level that will be reached. Finally, we detail the expected results, which encompasses the explanation of how we shall determine Mars' orientation parameters, and the way we shall deduce Mare interior structure and Mars' atmosphere from them. Lastly, we explain briefly how we will be able to determine the Surface platform position.

Detecting Endogenous Microbial Metabolism and Differentiating Between Abiotic and Biotic Signals Observed by Bioelectrochemical Systems in Soils	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Microbial metabolism; Electrochemistry; Microbial fuel cell; Life detection	HUMIC SUBSTANCES; ORGANIC-MATTER; MARTIAN SOIL; LIFE; MARS; REDUCTION; BACTERIAL; SEARCH; ENERGY; THERMODYNAMICS	Unambiguous detection of chemical and physical signatures of microbial life on Mars or other solar system bodies requires differentiation between signals produced by biotic and abiotic processes; instruments aimed at generalized in situ extant life detection would therefore increase the science return of a life-detection mission. Here, we investigate Bioelectrochemical Systems (BES) as a technique to measure microbial metabolism (which produces electrical current and redox changes) and distinguish between potential abiotic and biotic responses in environmental samples. Samples from inhabited niches should contain everything necessary to produce current, that is, catalysts (microorganisms) and fuel (nutrients). BES can also probe for inactive organisms in less energetically rich areas by adding a fuel to drive metabolism. A commercial potting soil and a Mars simulant soil were inoculated in the anodic chamber of microbial fuel cells, and current was monitored over time. Addition of a fuel (electron donor) source was tested for metabolic stimulation of endogenous microbes. Redox reactions between Mars simulant soil and the introduced electron donor (lactate) produced false-positive results, emphasizing the importance of careful interpretation of signals obtained. The addition of lactate to both soils resulted in enhanced biologically produced current, allowing stimulation and detection of dormant microbes. Our results demonstrate that BES provide an approach to detect metabolism in samples without prior knowledge of the organisms present, and that thorough electrochemical analyses and experimental design are necessary to determine if signals are biotic.

Experimental Visualization of Hybrid Combustion: Results at Elevated Pressures	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							REGRESSION-RATE	This work was undertaken in an effort to improve the understanding of the combustion processes inside classical and fast-burning hybrid rocket motors. In this paper, a combustion visualization experiment and various optics were used to explore the mass transfer phenomena, boundary-layer growth rates, and the flame location above combusting fuels at atmospheric and elevated chamber pressures. The results presented provide strong confirmation of the basic droplet formation and entrainment mechanism for fast-burning fuels at operating conditions representative of those in a typical hybrid rocket motor. Entrained filament structures were not observed to be the dominant feature at chamber pressures above the critical pressure of the fuel; instead, at high pressures, numerous intense mass ejection events emitting large numbers of droplets were observed to be a major mass transfer mechanism. Imaging diagnostics were successfully used to quantify the location of the flame and the boundary-layer edge for classical and high-regression-rate fuels at a range of operating conditions. The imaging systems are also used in conjunction with chamber pressure data to examine the flameholding instability around the leading edge of the fuel grain.

The low cost of such a radar, together with the availability of small satellite, platforms to carry it, now make it feasible to consider employing a more distributed approach to observe important atmospheric processes that relate to precipitation. An approach to quantify the transport of water and air by deep convection is described based on a clustering of small radar satellites providing measurements seconds apart. This strategy now adds time as a new dimension for observing such processes. A mission concept, referred to as D-train, comprised of a train of three satellites 30, 90, and 120 s apart is described, and the expected performance of it for providing measures of convective transport is examined based on a large ensemble of simulations of convection with an advanced cloud-resolving model.

This positioning system relies on the unscented Kalman filter and several open source pulsar timing software libraries to estimate the observatory position in an Earth-fixed coordinate system. Monte Carlo analysis was used to numerically verify the filter implementation. Pulsar time-of-arrival data obtained from L-band measurements were used for the experimental verification.

The 6-hourly output from the MJO Task Force (MJOTF)/GEWEX Atmospheric System Study (GASS) project is also analyzed. Contrasting statistics produced from individual models that primarily differ in representations of moist convection suggest that convective transition statistics can substantially distinguish differences in convective representation and its interaction with the large-scale flow, while models that differ only in spatial-temporal resolution, microphysics, or ocean-atmosphere coupling result in similar statistics. Most of the models simulate some version of the observed sharp increase in precipitation as CWV exceeds a critical value, as well as that convective onset occurs at higher CWV but at lower column RH as temperature increases. While some models quantitatively capture these observed features and associated probability distributions, considerable intermodel spread and departures from observations in various aspects of the precipitation-CWV relationship are noted. For instance, in many of the models, the transition from the low-CWV, nonprecipitating regime to the moist regime for CWV around and above critical is less abrupt than in observations. Additionally, some models overproduce drizzle at low CWV, and some require CWV higher than observed for strong precipitation. For many of the models, it is particularly challenging to simulate the probability distributions of CWV at high temperature.	[Kuo, Yi-Hung; Neelin, J.

Here, we assess both the seasonality and the vertical distribution of submesoscale motions in an open-ocean region of the northeast Atlantic. Second-order structure functions, or variance in properties separated by distance, are calculated from submesoscale-resolving ocean glider and mooring observations, as well as a 1/48 degrees numerical ocean model. This dataset combines a temporal coverage that extends through a full seasonal cycle, a horizontal resolution that captures spatial scales as small as 1 km, and vertical sampling that provides near-continuous coverage over the upper 1000 m. While kinetic and potential energies undergo a seasonal cycle, being largest during the winter, structure function slopes, influenced by dynamical characteristics, do not exhibit a strong seasonality. Furthermore, structure function slopes show weak vertical variations; there is not a strong change in properties across the base of the mixed layer. Additionally, we compare the observations to output from a high-resolution numerical model. The model does not represent variability associated with superinertial motions and does not capture an observed reduction in submesoscale kinetic energy that occurs throughout the water column in spring. Overall, these results suggest that the transfer of mixed layer submesoscale variability down to depths below the traditionally defined mixed layer is important throughout the weakly stratified subpolar mode waters.

S.; Ermakov, A., I			The Mercury gravity field, orientation, love number, and ephemeris from the MESSENGER radiometric tracking data	ICARUS			English	Article							INTERNAL STRUCTURE; ROTATION PERIOD; SPIN POLE; MARS; TOPOGRAPHY; ANOMALIES; ACCURACY; MISSION; ORIGIN; TIDES	The Mercury gravity field, spin-pole axis, rotation period, Love number, and ephemeris have been determined using the complete four years of MESSENGER tracking data from March 2011 to April 2015. The pole location and obliquity (1.99 +/- 0.12 arcmin) is consistent with previous determinations. Since MESSENGER was in a highly elliptical orbit with periapsis in the far northern hemisphere, the gravity resolution over the surface of Mercury varies greatly from harmonic degree n = 12 at the south pole to n = 154 in a small region near the north pole which was covered with exceptionally low periapsis data near the end of mission. The gravity field MESS160A is determined ton = 160 and shows notable improvement in the correlation with topography. Three different constraint methods are used to generate the gravity field. The nominal method is a Kaula power law of 5 x 10(-5)/n(2) to constraint the coefficients. One alternate constraint uses surface acceleration measurements, which only constrains the unobserved portion of the gravity field. The other constraint method sets the gravity uncertainties using the harmonic spectrum of the gravity derived from topography. The Mercury tidal Love number solution k(2) = 0.53 +/- 0.03 is larger than previous results but within suggested error bounds. In addition, the technique for estimating the Mercury ephemeris is discussed.	[Konopliv, A. S.; Park, R.

Spectrophotometry from Mars Hand Lens Imager goniometer measurements: Kimberley region, Gale crater	ICARUS			English	Article							PHOTOMETRIC PROPERTIES; EXPLORATION; SCATTERING; MICRONS; LIGHT	The light-scattering properties of surface materials on Mars are typically modeled using in situ spectrophotometric imaging sequences taken at multiple times of day to provide sufficient phase coverage. Herein, we report analyses of observations acquired at one time of day but under varying emission angles using the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) on the robotic arm of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover as a goniometer. A multiple-viewpoint data set was acquired on Sol 544 by manipulating the arm to provide MAHLI images from 20 arm positions, all centered at the same location and from a near-constant distance of 1 m from the surface, permitting a phase angle coverage from similar to 8 to 100 degrees. From these images, we constructed a digital terrain model of the scene, and used it in combination with atmospheric scattering models to remove the diffuse components of radiance from surface units. Radiative transfer models using Hapke theory were conducted using the direct radiance components from specific rock and soil units. Despite the relatively limited number of observations, our modeled Hapke parameters were well constrained for terrain types such as soils and certain types of rocks that were common within the scene, but the errors increased for rock types with fewer observations. Results from one -term and two-term Henyey-Greenstein phase functions show the soil units to be more backscattering than rocks, consistent with previous photometric studies of martian landing sites. Overall, we find that the MAHLI goniometer sequences can produce reasonable and consistent photometric results, providing a new and efficient means of acquiring spectrophotometric data by arm cameras on rovers such as MSL.

Terrestrial single-station analog for constraining the martian core and deep interior: Implications for InSight	ICARUS			English	Article							MANTLE BOUNDARY TOPOGRAPHY; SHEAR VELOCITY; SEISMIC DETECTION; SYNTHETIC SEISMOGRAMS; METEORITE IMPACTS; THERMAL STRUCTURE; LOWERMOST MANTLE; EVENT DETECTION; EARTH; MARS	We used a terrestrial single-station seismometer to quantify the uncertainty of InSight (INterior explorations using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) data for determining Martian core size. To mimic Martian seismicity, we formed a catalog using 917 terrestrial earthquakes, from which we randomly selected events. We stacked ScS amplitudes on modeled arrival times and searched for where ScS produced coherent seismic amplitudes. A core detection was defined by a coherent peak with small offset between predicted and user-selected arrival times. Iterating the detection algorithm with varying signal-to-noise (SNR) ranges and quantity of events determined the selection frequency of each model and quantified core depth uncertainty. Increasing the quantity of events reduced core depth uncertainty while increasing the recovery rate, while increasing event SNR had little effect. Including ScS2 multiples increased the recovery rate and reduced core depth uncertainty when we used low quantities of events. The most-frequent core depths varied by back azimuth, suggesting our method is sensitive to the presence of mantle heterogeneities. When we added 1 degrees in source distance errors, core depth uncertainty increased by up to 11 km and recovery rates decreased by < 5%. Altering epicentral distances by 25% added similar to 35 km of uncertainty and reduced recovery rates to < 50% in some cases. From these experiments, we estimate that if InSight can detect five events with high location precision (< 10% epicentral distance errors), that there is at least an 88% chance of core depth recovery using ScS alone with uncertainty in core depth approaching 18 km and decreasing as more events are located. Plain language summary: We used a seismometer on Earth to study how well the NASA mission, InSight (INterior explorations using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) could detect the Martian core. We created a catalog of earthquakes from which weI randomly selected events to mimic the seismic events (marsquakes) InSight is expected to detect. Several models of Earth's interior were tested to see which best predicted the arrival of seismic waves reflecting off the core. We found utilizing more events allowed us to determine the core size better than using a limited number of events. Using an additional seismic phase also helped us recover a more accurate core depth if there were not a lot of events. We were also able to find variations in the mantle by using events within certain location ranges. Since the InSight team may not be able to locate marsquakes as accurately as we locate earthquakes, we changed the location of the earthquakes. When changes in location were small, we were still able to determine the size of the core. Larger changes in location prevented us from finding an accurate core depth. If InSight detects at least five events with high location accuracy, we will be able to determine the Martian core size.

Multispectral surface emissivity from VIRTIS on Venus Express	ICARUS			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; THERMAL STRUCTURE; DEEP ATMOSPHERE; CLOUD STRUCTURE; LADA-TERRA; NIGHTSIDE; VOLCANISM; MAGELLAN; TOPOGRAPHY	The surface composition of Venus is mostly inaccessible to remote observation due to the dense cloud cover. There are five spectral windows that show measurable thermal emission from the surface at night. The VIRTIS spectrometer on Venus Express observed three of these windows over much of the southern hemisphere of Venus. We use these data along with Magellan altimetry to map surface emissivity. The data are initially processed to correct for instrumental straylight from the dayside of Venus and to improve wavelength registration. These corrected data are then inverted to emissivity at 1020, 1100, and 1180 nm wavelength using lookup tables created by an atmospheric radiative transfer model. As in earlier studies we find residual trends of surface emissivity with respect to the Magellan altimetry that is used in the model to determine surface temperature and thickness of the atmosphere. A new observation is that these trends vary significantly from region to region, indicating some lateral variability of atmospheric parameters, most likely near surface atmospheric temperature. The trends are consistent over hundreds to thousands of km, thus it is possible to correct for them heuristically. In two regions studied in this paper there are significant deviations from the background emissivity which are associated with some geologic features. The high noise in 1100 and 1180 nm maps derived from VIRTIS data result in large uncertainties of spectral shape. The VIRTIS instrument was not designed for this task and future observations could provide high signal to noise ratio maps in at least 5 distinct bands diagnostic of major rock types and minerals.

Evaluation of wet and dry recurring slope lineae (RSL) formation mechanisms based on quantitative mapping of RSL in Garni Crater, Valles Marineris, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars, surface; Geological processes; Mars, climate	ORIGIN; FLOWS	Recurring slope lineae (RSL) are narrow (0.5-5 m) low-albedo features that incrementally lengthen down steep slopes during warm seasons, fade in colder seasons, and recur each Mars year. To reduce the effort involved in manually mapping and analyzing each RSL in Garni crater, we developed Mapping and Automated Analysis of RSL (MAARSL) to analyze a set of orthorectified High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images and a digital elevation map. MAARSL along with manual mapping allowed us to detect RSL, compute descriptive statistics, and characterize changes over time. We mapped 2910 RSL in 22 orthoimages, from Mars Year (MY) 31 solar longitude (L-s) 133.0 degrees to MY32 L-s 323.7 degrees. The MAARSL results confirmed that RSL lengthening and fading occur concurrently on slopes with the same orientation and many times within some individual RSL. Slope angles of RSL and a slope slump show that some RSL start, stop, and have mean slope angles that are below the angle of repose. Our analysis shows that RSL are actively lengthening on at least one slope-facing direction in all HiRISE observations of the crater. We also found that NE-, N-, and NW-facing RSL in Garni crater lengthened during times of increasing shortwave insolation, while S- and SW-facing RSL lengthened during increasing and decreasing shortwave insolation. A (non-orthorectified) HiRISE image acquired shortly after the MY34 dust storm and shows RSL on every slope-facing direction, which is anomalous with respect to observations prior to the dust storm. We find that dust removal and deposition could explain the darkening and fading (respectively) of RSL, and could also explain the apparent lack of material being transported. Observations of RSL lengthening and fading occur concurrently on slopes could suggest overprinting of dry granular flows. Dry flows could also explain the significant lengthening activity of every slope-facing direction after a fresh layer of dust was deposited via the MY34 dust storm. Alternatively, briny shallow subsurface flows are consistent with observations of RSL on slopes below the angle of repose and those that exhibit concurrent lengthening and fading. However, the most significant problem with briny RSL flows is accessing a source of briny water and removing excess salt from the regolith.

Long-term tracking of circumpolar cyclones on Jupiter from polar observations with JunoCam	ICARUS			English	Article							GREAT RED SPOT; POTENTIAL-VORTICITY; CASSINI; FLOW; TURBULENCE; MACROTURBULENCE; ATMOSPHERE; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; VELOCITY	We use observations from the JunoCam instrument on the Juno spacecraft to map the polar regions of Jupiter between 2016 and 2018. These polar maps track the long-term evolution of the pentagonal and octagonal structures of circumpolar cyclones (CPCs). The south-polar pentagonal and north-polar octagonal arrangements of the CPCs have remained largely stable over the last 2 years of observation. The morphologies of individual cyclones also remain largely stable for 1-2 years, although some changes are observed, so that the location of each CPC is uniquely identifiable. At both north and south poles, individual cyclones move around the center to a limited extent, and there is a gap of variable width between one pair of south polar CPCs. Measurements at consecutive closest approaches (perijoves, 53 days apart) show small movements of individual cyclones both eastward and westward. However, the south-polar CPCs have a long-term systematic westward drift rate of 1.5 +/- 0.2 degrees per orbit or 0.040 +/- 0.005 m/s, whereas north polar CPCs do not show a consistent drift in longitude. Around the perimeter of the southern pentagon, we detect no rapid jet in short-term animations, and we provide evidence that anticyclonic white ovals may have a range of longitudinal drifts between -44 and +15 degrees per orbit (+1.8 to -0.7 m/s). Measurement of the angular velocities within the cyclones shows increasing angular velocity with decreasing radius, except in the inner bright cloud deck of one class of northern CPCs, which are inferred to have smaller or even negative angular velocities very near the center. Tangential wind velocities within the cyclones range up to 100 m/s (and even > 100 m/s in the southern polar cyclone) and are maximal between radii of similar to 900-1600 km. Overall, we find that the behavior of the polar cyclones constellations compares well to vortex crystal theory, even though the theory does not include anticyclonic vorticity.

By decomposing w with an omega equation of the primitive equation system and by taking into account the measurement design of the SWOT mission, this study seeks to reconstruct the subinertial, balanced w and zeta signals. By adopting the effective surface quasigeostrophic (eSQG) framework and applying to the Kuroshio Extension region of the North Pacific, we find that the target and reconstructed fields have a spatial correlation of similar to 0.7 below the mixed layer for w and 0.7-0.9 throughout the 1000-m upper ocean for zeta in the error-free scenario. By taking the SWOT sampling and measurement errors into account, the spatial correlation is found to decrease to 0.4-0.6 below the mixed layer for w and 0.6-0.7 for zeta, respectively. For both w and zeta reconstruction, the degradation due to the SWOT errors is more significant in the surface layer and for smaller-scale signals. The impact of errors lessens with the increasing depth and lengthening horizontal scales.

Satellite SAR has primarily been used to detect the presence/absence of oil, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents methods for the rapid classification of oil types and estimated thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., "actionable" oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions, a single polarization satellite SAR image can record a signal variance between thick stable emulsions and non-emulsified oil. During a series of field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico with in situ measurements of oil thickness, multiple satellite data were obtained including fully polarimetric C-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2 and multispectral imagery from ASTER and WorldView-2. One campaign included the airborne polarimetric UAVSAR L-band sensor. An oil/emulsion thickness classification product was generated based on RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery using entropy and the damping ratio derivations. Herein, we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from SAR, validated by sea-truth observations, the multispectral imagery, and the UAVSAR data. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels via NOAA. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, a satellite SAR-based product of oil delineation by relative thickness was delivered to a responding vessel 42 min after the RADARSAT-2 data acquisition. This proof-of-concept test using satellite SAR and multispectral imagery to detect emulsions and deliver a derived information product to a vessel in near-real-time points directly to methods for satellite-based assets to be used in the near future for oil spill tactical response operations.

Constraining the vertical distribution of coastal dust aerosol using OCO-2 O-2 A-band measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerosol profiling; OCO-2; O-2 A-band; CALIPSO; Dust	ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; INFORMATION-CONTENT ANALYSIS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; OPTICAL DEPTH; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; SCIAMACHY OBSERVATIONS; PART II; OXYGEN; CO2; SENSITIVITY	Quantifying the vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols is crucial for estimating their impact on the Earth's energy budget and climate, improving forecast of air pollution in cities, and reducing biases in the retrieval of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from space. However, to date, passive remote sensing measurements have provided limited information about aerosol extinction profiles. In this study, we propose the use of a spectral sorting approach to constrain the aerosol vertical structure using spectra of reflected sunlight absorption within the molecular oxygen (O-2) A-band collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using spectra acquired over the western Sahara coast by comparing the aerosol profile retrievals with lidar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Using a radiative transfer model to simulate OCO-2 measurements, we found that high-resolution O-2 A-band measurements have high sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol layer height (ALH). Retrieved estimates of AOD and ALH based on a look up table technique show good agreement with CALIPSO measurements, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.53, respectively. The strength of the proposed spectral sorting technique lies in its ability to identify spectral channels with high sensitivity to AOD and ALH and extract the associated information from the observed radiance in a straightforward manner. The proposed approach has the potential to enable future passive remote sensing missions to map the aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale.

The absence of a Lunar atmosphere has offered the possibility for mission designers to search for extremely low-altitude, quasi-stable lunar orbits. In addition to the reduced amount of propellant required for station-keeping maneuvers, these orbits present great opportunities for unique scientific studies such as high resolution imaging and characterization of the polar ice deposits in deep craters. Prior to the GRAIL mission, mission planning for Lunar orbiters had suffered from inaccuracies, mainly due to the lack of an accurate Lunar gravity model, which resulted in severe deviations with respect to the spacecraft's nominal orbit. We study station-keeping feasibility for spacecraft in near-polar and extremely low-altitude, quasi-frozen orbits around the Moon, that are perturbed by a high-fidelity lunar gravity model and third-body effects from the Earth and Sun. For several candidate orbits, we compare the trade-space between mission duration and Delta V budget, considering impulsive maneuvers applied once every 'N is an element of {2,6,10,14,18}' orbits at periselene or aposelene. Additionally, we investigate the propulsive cost for different orbit insertion dates, the location of impulsive corrections for arresting argument of periselene (omega) drift, and controlling periselene altitude.

Characterization of Single-mode Fiber Coupling at the Large Binocular Telescope	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						instrumentation; adaptive optics; methods; data analysis; observational; Techniques; image processing; radial velocities		Optimizing on-sky single-mode fiber (SMF) injection is an essential part of developing precise Doppler spectrometers and new astrophotonics technologies. We installed and tested a prototype SMF-injection system at the Large Binocular Telescope in 2016 April. The fiber injection unit was built as part of the derisking process for a new instrument named iLocater that will use adaptive optics (AO) to feed a high resolution, near-infrared spectrograph. In this paper we report Y-band SMF coupling measurements for bright, M-type stars. We compare theoretical expectations for delivered Strehl ratio and SMF coupling to experimental results, and evaluate fundamental effects that limit injection efficiency. We find the pupil geometry of the telescope itself limits fiber coupling to a maximum efficiency of 0.78. Further analysis shows the individual impact of AO correction, tip-tilt residuals, and static (noncommon-path) aberrations contribute coupling coefficients of 0.33, 0.8 respectively. Combined, these effects resulted in an average Y-band SMF efficiency of 0.18 for all observations. Finally, we investigate the impact of fiber coupling on radial velocity precision as a function of stellar apparent magnitude.

Biomass Burning Unlikely to Account for Missing Source of Carbonyl Sulfide	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						carbonyl sulfide; biomass burning; emission factor; emission ratio; forest fire; trace gases	ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS INVENTORY; TRACE GASES; FIRE EMISSIONS; DIMETHYL SULFIDE; GLOBAL SOURCES; DISULFIDE CS2; AEROSOLS; OCS; FOREST; CO	Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) provides a proxy for measuring photosynthesis and is the primary background source of stratospheric aerosols. OCS emissions due to biomass burning are a variable and substantial (over 10%) part of the current OCS budget. OCS emission ratios from open burning fires, coupled with 1997-2016 data from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4), yield OCS biomass burning emissions with a global average annual flux of 60 +/- 37 Gg(S) year(-1). A global box model suggests these emissions are more consistent with observations from global atmospheric composition monitoring networks than fluxes derived from previous synthesis papers. Even after considering the uncertainty in emission factor observations for each category of emissions and the interannual variation in total burned dry matter, the total OCS emissions from open burning are insufficient to account for the large imbalance between current estimates of global OCS sources and sinks.

Researchers within the scientific community have developed numerous methods to identify and track of ARs-a necessary step for analyses on gridded data sets, and objective attribution of impacts to ARs. These different methods have been developed to answer specific research questions and hence use different criteria (e.g., geometry, threshold values of key variables, and time dependence). Furthermore, these methods are often employed using different reanalysis data sets, time periods, and regions of interest. The goal of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) is to understand and quantify uncertainties in AR science that arise due to differences in these methods. This paper presents results for key AR-related metrics based on 20+ different AR identification and tracking methods applied to Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data from January 1980 through June 2017. We show that AR frequency, duration, and seasonality exhibit a wide range of results, while the meridional distribution of these metrics along selected coastal (but not interior) transects are quite similar across methods. Furthermore, methods are grouped into criteria-based clusters, within which the range of results is reduced. AR case studies and an evaluation of individual method deviation from an all-method mean highlight advantages/disadvantages of certain approaches. For example, methods with less (more) restrictive criteria identify more (less) ARs and AR-related impacts. Finally, this paper concludes with a discussion and recommendations for those conducting AR-related research to consider.

We analyze images from the Rosetta mission and report the global characterization of such features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's surface. By assuming the height to runout length as an approximation for the friction coefficient of landslide material, we find that on comet 67P, this ratio falls between 0.50 and 0.97. Such unexpected high values reveal a rocky-type mechanical behavior that is much more akin to Earth dry landslides than to icy satellites' mass movements. This behavior indicates that 67P and likely comets in general are characterized by consolidated materials possibly rejecting the idea that they are fluffy aggregates. The variability of the runout length among 67P landslides can be attributed to the different volatile content located in the top few meters of the cometary crust, which can drive the mass movement.

Post-Collapse Gravity Increase at the Summit of Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Kilauea; microgravity; magma plumbing system; magma supply; magma storage; volcano geodesy	ERUPTION; HAWAII; MICROGRAVITY; STORAGE	We conducted gravity surveys of the summit area of Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, in November 2018 and March 2019, with the goal of determining whether there was any mass change at depth following the volcano's May-August 2018 caldera collapse. Surface deformation between the two surveys was minimal, but we measured a gravity increase (maximum 44 mu Gal) centered on the caldera that can be modeled as mass accumulation in a region similar to 1 km beneath the surface. We interpret this mass increase to be mostly magma accumulation in void space that was created during the summit collapse. Caldera uplift was evident by April 2019, indicating that the magma volume had reached a point where pressurization could be sustained. Modeled gravity change suggests a maximum magma storage rate at Kilauea's summit during November 2018 to March 2019 that is much less than the pre-2018 magma supply rate to the volcano. Plain Language Summary Measuring changes in gravity over time at a volcano provides an indication of mass variation beneath the surface, which can offer evidence of whether or not magma is accumulating in, or draining from, subsurface reservoirs. After the 2018 collapse of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai.i, there was uncertainty over the status of subsurface magmatic activity. We found that an increase in gravity occurred between November 2018 and March 2019. The gravity increase was not accompanied by uplift of the surface, which implies that mass, probably magma, was accumulating in void space created during the collapse. The rate of magma accumulation was much less than the pre-2018-collapse magma supply rate. By April 2019 Kilauea was inflating, indicating that the magma reservoir beneath the summit had filled to the point that pressure could be sustained.

We merge these approaches with an ensemble-based, regional modeling system able to diagnose and quantify the causes of uncertainties in top-down atmospheric estimates of the terrestrial sink over North America. Our ensemble approach quantifies and partitions the uncertainty stemming from atmospheric transport, the biosphere, and large-scale CO2 boundary inflow (boundary conditions). We use meteorological data, CO2 fluxes, and CO2 mole fraction measurements to assure the reliability of the ensemble system. Our results show that all uncertainty components have clear seasonal variations. The biogenic flux component dominates modeled boundary layer CO2 uncertainty, ranging from 2.5 ppm in summer and winter to 1.5 ppm in fall and spring. Spatially, it remains highly uncertain in the U.S. Corn Belt regions. Transport uncertainty reaches a maximum of 2.5 ppm in the summer months and stays at 1.2 ppm for the rest of the year and is highly correlated with the biogenic CO2 fluxes. Boundary conditions play the smallest role in atmospheric boundary layer CO2 uncertainty with a magnitude smaller than 1 ppm. However, boundary conditions are the most important uncertainty component in column-averaged CO2 (XCO2). The spatiotemporal variations of the uncertainties in modeled XCO2 are similar to those in atmospheric boundary layer CO2.

Coevolution of Mars's atmosphere and massive south polar CO2 ice deposit	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							INTERNAL STRUCTURE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; WATER; CAP; EVOLUTION; CYCLE; STRATIGRAPHY; INSTABILITY; STABILITY; VOLATILES	A massive CO2 ice deposit overlies(1) part of Mars's primarily H2O ice(2-4) south polar cap(5). This deposit rivals the mass of Mars's current, 96% CO2, atmosphere(6). Its release could substantially alter Mars's pressure and climate(1). The deposit consists of alternating CO2 and H2O ice layers to a depth of up to approximately 1 km (refs. (1,7,8)). The top layer is an enigmatic(9-11) 1-10 m covering of perennial surface CO2 ice(12) called the residual south polar cap. Typical explanations of the layering invoke orbital cycles(1,7). Up to now, models assumed that the H2O ice layers insulate and seal in the CO2, allowing it to survive high-obliquity periods(7,13). However, these models do not quantitatively predict the deposit's stratigraphy or explain the residual south polar cap's existence. Here we present a model in which the deposit's near-surface CO2 can instead exchange with the atmosphere through permeable H2O ice layers. Using currently observed albedo(14,15) and emissivity(16) properties of the Martian polar CO2 ice deposits, our model predicts that the present massive CO2 ice deposit is a remnant of larger CO2 ice deposits laid down during periods of decreasing obliquity that are ablated, liberating a residual lag layer of H2O ice, when obliquity increases. Fractions of previous CO2 deposits remain as layers because the amplitudes of the obliquity maxima have been mostly decreasing during the past similar to 510 kyr (ref. (17)). Our model simultaneously explains the observed massive CO2 ice deposit stratigraphy, the residual south polar cap's existence and the presence of a massive CO2 ice deposit only in the south. We use our model to calculate Mars's pressure history and determine that the massive CO2 ice deposit is 510 kyr old.	[Buhler, P. B.; Ingersoll, A. P.; Ehlmann, B.

A Damping Effect of the Maritime Continent for the Madden-Julian Oscillation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						the madden-julian oscillation; the maritime continent; convection moisture preconditioning; diurnal cycle	DIURNAL CYCLE; INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION; EASTWARD PROPAGATION; SCALE INTERACTIONS; PREDICTION SKILL; MOISTURE MODES; MJO; PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION; RAINFALL	The damping effect of the Maritime Continent (MC) on propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has been widely recognized; however, its underlying physics remains largely elusive. Capitalizing on the latest high-resolution reanalysis data (ERA-5) from the ECMWF, analyses in this study suggest that the interruption of lower-tropospheric moistening over the MC land during MJO eastward propagation is mainly due to a drying effect induced by zonal advection of the low-level winter mean moisture by MJO winds. The low-level mean moisture pattern over the MC tends to closely follow local topography, with moisture maxima collocated with local mountain peaks. Given this mean moisture distribution, the moisture advection by anomalous easterly MJO winds corresponding to the active MJO convection over the eastern Indian Ocean will lead to a drying (moistening) effect to the east (west) of the mountain peaks. Diagnosis based on hourly output from ERA-5 further illustrates that the diurnal cycle plays a crucial role for the formation of the topographically locked mean moisture pattern over the MC. This study, therefore, indicates that high-resolution models capable of resolving detailed topography and associated diurnal cycle over the MC could be necessary for realistic depiction of the interaction between the MC and MJO.

Here, we report on a 150 ks Chandra observation of PSO.J308.0416-21.2339, a z = 6.23 quasar with a merging companion galaxy identified in [C II] and rest-frame UV emission. With 72.3(-8.6)(+9.6) net counts, we find that PSO.J308.0416-21.2339 is powerful (L-X = 2.31(-0.76)(+1.14) x 10(45) erg s(-1) cm(-2) in rest-frame 2.0-10.0 keV) yet soft (spectral power-law index Gamma = 2.39(-0.36)(+0.37) and optical-to-X-ray slope alpha(OX) = -1.41 +/- 0.11). In addition, we detect three hard-energy photons 2 ''.0 to the west of the main quasar, cospatial with the brightest UV emission of the merging companion. As no soft-energy photons are detected in the same area, this is potentially indicative of a highly obscured source. With conservative assumptions, and accounting for both background fluctuations and the extended wings of the quasar's emission, these photons only have a probability P = 0.021 of happening by chance. If confirmed by deeper observations, this system is the first high-redshift quasar and companion individually detected in X-rays and is likely a dual active galactic nucleus.

An Imprint of the Galactic Magnetic Field in the Diffuse Unpolarized Dust Emission	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							POLARIZATION; RADIATION	It is well known that aligned, aspherical dust grains emit polarized radiation and that the degree of polarization depends on the angle. between the interstellar magnetic field and the line of sight (LOS). However, anisotropy of the dust absorption cross sections also modulates the total intensity of the radiation as the viewing geometry changes. We report a detection of this effect in the high Galactic latitude Planck data, finding that the 353 GHz dust intensity per N-H (I) is smaller when the Galactic magnetic field is mostly in the plane of the sky and larger when the field is mostly along the LOS. These variations are of opposite sign and roughly equal magnitude as the changes in polarized intensity per N-H I with phi, as predicted. In principle, the variation in intensity can be used in conjunction with the dust polarization angle to constrain the full 3D orientation of the Galactic magnetic field.

J	Hu, RY				Hu, Renyu			Information in the Reflected-light Spectra of Widely Separated Giant Exoplanets	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; JOVIAN PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; SUPER-EARTH; JUPITER; EVOLUTION; VENUS; MASS	Giant exoplanets located > 1 au away from their parent stars have atmospheric environments cold enough for water or ammonia clouds. We have developed a new equilibrium cloud and reflected-light spectrum model, ExoREL, for widely separated giant exoplanets. The model includes the dissolution of ammonia in liquid-water cloud droplets, an effect studied for the first time for exoplanets. While preserving the causal relationship between temperature and cloud condensation, ExoREL is simple and fast to enable efficient exploration of parameter space. Using the model, we find that the mixing ratio of methane and the cloud top pressure of a giant exoplanet can be uniquely determined from a single observation of its reflected-light spectrum at wavelengths less than 1 mu m if it has a cloud deck deeper than similar to 0.3 bar. This measurement is enabled by the weak and strong bands of methane and requires a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. The cloud pressure, once derived, provides information about the internal heat flux of the planet. Importantly, we find that for a low, Uranus-like internal heat flux, the planet can have a deep liquid-water cloud, which will sequester ammonia and prevent the formation of the ammonia cloud that would otherwise be the uppermost cloud layer. This newly identified phenomenon causes a strong sensitivity of the cloud top pressure to the internal heat flux. Reflected-light spectroscopy from future direct-imaging missions should therefore not only measure the atmospheric abundances but also characterize the thermal evolution of giant exoplanets.

Due to their short lifespan, we expect a very low rate of such events in elliptical hosts, where the star formation rate is low, and which are mostly comprised of an old stellar population. SN 2016hil (iPTF16hil) is an SN II located in the extreme outskirts of an elliptical galaxy at z.=.0.0608 (projected distance 27.2 kpc). It was detected near peak (M-r similar to -17 mag) 9 days after the last non-detection. The event has some potentially peculiar properties: it presented an apparently double-peaked light curve, and its spectra suggest low metallicity content (Z < 0.4 Z(circle dot)). We place a tentative upper limit on the mass of a potential faint host at log M/M-circle dot = 7.27(-0.24)(+0.43) using deep optical imaging from Keck/LRIS. In light of this, we discuss the possibility of the progenitor forming locally and other more exotic formation scenarios such as a merger or common-envelope evolution causing a time-delayed explosion. Further observations of the explosion site in the UV are needed in order to distinguish between the cases. Regardless of the origin of the transient, observing a population of such seemingly hostless SNe II could have many uses, including an estimate the amount of faint galaxies in a given volume, and tests of the prediction of a time-delayed population of core-collapse SNe in locations otherwise unfavorable for the detection of such events.

The Broadband X-Ray Spectrum of the X-Ray-obscured Type 1 AGN 2MASX J193013.80+341049.5	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; XMM-NEWTON; RESOLUTION; EMISSION; GALAXIES; SAMPLE; DUST; LINE	We present results from modeling the broadband X-ray spectrum of the Type 1 active galactic nucleus (AGN) 2MASX J193013.80+341049.5 using NuSTAR, Swift, and archival XMM-Newton observations. We find this source to be highly X-ray obscured, with column densities exceeding 10(23) cm(-2) across all epochs of X-ray observations, spanning an 8 yr period. However, the source exhibits prominent broad optical emission lines, consistent with an unobscured Type 1 AGN classification. We fit the X-ray spectra with both phenomenological reflection models and physically motivated torus models to model the X-ray absorption. We examine the spectral energy distribution of this source and investigate some possible scenarios to explain the mismatch between X-ray and optical classifications. We compare the ratio of reddening to X-ray absorbing column density (EB-V/N-H) and find that 2MASX J193013.80+341049.5 likely has a much lower dust-to-gas ratio relative to the Galactic interstellar medium, suggesting that the broad line region itself could provide the source of extra X-ray obscuration, being composed of low-ionization, dust-free gas.

The Contribution of Galaxies to the 3.4 mu m Cosmic Infrared Background as Measured Using WISE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							LIGHT; DIRBE; DENSITY; SPITZER; 2MASS; CIRB	The study of the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the optical and near-infrared has received a lot of attention in the last decade, especially near the wavelength lambda approximate to 3.4 mu m, with remaining tension among different techniques for estimating the background. In this paper we present a measurement of the contribution of galaxies to the EBL at 3.4 mu m that is based on the measurement of the luminosity function (LF) in Lake et al. and the mean spectral energy distribution of galaxies in Lake & Wright. The mean and standard deviation of our most reliable Bayesian posterior chain gives a 3.4 mu m background of I-nu = 9.0 +/- 0.5 kJy sr(-1) (nu I-nu = 8.0 +/- 0.4 nW m(-2) sr(-1) e-fold(-1)), with systematic uncertainties unlikely to be greater than 2 kJy sr(-1). This result is higher than most previous efforts to measure the contribution of galaxies to the 3.4 mu m EBL, but is consistent with the upper limits placed by blazars and the most recent direct measurements of the total 3.4 mu m EBL.

Due to self-absorption, the opacity of cold atomic hydrogen may be high, and this gas may constitute an important mass component of the interstellar medium. Atomic hydrogen gas can be cooled to temperatures much lower than found in the cold neutral medium through collisions with molecular hydrogen. In this paper, we search for H I narrow self-absorption (HINSA) features in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as an indicator of such cold H I clouds, and use the results to quantify atomic masses and atomic-to-molecular gas ratio. Our search for HINSA features was conducted toward molecular clouds in the LMC using the ATCA+Parkes H I survey and the MAGMA CO survey. HINSA features are prevalent in the surveyed sightlines. This is the first detection of HINSA in an external galaxy. The HINS-AH HI/H-2 ratio in the LMC varies from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 3.4 x 10(-3) (68% interval), with a mean value of (1.31 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3), after correcting for the effect of foreground H I gas. This is similar to the Milky Way value and indicates that similar fractions of cold gas exist in the LMC and the Milky Way, despite their differing metallicities, dust content and radiation fields. The low ratio also confirms that, as with the Milky Way, the formation timescale of molecular clouds is short. The ratio shows no radial gradient, unlike the case for stellar metallicity. No correlation is found between our results and those from previous H I absorption studies of the LMC.

Measurements of volatile abundance in Semarkona chondrules suggest that chondrules formed in a dense clump that had a higher solid density than the gas density in the solar nebula. We investigate collisions between chondrules and matrix in the surface region of dense clumps using fluffy aggregate growth models. Our simulations show that the collisional growth of aggregates composed of chondrules and matrix takes place in the clumps well before they experience gravitational collapse. The internal structure of chondrite parent bodies (CPBs) can be thereby determined by aggregate growth. We find that the aggregate growth generates two scales within CPBs. The first scale is involved with the small-scale distribution of chondrules and determined by the early growth stage, where chondrules accrete aggregates composed of matrix grains. This accretion can reproduce the thickness of the matrix layer around chondrules found in chondrites. The other scale is related to the large-scale distribution of chondrules. Its properties (e.g., the abundance of chondrules and the overall size) depend on the gas motion within the clump, which is parameterized in this work. Our work thus suggests that the internal structure of CPBs may provide important clues about their formation conditions and mechanisms.

In this work, we develop a simple yet physically motivated framework for modeling the line emission as would be observed in LIM experiments. It is done by building on analytic models of the cosmic infrared background that connect total infrared luminosity of galaxies to their host dark matter halos. We present models of the H I 21 cm, CO (1-0), [C II] 158 mu m, and [N II] 122 and 205 mu m lines consistent with current observational constraints. With four case studies of various combinations of these lines that probe different ISM phases, we demonstrate the potential for reliably extracting physical properties of the ISM, and the evolution of these properties with cosmic time, from auto- and cross-correlation analysis of these lines as measured by future LIM experiments.

A Subcritical Water Extractor Prototype for Potential Astrobiology Spaceflight Missions	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						astrobiology; Atacama Desert; capillary electrophoresis; life detection; subcritical water extraction	AMINO-ACIDS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; MARS; SEARCH; TEMPERATURES; LIFE; UREY	A top-level NASA exploration goal is the search for signs of life beyond Earth. Molecular biosignatures can be sought via in situ organic chemical analyses of samples collected from planetary bodies. Current spaceflight-ready technologies lack the required sensitivity to perform these analyses on key polar organic species primarily due to the low efficiency of transferring these molecules from natural samples into chemical instrumentation. One promising approach to improve the liberation of these molecules from sample matrices prior to analysis is through the use of liquid extraction, in which organic molecules are dissolved in heated, pressurized water. This process has never been performed on a spaceflight mission. As part of instrument maturation efforts, we describe the development of the first spaceflight prototype of a fully automated subcritical water extractor designed to provide this essential functionality on a potential future planetary mission. The prototype extractor was mounted on a Mars test rover platform and successfully operated remotely in the Atacama Desert, Chile. Samples acquired by the rover's drill and sample acquisition/delivery system were remotely transferred to the extractor inlet funnel, and all subsequent extractor operations were performed automatically. To validate the instrument and demonstrate its suitability as a front-end unit for an organic analyzer, we tested low-bioload Atacama Desert soil extracts for amino acid content using capillary electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence. We show that hot extraction under subcritical conditions is required to liberate amino acids from the sample, as no amino acids were found in the extract produced at room temperature. Plain Language Summary The search for signs of life beyond Earth is one of NASA's highest priorities. One powerful way to look for extraterrestrial life is to perform chemical analyses on planetary samples in order to characterize any organic molecules present. Past and current spaceflight instruments analyze various components in gases collected or gases produced from solid samples; however, the instruments either lack the sensitivity to detect organic molecules or the instruments destroy many of the organic molecules during the preparation required to perform a gas-phase-based measurement. This work presents an automated pressurized hot water extractor that can be used to release organic molecules from a solid sample. Pressurized hot water is a powerful and easy-to-handle solvent for a wide range of different compounds. The extractor acts as a front-end instrument and prepares the sample for highly sensitive, liquid-based analysis. This automated and remotely controlled prototype has been successfully tested on a simulated Mars rover mission in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Extracts of the Atacama soil samples were then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence to determine the extracts' amino acid content, as amino acids are an auspicious class of molecules in the search for life.

The existing methods for discovery of RiPPs by combining genome mining and computational mass spectrometry are limited to discovering specific classes of RiPPs from small datasets, and these methods fail to handle unknown post-translational modifications. Here, we present MetaMiner, a software tool for addressing these challenges that is compatible with large-scale screening platforms for natural product discovery. After searching millions of spectra in the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking infrastructure against just eight genomic and metagenomic datasets, MetaMiner discovered 31 known and seven unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities, including human microbiome and lichen microbiome, and microorganisms isolated from the International Space Station.

Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of Al and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. We found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot's internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines.

Prior studies illustrated the critical role of ice shelf melt and iceberg calving based on cliff height in driving the retreat of Thwaites glacier. Here, we simulate its evolution with various calving laws and rates of frontal melt by the ocean in the absence of a buttressing ice shelf. Over the next century, we find that volume losses increase by 15-160% with a von Mises calving law compared to the case where the initial ice shelf is kept and the ice front is fixed at its current position, 10-20% with a buoyancy-driven calving law, and 5-50% with frontal melt caused by ocean thermal forcing. Bed topography exerts the ultimate control on the evolution of Thwaites. In all simulations, once Thwaites Glacier retreats past the western subglacial ridge, the retreat becomes rapidly unstoppable.

To better understand water vapor near-UV absorption, we constructed a cavity ring-down spectrometer with bandwidth of 5 cm(-1) (similar to 0.05 nm) and obtained water vapor absorption cross sections at 1-nm increments in the 290- to 350-nm region. Water vapor displays structured absorption over this range with maximum and minimum cross sections of 8.4 x 10(-25) and 1.6 x 10(-25) cm(2)/molecule. Major water vapor absorption bands were observed at 293-295, 307-313, 319, 321-322, and 325 nm, with cross-section values higher than 4.0 x 10(-25) cm(2)/molecule. To obtain further insight into major water vapor absorption bands, we measured water vapor absorption cross sections at 0.05-nm intervals in the 292- to 296-nm, 306- to 314-nm, and 317- to 326-nm region. Field UV residual spectra not only exhibited increased attenuation at higher atmospheric water vapor loadings but also showed structures suggested by the laboratory water vapor absorption spectrum. Spaceborne UV radiance spectra have spectral structures resembling the differential cross-section spectrum constructed from the laboratory wavelength-dependent water vapor absorption cross sections presented here. Incorporating water vapor absorption cross-section data into a radiative transfer model yielded an estimated energy budget of 0.26 W/m(2) for the standard U.S. atmosphere and 0.76 W/m(2) for the tropics. This shows that water vapor near-UV absorption is an important contributor for climate simulation and ozone retrievals.

Towards accurate methane point-source quantification from high-resolution 2-D plume imagery	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; EMISSION RATES; AIRBORNE	Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas in the Earth climate system but emission quantification of localized point sources has been proven challenging, resulting in ambiguous regional budgets and source category distributions. Although recent advancements in airborne remote sensing instruments enable retrievals of methane enhancements at an unprecedented resolution of 1-5m at regional scales, emission quantification of individual sources can be limited by the lack of knowledge of local wind speed. Here, we developed an algorithm that can estimate flux rates solely from mapped methane plumes, avoiding the need for ancillary information on wind speed. The algorithm was trained on synthetic measurements using large eddy simulations under a range of background wind speeds of 1-10 m s(-1) and source emission rates ranging from 10 to 1000 kg h(-1). The surrogate measurements mimic plume mapping performed by the next-generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) and provide an ensemble of 2-D snapshots of column methane enhancements at 5m spatial resolution. We make use of the integrated total methane enhancement in each plume, denoted as integrated methane enhancement (IME), and investigate how this IME relates to the actual methane flux rate. Our analysis shows that the IME corresponds to the flux rate nonlinearly and is strongly dependent on the background wind speed over the plume. We demonstrate that the plume width, defined based on the plume angular distribution around its main axis, provides information on the associated background wind speed. This allows us to invert source flux rate based solely on the IME and the plume shape itself. On average, the error estimate based on randomly generated plumes is approximately 30% for an individual estimate and less than 10% for an aggregation of 30 plumes. A validation against a natural gas controlled-release experiment agrees to within 32 %, supporting the basis for the applicability of this technique to quantifying point sources over large geographical areas in airborne field campaigns and future space-based observations.

Our results are consistent with widespread water ice at latitudes as low as 35 degrees N/45 degrees S buried sometimes a few centimeters below sand-like material, with high lateral ice depth variability, and correlated with periglacial features. While several investigations have already predicted, identified, and characterized some properties of near-surface ice on Mars, our results constitute a significant advance in the context of the upcoming crewed exploration because (1) they focus on very shallow depths accessible with limited equipment, (2) they provide continuous regional coverage including the midlatitudes, and (3) they yield moderate spatial resolution maps (3 ppd) relevant to landing site selection studies.

Landslides on Ceres: Diversity and Geologic Context	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						asteroids; ices; landslides; Ceres	IN-FLIGHT CALIBRATION; WATER ICE; ROCK GLACIERS; AVALANCHES; MOBILITY; REPOSE	Landslides are among the most widespread geologic features on Ceres. Using data from Dawn's Framing Camera, landslides were previously classified based upon geomorphologic characteristics into one of three archetypal categories, Type 1(T1), Type 2 (T2), and Type 3 (T3). Due to their geologic context, variation in age, and physical characteristics, most landslides on Ceres are, however, intermediate in their morphology and physical properties between the archetypes of each landslide class. Here we describe the varied morphology of individual intermediate landslides, identify geologic controls that contribute to this variation, and provide first-order quantification of the physical properties of the continuum of Ceres's surface flows. These intermediate flows appear in varied settings and show a range of characteristics, including those found at contacts between craters, those having multiple trunks or lobes; showing characteristics of both T2 and T3 landslides; material slumping on crater rims; very small, ejecta-like flows; and those appearing inside of catenae. We suggest that while their morphologies can vary, the distribution and mechanical properties of intermediate landslides do not differ significantly from that of archetypal landslides, confirming a link between landslides and subsurface ice. We also find that most intermediate landslides are similar to Type 2 landslides and formed by shallow failure. Clusters of these features suggest ice enhancement near Juling, Kupalo and Urvara craters. Since the majority of Ceres's landslides fall in the intermediate landslide category, placing their attributes in context contributes to a better understanding of Ceres's shallow subsurface and the nature of ground ice.

It is found that the cold bias is controlled by the biases of surface radiative fluxes, and the underestimated ice water path has significant contribution to the radiation biases. In addition, after removing the impact of snow albedo feedback, the relation between the biases of residual surface temperature and ice water path can be revealed. A set of sensitivity experiments with fully coupled Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) is performed to identify the impact of the precipitating ice radiative effect on biases of the surface energy budget and temperature. When this effect is turned off, more solar radiation can penetrate through the optically thin atmosphere, while much less downward longwave radiation owing to missing of emission from falling snow. The high spatial coherency between the changes in surface radiation budget and surface temperature suggests that the cold bias over the Tibetan Plateau could be partly attributed to deficiency of the total downward radiative flux due to the lack of precipitating ice. The inclusion of the precipitating ice radiative effect can reduce the model biases of surface radiative fluxes and surface temperature.

Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally: Spatial Distributions and Temporal Evolution of Life Cycle Characteristics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							US WEST-COAST; NORTH PACIFIC; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; ALGORITHM; EVENTS; IDENTIFICATION; CYCLONES; FLOODS; SCALE	The Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally as Elongated Targets (tARget) algorithm is further developed to Version 3, adding the capability to track atmospheric river (AR) life cycles along with other refinement. The results indicate AR genesis is more frequent toward the western boundaries of midlatitude ocean basins and nearby upstream land areas (similar to 1 month(-1)) compared to the eastern boundaries (similar to 0.5 month(-1)) and least frequent in tropical and polar areas (reaching toward 0). AR termination is more frequent toward the northeastern sectors of North Pacific/Atlantic and adjacent downstream land areas and in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica (similar to 1 month(-1)) compared to the adjacent ocean sectors (similar to 0.5 month(-1)) and least frequent in tropical areas and interior Antarctica where AR genesis is similarly infrequent. ARs tend to be longer-lived when the genesis (termination) occurs toward the western (eastern) boundaries of midlatitude ocean basins and adjacent land areas (maximum lifetime >72 hr) compared to the opposite side of the ocean basins (24-72 hr) and when terminated at high latitudes. AR travel speed is higher in the midlatitude ocean basins and strongly steered by the zonal wind around 650 hPa. AR tracks are nearly linear in most cases, with the overall travel direction closely correlated with the direction of integrated water vapor transport (r = 0.69) although being more zonal than the latter. Temporally, ARs tend to be longer/stronger around the middle of the life cycle. Seasonal variations in AR life cycle characteristics are also examined. The handling of AR separations/mergers contributes the largest sensitivity in tracking result compared to selection/resolution of input data.

Comparison of Near-Surface NO2 Pollution With Pandora Total Column NO2 During the Korea-United States Ocean Color (KORUS OC) Campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							OMI OBSERVATIONS; LAYER HEIGHT; AIR-QUALITY; OZONE; SATELLITE; EMISSION; RETRIEVALS	Near-surface air quality (AQ) observations over coastal waters are scarce, a situation that limits our capacity to monitor pollution events at land-water interfaces. Satellite measurements of total column (TC) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations are a useful proxy for combustion sources, but the once daily snapshots available from most sensors are insufficient for tracking the diurnal evolution and transport of pollution. Ground-based remote sensors like the Pandora Spectrometer Instrument (PSI) that have been developed to verify space-based TC NO2 and other trace gases are being tested for routine use as certified AQ monitors. The KORUS-OC (Korea-United States Ocean Color) cruise aboard the R/V Onnuri in May-June 2016 represented an opportunity to study AQ near the South Korean coast, a region affected by both local/regional and long-distance pollution sources. Using PSI data in direct-Sun mode and in situ sensors for shipboard ozone, CO, and NO2, we explore, for the first time, relationships between TC NO2 and surface AQ in this coastal region. Three case studies illustrate the value of the PSI and complexities in the surface-column NO2 relationship caused by varying meteorological conditions. Case Study 1 (25-26 May 2016) exhibited a high correlation of surface NO2 to TC NO2 measured by both PSI and Aura's Ozone Monitoring Instrument, but two other cases displayed poor relationships between in situ and TC NO2 due to decoupling of pollution layers from the surface. With suitable interpretation the PSI TC NO2 measurement demonstrates good potential for working with upcoming geostationary satellites to advance diurnal tracking of pollution.

We find that the Amery region is near balance, while the Getz region is rapidly losing mass. We compare the results with the mass budget method (MBM) combining ice discharge along the periphery with surface mass balance derived from three regional climate models: (1) Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO) 2.3p1 and (2) 2.3p2, and (3) Modele Atmospherique Regional 3.6.41. For Amery, MBM/RACMO2.3p1 agrees with GRACE, while MBM/RACMO2.3p2 and MBM/MAR3.6.41 suggest a positive mass balance. For Getz, all estimates agree with a mass loss and the GRACE results are robust to uncertainties in glacial isostatic adjustment derived from an ensemble 128,000 forward models. Over the period April 2002 to November 2015, the mass loss of the Getz drainage basin is 22.9 +/- 10.9 Gt/yr with an acceleration of 1.6 +/- 0.9 Gt/yr(2).

Assessing change in the overturning behavior of the Laurentian Great Lakes using remotely sensed lake surface water temperatures	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Laurentian Great Lakes; Overturning; Dimictic lake; Lake surface water temperature; Thermal front; Thermal bar; Lake stratification	THERMAL STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICHIGAN; BAR; STRATIFICATION; CIRCULATION; DYNAMICS; SUPERIOR; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESERVOIRS	Most large temperate lakes experience overturning every spring and fall as surface water moves past 4 degrees C, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater. These semiannual, lake-wide overturning events play an important role regulating the thermal structure, deep-water ventilation, nutrient supply, water circulation, and nearshore water quality of the lakes. The general pattern of overturning has long been known from field observations and models, but its timing, duration, detailed spatio-temporal progression and seasonal and inter-annual variability remain largely undocumented, particularly in the context of recent climate-driven changes in lake thermal dynamics. Here, we used a reconstructed record of daily and spatially-explicit lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) to analyze the migration of the 4 degrees C thermal front as it progressed from the shorelines to the deep parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes during every overturning event between June 1995 to April 2012. The analysis revealed a strong asymmetry in the timing and duration of overturning between spring and fall, and no relationship with the lake-averaged LSWT or its rate of change. Key differences in the average spatio-temporal progression of overturning were also observed between spring and fall, with the spring progression being largely driven by latitude and water depth and the fall progression being less predictable and influenced by other factors such as wind. Narrow regions of very slow overturning progression were also identified, revealing areas of the lakes where persistent 4 degrees C thermal bars are likely to re-occur every year. The timing and duration of these seasonal overturning events varied between years by as much as one and two months, respectively, with a direct impact on the duration of lake-wide stratification. In 2012, Lakes Michigan and Ontario experienced an incomplete fall overturning, leading only to a partial winter stratification. Lakes Michigan and Ontario were more susceptible to experience an incomplete overturning than the other Laurentian Great Lakes, seemingly due to a combination of comparatively milder winter air temperatures and lower lake dynamic ratio (steepness of bottom slope). Overall, the duration of lake-wide winter stratification was found to be strongly correlated with mean winter air temperatures, and a simple trend analysis suggested that rising temperatures could lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter stratifications in Lakes Michigan and Ontario over the next few decades. This study demonstrated that remote sensing provides an unparalleled tool for assessing the long-term variability in the overturning behavior of large lakes in the context of climate change.

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time-evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5.

Probing the energetic particle environment near the Sun	NATURE			English	Article							SOLAR-WIND; PROPAGATION	NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission(1) recently plunged through the inner heliosphere of the Sun to its perihelia, about 24 million kilometres from the Sun. Previous studies farther from the Sun (performed mostly at a distance of 1 astronomical unit) indicate that solar energetic particles are accelerated from a few kiloelectronvolts up to near-relativistic energies via at least two processes: 'impulsive' events, which are usually associated with magnetic reconnection in solar flares and are typically enriched in electrons, helium-3 and heavier ions(2), and 'gradual' events(3,4), which are typically associated with large coronal-mass-ejection-driven shocks and compressions moving through the corona and inner solar wind and are the dominant source of protons with energies between 1 and 10 megaelectronvolts. However, some events show aspects of both processes and the electron-proton ratio is not bimodally distributed, as would be expected if there were only two possible processes(5). These processes have been very difficult to resolve from prior observations, owing to the various transport effects that affect the energetic particle population en route to more distant spacecraft(6). Here we report observations of the near-Sun energetic particle radiation environment over the first two orbits of the probe. We find a variety of energetic particle events accelerated both locally and remotely including by corotating interaction regions, impulsive events driven by acceleration near the Sun, and an event related to a coronal mass ejection. We provide direct observations of the energetic particle radiation environment in the region just above the corona of the Sun and directly explore the physics of particle acceleration and transport.

Near-Sun observations of an F-corona decrease and K-corona fine structure	NATURE			English	Article							MASS EJECTION; DUST; DYNAMICS; LIGHT	Remote observations of the solar photospheric light scattered by electrons (the K-corona) and dust (the F-corona or zodiacal light) have been made from the ground during eclipses(1) and from space at distances as small as 0.3 astronomical units(2-5) to the Sun. Previous observations(6-8) of dust scattering have not confirmed the existence of the theoretically predicted dust-free zone near the Sun(9-11). The transient nature of the corona has been well characterized for large events, but questions still remain (for example, about the initiation of the corona(12) and the production of solar energetic particles(13)) and for small events even its structure is uncertain(14). Here we report imaging of the solar corona(15) during the first two perihelion passes (0.16-0.25 astronomical units) of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft(13), each lasting ten days. The view from these distances is qualitatively similar to the historical views from ground and space, but there are some notable differences. At short elongations, we observe a decrease in the intensity of the F-coronal intensity, which is suggestive of the long-sought dust free zone(9-11). We also resolve the fine-scale plasma structure of very small eruptions, which are frequently ejected from the Sun. These take two forms: the frequently observed magnetic flux ropes(12,16) and the predicted, but not yet observed, magnetic islands(17,18) arising from the tearing-mode instability in the current sheet. Our observations of the coronal streamer evolution confirm the large-scale topology of the solar corona, but also reveal that, as recently predicted(19), streamers are composed of yet smaller substreamers channelling continual density fluctuations at all visible scales.

Here, we demonstrate a new optical clock system based on an array of individually trapped neutral atoms with single-atom readout, merging many of the benefits of ion and lattice clocks as well as creating a bridge to recently developed techniques in quantum simulation and computing with neutral atoms. We evaluate single-site-resolved frequency shifts and short-term stability via self-comparison. Atom-by-atom feedback control enables direct experimental estimation of laser noise contributions. Results agree well with an ab initio Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates finite temperature, projective readout, laser noise, and feedback dynamics. Our approach, based on a tweezer array, also suppresses interaction shifts while retaining a short dead time, all in a comparatively simple experimental setup suited for transportable operation. These results establish the foundations for a third optical clock platform and provide a novel starting point for entanglement-enhanced metrology, quantum clock networks, and applications in quantum computing and communication with individual neutral atoms that require optical-clock-state control.

Instantaneous Antarctic ice sheet mass loss driven by thinning ice shelves	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Glaciology; Antartica; Ice-flow modelling	GLACIER; RETREAT; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; SECTOR; FLOW	Recent observations show that the rate at which the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) is contributing to sea level rise is increasing. Increases in ice-ocean heat exchange have the potential to induce substantial mass loss through the melting of its ice shelves. Lack of data and limitations in modeling, however, has made it challenging to quantify the importance of ocean-induced changes in ice shelf thickness as a driver for ongoing mass loss. Here, we use a numerical ice sheet model in combination with satellite observations of ice shelf thinning from 1994 to 2017 to quantify instantaneous changes in ice flow across all AIS grounding lines, resulting from changes in ice shelf buttressing alone. Our process-based predictions are in good agreement with observed spatial patterns of ice loss, providing support for the notion that a significant portion of the current ice loss of the AIS is ocean driven and caused by a reduction in ice shelf buttressing.

Geometric constraints are derived and are used to evaluate the fitness of several periodic orbit families in the sun-Earth and sun-Mars circular-restricted three-body systems. It is determined that Mars Trojan orbits provide the best solution. Families of these orbits are presented and studied for stability in a multibody model. It is shown that with no station-keeping, appropriately chosen orbits satisfy the geometric telecommunication constraints for decades. Outbound transfer costs from Earth and orbit insertion costs are computed in both Keplerian and ephemeris-level multibody regimes. The use of an outbound Mars flyby significantly lowers the orbit insertion cost.

Strong Excess Faraday Rotation on the Inside of the Sagittarius Spiral Arm	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article							GALACTIC PLANE; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SUPERBUBBLES; CATALOG; THIN	We present first results for Faraday rotation of compact polarized sources (1-2 GHz continuum) in The HI/OH/Recombination line (THOR) survey of the inner Galaxy. In the Galactic longitude range 39 degrees < l < 52 degrees, we find rotation measures (RMs) in the range -310 rad m(-2) <= RM <= +4219 rad m(-2), with the highest values concentrated within a degree of l = 48 degrees at the Sagittarius arm tangent. Most of the high RMs arise in diffuse plasma, along lines of sight that do not intersect H II regions. For l > 49 degrees, RM drops off rapidly, while at l < 47 degrees, the mean RM is higher with a larger standard deviation than at l > 49 degrees. We attribute the RM structure to the compressed diffuse warm ionized medium in the spiral arm, upstream of the major star formation regions. The Sagittarius arm acts as a significant Faraday screen inside the Galaxy. This has implications for models of the Galactic magnetic field and the expected amount of Faraday rotation of fast radio bursts from their host galaxies. We emphasize the importance of sensitivity to high Faraday depth in future polarization surveys.	[Shanahan, R.; Lemmer, S. J.; Stil, J.

W.; Kuchner, Marc			Disentangling Planets from Photoelectric Instability in Gas-rich Optically Thin Dusty Disks	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							DEBRIS DISKS; MASS; GRAINS; RINGS	Structures in circumstellar disks such as gaps and rings are often attributed to planets. This connection has been difficult to show unequivocally, as other processes may also produce these features. In particular, a photoelectric instability (PEI) has been proposed, operating in gas-rich optically thin disks, that generates structures predicted by planet-disk interactions. We examine the question of how to disentangle the planetary effects on disk structure from the effects of the PEI. We use the PENCIL CODE to perform 2D global hydrodynamical models of the dynamics of gas and dust in a thin disk with and without planetary perturbers. Photoelectric heating is modeled with an equation of state where pressure is proportional to dust surface density. The drag force on grains and its backreaction on the gas are included. Analyzing the situation without PEI, we find that gas-dust interactions alter the shape of the planetary gap from the dust-free case when the local dust-to-gas ratio epsilon approaches unity. This result also applies to primordial disks, because dust drifting inward accumulates at the edge of the planetary gap, and any initial dust-to-gas ratio eventually achieves epsilon = 1 if the dust reservoir is sufficient. We find a result particular to high dust-to-gas ratio disks as well: as dust drifts inward, the dust front becomes a sharp transition, and the backreaction triggers the Rossby wave instability. When PEI is included, we find that it obscures structures induced by planets unless the planet's mass is sufficiently large to carve a noticeable gap. Specifically, the instability generates arcs and rings of regular spacing: a planet is discernible when it carves a dust gap wider than the wavelength of the PEI.

The NuSTAR and Swift X-Ray Telescope observations obtained in 2015-2017 contributed to the successful identification of five persistent sources. Here, we report on the spectral and variability analyses that helped to consolidate the classifications of IGR J10447-6027, IGR J16181-5407, and IGR J20569+4940 as active galactic nuclei and IGR J17402-3656 as an intermediate polar. An optical spectrum of the blazar IGR J20569 +4940 is also presented. Combining these results with successful identifications of other such faint and persistent INTEGRAL sources reported in the literature, we investigate possible implications for the population of persistent highmass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) below the identification completion limit of the INTEGRAL survey. The current trend hints at a deficit of persistent HMXBs below F17-60 keV = 10(-1)1 erg cm(-2) s(-1), but additional efforts dedicated to classifying faint hard X-ray sources are needed before we can draw solid conclusions.

J	Goldsmith, PF				Goldsmith, Paul F.			Modeling Collisional Excitation of [OI] Fine Structure Line Emission from PDRs. I. Homogeneous Clouds	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ATOMIC OXYGEN ABUNDANCE; 63 MU-M; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; STRUCTURE TRANSITIONS; ABSORPTION; MICRON; SPECTROSCOPY; REGIONS; LWS; C+	Atomic oxygen (O-0) plays a critical role in determining the structure of photon-dominated regions (PDRs), but reliable modeling of its emission has been hampered by the high optical depth of the 63 mu m fine structure line and complexities in the excitation of the relevant fine structure levels. We discuss here radiation produced by collisional excitation of the submillimeter fine structure lines of atomic oxygen ([O I]) using recent calculations of rates for collisions with atomic and molecular hydrogen. We employ the Molpop-CEP code to include the effects of optical thickness in slab models that are characterized by uniform oxygen abundance, hydrogen density, and kinetic temperature. The particular spontaneous decay rates and collisional excitation rates connecting the three O0 fine structure levels result in population inversion of the upper, 145 mu m transition. The effects of trapping are rigorously included and are reflected in the resulting line profiles that exhibit prominent self-absorption even with uniform physical conditions. We present figures for analyzing the two fine structure lines based on the intensity of the 63 mu m line and the 145 mu m/63 mu m line ratio. For the clouds considered, the results for line intensities and line ratios are modestly different from those obtained with a large-velocity-gradient model, but the ability to calculate line profiles is an additional powerful tool. Comparison of the model results with observed line profiles suggests that cloud models with varying physical conditions are required to optimally utilize [O I] fine structure line emission to trace the energetics of PDR regions and the feedback from massive, young stars.

A Statistical Approach to Planetesimal Condensate Composition beyond the Snowline Based on the Carbon-to-oxygen Ratio	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							GIANT PLANETS; SOLAR-SYSTEM; OCEAN; ORIGIN; STARS; DISK; RICH	The ratio between carbon and oxygen is regarded as an important driver of circumstellar and planetary chemistry, which can be used as a parameter to estimate the fractionation among refractory and volatile portions of a planet. From this motivation, nearly 500 stars including some with planets discovered around them are investigated. The relation between the C/O ratio and fractions of icy and refractory species is traced for planetesimals expected to form in their protostellar disks. It is found that low C/O ratios lead to planets rich in ice, but poor in organic and other refractory materials. With increasing C/O ratios, the ice fraction diminishes, where organics increase and other refractory materials dominate. Apart from that, the carbon portion incorporated in the solid phase and the redox state of the environment are altered to analyze their influence on bulk formation for generated planets. Under zero solid carbon contribution, ice formation decreases and refractory formation increases with increasing C/O ratio. When the carbon contribution is considered to be entirely in the solid phase, refractory materials are not significantly affected by the increasing C/O ratio while ice may even disappear. For reducing conditions, the C/O ratio is not an obstacle for ice formation no matter how high it is. Under oxidizing conditions, however, water is not found where the C/O ratio is greater than 0.8. Bulk densities are also calculated according to alternative scenarios along with compositional distributions, and results are compared to solar system objects. This study, therefore, exemplifies how a simple correlation can be drawn between stellar chemistry, redox state, and planetesimal composition.	[Pekmezci, G.

The Nature of Ionized Gas in the Milky Way Galactic Fountain	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							HIGH-VELOCITY CLOUDS; COLUMN DENSITIES; STAR-FORMATION; DUST EMISSION; O-VI; ABSORPTION; COMPLEX; DISTANCES; HALO; GALAXY	We address the spatial scale, ionization structure, mass, and metal content of gas at the Milky Way disk-halo interface detected as absorption in the foreground of seven closely spaced, high-latitude halo blue horizontal branch stars with heights z = 3-14 kpc. We detect transitions that trace multiple ionization states (e.g., Ca II, Fe II, Si IV, C IV) with column densities that remain constant with height from the disk, indicating that the gas most likely lies within z < 3.4 kpc. The intermediate ionization state gas traced by C IV and Si IV is strongly correlated over the full range of transverse separations probed by our sight lines, indicating large, coherent structures greater than 1 kpc in size. The low ionization state material traced by Ca II and Fe II does not exhibit a correlation with either N-H (I) or transverse separation, implying cloudlets or clumpiness on scales less than 10 pc. We find that the observed ratio log(N-Si IV/N-C IV), with a median value of -0.69 +/- 0.04, is sensitive to the total carbon content of the ionized gas under the assumption of either photoionization or collisional ionization. The only self-consistent solution for photoionized gas requires that Si be depleted onto dust by 0.35 dex relative to the solar Si/C ratio, similar to the level of Si depletion in DLAs and in the Milky Way interstellar medium. The allowed range of values for the areal mass infall rate of warm, ionized gas at the disk-halo interface is 0.0003 < dM(gas)/dtdA [M-circle dot kpc(-2) yr(-1)] < 0.006. Our data support a physical scenario in which the Milky Way is fed by complex, multiphase processes at its disk-halo interface that involve kiloparsec-scale ionized envelopes or streams containing parsec-scale, cool clumps.

J	Lyu, MX; Jiang, XN; Wu, ZW				Lyu, Mengxia; Jiang, Xianan; Wu, Zhiwei			A Cautionary Note on the Long-term Trend in Activity of the Madden-Julian Oscillation During the Past Decades	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Madden-Julian Oscillation real-time multivariate MJO index climate trend Arctic amplification	SURFACE AIR-TEMPERATURE; TROPICAL CYCLOGENESIS; MJO; PREDICTION; TELECONNECTIONS; WINTERTIME; PREDICTABILITY; SKILL	Recent studies suggest that frequency of active phases of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) over the Maritime Continent and western Pacific, that is, the MJO Phases 4-6 defined by the real-time multivariate MJO (RMM) index, has increased in recent winters. A robust positive trend in MJO Phase 4-6 days during 1979-2015 winters is confirmed in this study. Our analyses, however, suggest that this trend could be exaggerated due to the blended low-frequency variability signals in the RMM. When the winter RMM is reconstructed using anomalous fields after removing their winter mean instead of the previous 120-day mean as for the original RMM, the robust trend in MJO Phase 4-6 days can no longer be detected. Therefore, cautions need to be exercised when applying the RMM for studies on the low-frequency variability and climate trend in MJO activity and using the derived MJO variability to interpret associated changes in climate systems.

Short-term trends in Africa's freshwater resources: Rates and drivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Africa; GRACE; Freshwater resources; Short-term trends; Natural variabilities; Anthropogenic interventions	GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; STORAGE CHANGES; MODERN RECHARGE; WEST-AFRICA; NORTH-AFRICA; GREATER HORN; GRACE; MODEL; EAST	The freshwater resources in Africa are vulnerable to natural variabilities as well as anthropogenic interventions. In this study, temporal (April 2002-June 2017) Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data are integrated, in a geographic information system environment, with rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration, and altimetry remote sensing datasets to monitor the short-term trends in terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the African hydrogeologic systems and W explore their origins. Results show that short-term trends over the African continent are largely driven by natural variability such as changes in rainfall, evapotranspiration, and associated variations in lake levels. Exceptions to this observation include central Africa, where deforestation is found to additionally drive changes in TWS, as well as northern Africa, where TWS changes are dominated by anthropogenic groundwater extraction from fossil aquifers. Findings highlight the need for integrative responses at local, national regional, and international levels by the African nations to overcome current and future challenges related to freshwater availability in Africa.

Evaluation of a satellite-derived model parameterized by three soil moisture constraints to estimate terrestrial latent heat flux in the Heihe River basin of Northwest China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Terrestrial latent heat flux; MODIS; Soil moisture constraints; Heihe River basin	LAND-SURFACE EVAPORATION; EDDY-COVARIANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ENERGY FLUXES; NET-RADIATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION ESTIMATION; HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE; COMBINING MODIS; WATER-VAPOR; TEMPERATURE	Satellite-derived terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) models are useful tools to understand regional surface energy and water cycle processes for terrestrial ecosystems in the Heihe River basin (HRB) of Northwest China. This study developed a satellite-derived hybrid LE model parameterized by three soil moisture (SM) constraints: SM, relative humidity (RID, and diurnal air temperature range (DT); and assessed model performance and sensitivity. We used MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and eddy covariance (EC) data from 12 EC flux tower sites across the HRB. The hybrid model was trained using observed LE over 2012/ 2013-2014, and validated using observed LE for 2015 and leave-one-out cross-validation. The results show that the three SM constraints schemes exhibited some modeling differences at the flux tower site scale. LE estimation using SM achieved the highest correlation (R-2 - 0.87, p < 0.01) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 20.1 W/m(2)) compared to schemes using RH or DT schemes. We then produced regional daily LE maps at 1 km x 1 km across the HRB for 2013-2015. Regional analysis shows that our LE estimates from all three constraint models exhibited large spatial variability and strong seasonal and annual variations, attributed to differences in parameterizing the model water constraints. This study provides data and model based evidence to improve satellite-derived hybrid LE models with regard to water constraints. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intercomparison of nitrous acid (HONO) measurement techniques in a megacity (Beijing)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; ENHANCED ABSORPTION SPECTROMETER; ANNULAR DENUDER; CROSS-SECTIONS; CENTRAL LONDON; NO2; SUMMER; URBAN; CIMS; N2O5	Nitrous acid (HONO) is a key determinant of the daytime radical budget in the daytime boundary layer, with quantitative measurement required to understand OH radical abundance. Accurate and precise measurements of HONO are therefore needed; however HONO is a challenging compound to measure in the field, in particular in a chemically complex and highly polluted environment. Here we report an intercomparison exercise between HONO measurements performed by two wet chemical techniques (the commercially available a long-path absorption photometer (LOPAP) and a custom-built instrument) and two broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectrophotometer (BBCEAS) instruments at an urban location in Beijing. In addition, we report a comparison of HONO measurements performed by a time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (ToF-CIMS) and a selected ion flow tube mass spectrometer (SIFT-MS) to the more established techniques (wet chemical and BBCEAS). The key finding from the current work was that all instruments agree on the temporal trends and variability in HONO (r(2) > 0.97), yet they displayed some divergence in absolute concentrations, with the wet chemical methods consistently higher overall than the BBCEAS systems by between 12% and 39 %. We found no evidence for any systematic bias in any of the instruments, with the exception of measurements near instrument detection limits. The causes of the divergence in absolute HONO concentrations were unclear, and may in part have been due to spatial variability, i.e. differences in instrument location and/or inlet position, but this observation may have been more associative than casual.

Comparison of Near-Surface NO2 Pollution With Pandora Total Column NO2 During the Korea-United States Ocean Color (KORUS OC) Campaign	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article; Early Access						Pandora spectrometer; KORUS (2016); Korean air pollution; OMI NO2	TROPOSPHERIC NO2; OMI OBSERVATIONS; LAYER HEIGHT; AIR-QUALITY; OZONE; SATELLITE; EMISSION; RETRIEVALS; SO2	Near-surface air quality (AQ) observations over coastal waters are scarce, a situation that limits our capacity to monitor pollution events at land-water interfaces. Satellite measurements of total column (TC) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations are a useful proxy for combustion sources, but the once daily snapshots available from most sensors are insufficient for tracking the diurnal evolution and transport of pollution. Ground-based remote sensors like the Pandora Spectrometer Instrument (PSI) that have been developed to verify space-based TC NO2 and other trace gases are being tested for routine use as certified AQ monitors. The KORUS-OC (Korea-United States Ocean Color) cruise aboard the R/V Onnuri in May-June 2016 represented an opportunity to study AQ near the South Korean coast, a region affected by both local/regional and long-distance pollution sources. Using PSI data in direct-Sun mode and in situ sensors for shipboard ozone, CO, and NO2, we explore, for the first time, relationships between TC NO2 and surface AQ in this coastal region. Three case studies illustrate the value of the PSI and complexities in the surface-column NO2 relationship caused by varying meteorological conditions. Case Study 1 (25-26 May 2016) exhibited a high correlation of surface NO2 to TC NO2 measured by both PSI and Aura's Ozone Monitoring Instrument, but two other cases displayed poor relationships between in situ and TC NO2 due to decoupling of pollution layers from the surface. With suitable interpretation the PSI TC NO2 measurement demonstrates good potential for working with upcoming geostationary satellites to advance diurnal tracking of pollution.

Electron data from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer's Electron Spectrometer (CAPS-ELS) is processed to produce a signal-to-noise ratio for the entire CAPS-ELS time of operation at Saturn's magnetosphere. We investigate where the signal-to-noise ratio falls below 1 to identify regions in the magnetosphere where there is a significant depletion in the electron content. In the nightside equatorial region, we use this to find that the most planetward reconnection x-line location is at 20-25 R-S downtail from the planet in the midnight to dawn sector. We also find an equatorial dawn-dusk asymmetry at a radial distance of >20 R-S, which may indicate the presence of plasma-depleted flux tubes returning to the dayside after reconnection in the tail. Furthermore, we find that the high-latitude magnetosphere is predominantly in a state of constant plasma depletion and located on open field lines. We map the region of high-latitude magnetosphere that is depleted of electrons to the polar cap to estimate the size and open flux content within the polar caps. The mean open flux content for the northern and southern polar caps are found to be 25 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 5 GWb, respectively.

Iron-bearing minerals such as mackinawite, greenalite and fougerite have been investigated as catalysts for protobiotic reactions, including amino acid synthesis. In the field of heterogeneous catalysis, it is well known that defect sites in the crystal structure are often the most active sites for catalysis, and mineral catalysts that have been exposed to ionizing radiation are known to exhibit increased reactivity due to radiation-induced defect sites. In this work, we (i) review the literature on the radioactive environment of the Hadean era, (ii) highlight the role of radionuclide ionizing radiation from U-238, Th-232 and K-40 in generating defect sites with high catalytic activity for the chemical evolution of organic molecules, and (iii) hypothesize that these processes accelerated the emergence of life.

Episodes of particle ejection from the surface of the active asteroid (101955) Bennu	SCIENCE			English	Article							IMPACT; YARKOVSKY; DYNAMICS; REGOLITH; ORIGIN; ORBIT; ICE	Active asteroids are those that show evidence of ongoing mass loss. We report repeated instances of particle ejection from the surface of (101955) Bennu, demonstrating that it is an active asteroid. The ejection events were imaged by the OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer) spacecraft. For the three largest observed events, we estimated the ejected particle velocities and sizes, event times, source regions, and energies. We also determined the trajectories and photometric properties of several gravitationally bound particles that orbited temporarily in the Bennu environment. We consider multiple hypotheses for the mechanisms that lead to particle ejection for the largest events, including rotational disruption, electrostatic lofting, ice sublimation, phyllosilicate dehydration, meteoroid impacts, thermal stress fracturing, and secondary impacts.

Shell potentials for microgravity Bose-Einstein condensates	NPJ MICROGRAVITY			English	Article							ATOMS	Extending the understanding of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) physics to new geometries and topologies has a long and varied history in ultracold atomic physics. One such new geometry is that of a bubble, where a condensate would be confined to the surface of an ellipsoidal shell. Study of this geometry would give insight into new collective modes, self-interference effects, topology-dependent vortex behavior, dimensionality crossovers from thick to thin shells, and the properties of condensates pushed into the ultradilute limit. Here we propose to implement a realistic experimental framework for generating shell-geometry BEC using radiofrequency dressing of magnetically trapped samples. Such a tantalizing state of matter is inaccessible terrestrially due to the distorting effect of gravity on experimentally feasible shell potentials. The debut of an orbital BEC machine (NASA Cold Atom Laboratory, aboard the International Space Station) has enabled the operation of quantum-gas experiments in a regime of perpetual freefall, and thus has permitted the planning of microgravity shell-geometry BEC experiments. We discuss specific experimental configurations, applicable inhomogeneities and other experimental challenges, and outline potential experiments.	[Lundblad, N.; Carollo, R. A.; Gold, M.

We propose a new analysis which can help solve both problems. From the combination of an intensity map with an overlapping galaxy survey, we construct a new one-point statistic which is unbiased by foregrounds and contains information left out of conventional analyses. We show that our method can measure the HI mass function with unprecedented precision using observations similar to recent 21 cm detections.

Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally: Spatial Distributions and Temporal Evolution of Life Cycle Characteristics	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article; Early Access						atmospheric river; life cycle; tracking; reanalysis	US WEST-COAST; NORTH PACIFIC; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; ALGORITHM; EVENTS; IDENTIFICATION; CYCLONES; FLOODS; SCALE	The Tracking Atmospheric Rivers Globally as Elongated Targets (tARget) algorithm is further developed to Version 3, adding the capability to track atmospheric river (AR) life cycles along with other refinement. The results indicate AR genesis is more frequent toward the western boundaries of midlatitude ocean basins and nearby upstream land areas (similar to 1 month(-1)) compared to the eastern boundaries (similar to 0.5 month(-1)) and least frequent in tropical and polar areas (reaching toward 0). AR termination is more frequent toward the northeastern sectors of North Pacific/Atlantic and adjacent downstream land areas and in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica (similar to 1 month(-1)) compared to the adjacent ocean sectors (similar to 0.5 month(-1)) and least frequent in tropical areas and interior Antarctica where AR genesis is similarly infrequent. ARs tend to be longer-lived when the genesis (termination) occurs toward the western (eastern) boundaries of midlatitude ocean basins and adjacent land areas (maximum lifetime >72 hr) compared to the opposite side of the ocean basins (24-72 hr) and when terminated at high latitudes. AR travel speed is higher in the midlatitude ocean basins and strongly steered by the zonal wind around 650 hPa. AR tracks are nearly linear in most cases, with the overall travel direction closely correlated with the direction of integrated water vapor transport (r = 0.69) although being more zonal than the latter. Temporally, ARs tend to be longer/stronger around the middle of the life cycle. Seasonal variations in AR life cycle characteristics are also examined. The handling of AR separations/mergers contributes the largest sensitivity in tracking result compared to selection/resolution of input data.

We confirm in both the MLS and GEOSCCM that the seasonal cycle of water vapor entering the stratosphere is primarily determined by the seasonal cycle of TTL temperatures. However, we find that the seasonal cycle of temperature predicts a smaller seasonal cycle of TTL water vapor between 10 and 40 degrees N than observed by MLS or simulated by the GEOSCCM. Our analysis of the GEOSCCM shows that including evaporation of convective ice in the trajectory model increases both the simulated maximum value of the 100 hPa 10-40 degrees N water vapor seasonal cycle and the seasonal-cycle amplitude. We conclude that the moistening effect from convective ice evaporation in the TTL plays a key role in regulating and maintaining the seasonal cycle of water vapor in the TTL. Most of the convective moistening in the 10-40 degrees N range comes from convective ice evaporation occurring at the same latitudes. A small contribution to the moistening comes from convective ice evaporation occurring between 10 degrees S and 10 degrees N. Within the 10-40 degrees N band, the Asian monsoon region is the most important region for convective moistening by ice evaporation during boreal summer and autumn.

It is found that the cold bias is controlled by the biases of surface radiative fluxes, and the underestimated ice water path has significant contribution to the radiation biases. In addition, after removing the impact of snow albedo feedback, the relation between the biases of residual surface temperature and ice water path can be revealed. A set of sensitivity experiments with fully coupled Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) is performed to identify the impact of the precipitating ice radiative effect on biases of the surface energy budget and temperature. When this effect is turned off, more solar radiation can penetrate through the optically thin atmosphere, while much less downward longwave radiation owing to missing of emission from falling snow. The high spatial coherency between the changes in surface radiation budget and surface temperature suggests that the cold bias over the Tibetan Plateau could be partly attributed to deficiency of the total downward radiative flux due to the lack of precipitating ice. The inclusion of the precipitating ice radiative effect can reduce the model biases of surface radiative fluxes and surface temperature.

We used the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation(AVIRIS-NG) images with known methane plumes to create two simulated satellite products. One simulation had a 30 m spatial resolution with similar to 200 Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) and the other had a 60 m spatial resolution with similar to 400 SNR in the SWIR; both products had a 7.5 nm spectral spacing. We applied a linear matched filter with a sparsity prior and an albedo correction to detect and quantify the methane emission in the original AVIRIS-NG images and in both satellite simulations. We also calculated an emission flux for all images. We found that all methane plumes were detectable in all satellite simulations. The flux calculations for the simulated satellite images correlated well with the calculated flux for the original AVIRIS-NG images. We also found that coarsening spatial resolution had the largest impact on the sensitivity of the results. These results suggest that methane detection and quantification of point sources will be possible with the next generation of satellite imaging spectrometers.

Assessing the Potential of Geostationary Satellites for Aerosol Remote Sensing Based on Critical Surface Albedo	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						aerosols; remote sensing; geostationary satellites; AOD; critical surface albedo; radiative transfer; Meteosat	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER CALCULATIONS; LIBRADTRAN SOFTWARE PACKAGE; OPTICAL DEPTH RETRIEVAL; JOINT RETRIEVAL; STATE VARIABLES; SOLAR-RADIATION; SOLUTION SPACE; REFLECTANCE; UNCERTAINTY; SCATTERING	Geostationary satellites are increasingly used for the detection and tracking of atmospheric aerosols and, in particular, of the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The main advantage of these spaceborne platforms in comparison with polar orbiting satellites is their capability to observe the same region of the Earth several times per day with varying geometry. This provides a wealth of information that makes aerosol remote sensing possible when combined with the multi-spectral capabilities of the on-board imagers. Nonetheless, the suitability of geostationary observations for AOD retrieval may vary significantly depending on their spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics. In this work, the potential of geostationary satellites was assessed based on the concept of critical surface albedo (CSA). CSA is linked to the sensitivity of each spaceborne observation to the aerosol signal, as it is defined as the value of surface albedo for which a varying AOD does not alter the satellite measurement. In this study, the sensitivity to aerosols was determined by estimating the difference between the surface albedo of the observed surface and the corresponding CSA (referred to as dCSA). The values of dCSA were calculated for one year of observations from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) spacecraft, based on radiative transfer simulations and information on the satellite acquisition geometry and the properties of the observed surface and aerosols. Different spectral channels from MSG and the future Meteosat Third Generation-Imager were used to study their distinct capabilities for aerosol remote sensing. Results highlight the significant but varying potential of geostationary observations across the observed Earth disk and for different time scales (i.e., diurnal, seasonal, and yearly). For example, the capability of sensing multiples times during the day is revealed to be a notable strength. Indeed, the value of dCSA often fluctuates significantly for a given day, which makes some instants of time more suitable for aerosol retrieval than others. This study determines these instants of time as well as the seasons and the sensing wavelengths that increase the chances for aerosol remote sensing thanks to the variations of dCSA. The outcomes of this work can be used for the development and refinement of AOD retrieval algorithms through the use of the concept of CSA. Furthermore, results can be extrapolated to other present-day geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8/9 and GOES-16/17.

This study presents the first systematic analysis of 6 commonly used sea surface salinity (SSS) products from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites and the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, in terms of their consistency among one another and with in-situ data. Overall, the satellite SSS products provide a similar characterization of the time mean SSS large-scale patterns and are relatively consistent in depicting the regions with strong SSS temporal variability. When averaged over the Arctic Ocean, the SSS show an excellent consistency in describing the seasonal and interannual variations. Comparison of satellite SSS with in-situ salinity measurements along ship transects suggest that satellite SSS captures salinity gradients away from regions with significant sea-ice concentration. The root-mean square differences (RMSD) of satellite SSS with respect to in-situ measurements improves with increasing temperature, reflecting the limitation of L-band radiometric sensitivity to SSS in cold water. However, the satellite SSS biases with respect to the in-situ measurements do not show a consistent dependence on temperature. The results have significant implications for the calibration and validation of satellite SSS as well as for the modeling community and the design of future satellite missions.

The OCO-2 and OCO-3 instruments use nearly 500,000 pixels to record high resolution spectra in three infrared wavelength ranges. These spectra are analyzed to retrieve estimates of the column-average carbon dioxide (XCO2) concentration in Earth's atmosphere. To meet mission requirements, these XCO2 estimates must have accuracies exceeding 0.25%, and small uncertainties in the bias or gain of even one detector pixel can add significant error to the retrieved XCO2 estimates. Thus, anomalous pixels are identified and removed from the data stream by applying a bad pixel map prior to further processing. To develop these maps, we first characterize each pixel's behavior through a collection of interpretable and statistically well-defined metrics. These features and a prior map are then used as inputs in a Random Forest classifier to assign a likelihood that a given pixel is bad. Consequently, the likelihoods are analyzed and thresholds are chosen to produce a new bad pixel map. The machine learning approach adopted here has improved data quality by identifying hundreds of new bad pixels in each detector. Such an approach can be generalized to other instruments that require independent calibration of many individual elements.

The Cassini observations include three seasons of Titan, which provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine the seasonal variations of Titan's emitted power. Our analyses show that Titan's emitted power displays different seasonal behaviors between the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The global-average emitted power decreased by 6.8 +/- 0.4% during the Cassini period (2004-2017). Such a temporal variation represents the magnitude of the seasonal cycle of Titan's emitted power, which is at least one order of magnitude stronger than the seasonal variation of Earth's emitted power (<0.5%). More importantly, the similar to 6.8% decrease of the emitted power is much smaller than the similar to 18.6% decrease of the solar flux from the change of Sun-Titan distance, implying a significantly dynamical energy budget on Titan.

Mars rover operations rely on vision-based systems to avoid hazards as well as plan safe routes. However, vision-based systems operate on the assumption that sufficient visual texture is visible in the scene. This poses a challenge for vision-based navigation on Mars where regions lacking visual texture are prevalent. To overcome this, we make use of the ability of the rover to actively steer the visual sensor to improve fault tolerance and maximize the perception performance. This paper answers the question of where and when to look by presenting a method for predicting the sensor trajectory that maximizes the localization performance of the rover. This is accomplished by an online assessment of possible trajectories using synthetic, future camera views created from previous observations of the scene. The proposed trajectories are quantified and chosen based on the expected localization performance. In this study, we validate the proposed method in field experiments at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Mars Yard. Furthermore, multiple performance metrics are identified and evaluated for reducing the overall runtime of the algorithm. We show how actively steering the perception system increases the localization accuracy compared with traditional fixed-sensor configurations.

Wavelet isolation of meridionally moving geopotential height perturbations near the subtropics of eastern Africa and their relationship with the Madden-Julian Oscillation	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						intraseasonal variability; Madden-Julian Oscillation; meridional propagation; tropical-extratropical interactions; wavelet	COUPLED EQUATORIAL WAVES; MJO INITIATION; EXTRATROPICAL INFLUENCE; MEAN STATE; CIRCULATION; CONVECTION; TRANSFORM	Prior to the onset of convection over the western Indian Ocean for many Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) events, equatorward-propagating upper tropospheric negative geopotential height anomalies are observed along the east coast of Africa. To identify these signals independently from the MJO, we calculate partial meridional-temporal wavelet transforms averaged between 35 and 45 degrees E and centred in the subtropics. During times when the amplitudes of MJO indices are strong and leading up to convective onset over the western Indian Ocean, increased wavelet power relative to the mean state is observed in the equatorward direction at intraseasonal time-scales from both hemispheres. Regressions against groups of equatorward intraseasonal wavelet transform time series centred on negative anomalies in the subtropics show extratropical Rossby wave trains extending to the west across the Atlantic similar to signals previously observed leading up to the onset of Indian basin convection in composite MJO events. Compared to globally averaged mean-state power spectra in the subtropics, increased equatorward propagation of upper tropospheric geopotential height anomalies occurs regionally near eastern Africa on intraseasonal time-scales, which suggests that local mean-state conditions, in addition to the MJO, may influence meridional wave propagation. Since these anomalies may in turn influence the onset of MJO convection over the western Indian Ocean and have higher local power, mean-state conditions near the subtropics of eastern Africa may change the timing of the MJO.

Photovoltaic operation in the lower atmosphere and at the surface of Venus	PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						high-temperature photovoltaics; multi-junction solar cells; Venus exploration missions	TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE	Low-intensity high-temperature (LIHT) solar cells are needed for extended photovoltaic power generation in both the lower atmosphere as well as at the surface of Venus. Double-junction GaInP/GaAs solar cells that may be able to operate and survive, with suitable encapsulation, for several weeks on the 465 degrees C Venus surface have been developed. These solar cells have been optimized for operation under the Venus solar spectrum, which is different from that of the Earth.

On the use of NLSST and MCSST for the study of spatio-temporal trends in SST gradients	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; FRONTS; ALGORITHMS; BRAZIL	Ongoing efforts are dedicated by meteorological and oceanographic agencies to improve the accuracy of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) estimates from satellite observations via improved retrieval algorithms and validation data. An important application of satellite-based SST observations is the analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of ocean fronts, which depend on several parameters including the SST retrieval scheme from Top-of-Atmosphere Brightness Temperatures. In this study, we focus on two widely used SST retrieval algorithms, namely the Multichannel SST (MCSST) and the Nonlinear SST (NLSST). Using night-time Level 2 SST derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Aqua from 2005 to 2015 over the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SAO), we show that 1) the spatial distribution and temporal variability of SST gradient magnitudes derived from these two SST retrieval schemes are different despite statistical consistency of SST fields 2) the widely used NLSST formulation introduces a correlation between SST gradient magnitudes and SST values. This correlation, likely due to the use of a first guess SST in the NLSST formulation, is not observed in the MCSST data and may affect the study of long-term changes in ocean dynamics.

High optical quality factors lead to the low noise of the signals. Small size of the optical components results in small form factor of the photonic devices. As such, the photonic oscillators outperform the majority of high frequency microwave ones of purely electronic nature.

CosmoDC2 is the starting point for the second data challenge (DC2) carried out by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)(3) box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440 deg(2) of sky area to a redshift of z = 3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband filter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efficient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSST DESC DC2 analyses. This paper also represents the official release of the cosmoDC2 data set, including an efficient reader that facilitates interaction with the data.

Quantification of Ammonia Emissions With High Spatial Resolution Thermal Infrared Observations From the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) Airborne Instrument	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Ammonia; hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES); smoldering fires	ATMOSPHERIC AMMONIA; PARTICULATE MATTER; RETRIEVAL METHOD; NH3; VARIABILITY; PLUMES; VALIDATION; DEPOSITION; CALIFORNIA; POLLUTION	Thermal infrared spectra can provide unique information on atmospheric ammonia enhancements, including those produced by agricultural, industrial, and biomass burning sources. In this work, we develop and test a quantitative ammonia retrieval algorithm using data from the airborne hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES) instrument over diverse targets, including persistent ammonia sources, such as cattle feedlots and a power plant, as well as a small, smoldering wildfire. Although no formal validation was possible due to lack of collocated observations, the HyTES ammonia values over feedlots in the California San Joaquin Valley are shown to be consistent within the estimated retrieval uncertainty of 20%-50% with in situ ammonia values collected over the same facilities during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. HyTES also observed meter-scale thermal hot spots associated with a small wildfire in Northern Arizona, which was determined to coincide with the emission of free ammonia, presumed to originate from the fire. This very localized emission source, not visible from satellite sensors, could be resolved in HyTES imagery. The ammonia enhancement immediately downwind from the smoldering fire, before the free ammonia reacted to form aerosols, was found to be distinguishable from the background with values three to ten times smaller than ammonia enhancements from the power plant and cattle feedlots, respectively. High-resolution detection and quantification of ammonia over nonpersistent sources like wildfires from HyTES shows that it is a powerful tool that can be used to improve regional scale fire emission inventories by accounting for the presence of temporally short ammonia processes.

Here, we use ID to illustrate the information gained by fusing spectroscopic data acquired over different wavelength ranges. For Cuprite, a mineral-rich site in the Nevada desert, the signal content from visible to short-wave infrared (VSWIR) describes almost entirely different signal content from the thermal infrared (TIR). Due to the extremely limited number of coincident VSWIR and TIR acquisitions previously acquired, this article provides a unique opportunity to quantify the information content gained by adding TIR acquisitions to the more commonly acquired VSWIR data. We highlight the importance of combined VSWIR/TIR imaging for the complete characterization and mapping of mineral and other sites.

Development of new analytical instruments and accompanying methodologies are needed, especially those that are compatible with unknown and diverse samples potentially found on solar system targets and that avoid complexities involved with other wet chemistry techniques (desalting, derivatization and contamination issues, etc.). In this study, we demonstrate that online supercritical fluid extraction and supercritical fluid chromatography with water-saturated CO2 can extract and separate nonpolar analytes of astrobiological interest, such as free fatty acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic compounds containing nitrogen or sulfur. Silica was used as a support material to immobilize aqueous samples during extraction. A C18 stationary phase with an embedded polar functional group and efficient end-capping in combination with water in the mobile phase allowed efficient separation of both free fatty acids and basic compounds. The total analysis time was 30 min, including extraction, equilibration, and separation. Detection was performed with a UV detector and a quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with electrospray ionization. The method was validated in terms of lower detection limits (0.02-40 mu g/L), precision (repeatability 3-13%), relative standard deviation (RSD), intermediate precision 4-26% (RSD), trueness (bias ranging from -48 to 9%), and retention time shifts (< 2% RSD) for 16 analytes in sample matrices with sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate that may be present in ocean worlds such as Europa or Enceladus.

The OVROLWA is a dipole array that images the entire viewable hemisphere with 58 MHz of bandwidth from 27 to 84 MHz at 13 s cadence. No transients are detected above a 6.5s flux density limit of 10.5 Jy, implying an upper limit to the transient surface density of 2.5 x 10(-8) deg(-2) at the shortest timescales probed, which is orders of magnitude deeper than has been achieved at sub-100 MHz frequencies and comparable flux densities to date. The nondetection of transients in the OVRO-LWA survey, particularly at minutes-long timescales, allows us to place further constraints on the rate of the potential population of transients uncovered by Stewart et al. From their transient rate, we expect a detection of 8.4(-8.0)(+31.8) events, and the probability of our null detection is 1.9(-1.9)(+644) x 10(-3) ruling out a transient rate >1.4.x.10-4 days-1 deg-2 with 95% confidence at a flux density limit of 18.1 Jy, under the assumption of a flat spectrum and wide bandwidth. We discuss the implications of our nondetection for this population and further constraints that can be made on the source spectral index, intrinsic emission bandwidth, and resulting luminosity distribution.

J	Hu, RY; Diaz, HD				Hu, Renyu; Diaz, Hector Delgado			Stability of Nitrogen in Planetary Atmospheres in Contact with Liquid Water	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ABIOTIC FIXATION; OXYGEN; OXIDE; BIOSIGNATURES; CHEMISTRY; NITROXYL; NITRITE	Molecular nitrogen is the most commonly assumed background gas that supports habitability on rocky planets. Despite its chemical inertness, nitrogen molecules are broken by lightning, hot volcanic vents, and bolide impacts, and can be converted into soluble nitrogen compounds and then sequestered in the ocean. The very stability of nitrogen, and that of nitrogen-based habitability, is thus called into question. Here we determine the lifetime of molecular nitrogen vis-a-vis aqueous sequestration, by developing a novel model that couples atmospheric photochemistry and oceanic chemistry. We find that HNO, the dominant nitrogen compound produced in anoxic atmospheres, is converted to N2O in the ocean, rather than oxidized to nitrites or nitrates as previously assumed. This N2O is then released back into the atmosphere and quickly converted to N-2. We also find that the deposition rate of NO is severely limited by the kinetics of the aqueous-phase reaction that converts NO to nitrites in the ocean. Putting these insights together, we conclude that the atmosphere must produce nitrogen species at least as oxidized as NO2 and HNO2 to enable aqueous sequestration. The lifetime of molecular nitrogen in anoxic atmospheres is determined to be >1 billion years on temperate planets of both Sun-like and M dwarf stars. This result upholds the validity of molecular nitrogen as a universal background gas on rocky planets.

Estimates of Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measures from Cosmological Simulations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						intergalactic medium; methods: statistical; pulsars: general		We calculate the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium (IGM) to the total measured DM for fast radio bursts (FRBs). We use the MareNostrum Instituto de Ciencias del Espacio (MICE) Onion Universe simulation to track the evolution of the dark matter particle density over a large range of redshifts. We convert this dark matter particle number density to the corresponding free electron density and then integrate it to find the DM as a function of redshift. This approach yields an intergalactic DM of DMIGM 1707000 pc cm(-3), with the large errors representative of the structure in the IGM. We place limits on the redshifts of the current population of observed FRBs. We also use our results to estimate the host galaxy contribution to the DM for the first repeater, FRB 121102, and show that the most probable host galaxy DM contribution, DMhost >> 310 pc cm(-3), is consistent with the estimate made using the Balmer emission lines in the spectrum of the host galaxy, DMBalmer = 324 pc cm(-3). We also compare our predictions for the host galaxy contribution to the DM for the observations of FRB 180924 and FRB 190523, both of which have been localized to a host galaxy.	[Pol, N.; Lam, M.

Analysis of the Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Content in 2003-2018	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							GREAT SALINITY ANOMALIES; WESTERN ARCTIC-OCEAN; SEA-ICE DECLINE; GEOSTROPHIC CURRENTS; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION; MODEL; TRANSPORT; PATHWAYS; MECHANISMS	Hydrographic data collected from research cruises, bottom-anchored moorings, drifting Ice-Tethered Profilers, and satellite altimetry in the Beaufort Gyre region of the Arctic Ocean document an increase of more than 6,400 km(3) of liquid freshwater content from 2003 to 2018: a 40% growth relative to the climatology of the 1970s. This fresh water accumulation is shown to result from persistent anticyclonic atmospheric wind forcing (1997-2018) accompanied by sea ice melt, a wind-forced redirection of Mackenzie River discharge from predominantly eastward to westward flow, and a contribution of low salinity waters of Pacific Ocean origin via Bering Strait. Despite significant uncertainties in the different observations, this study has demonstrated the synergistic value of having multiple diverse datasets to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of Beaufort Gyre freshwater content variability. For example, Beaufort Gyre Observational System (BGOS) surveys clearly show the interannual increase in freshwater content, but without satellite or Ice-Tethered Profiler measurements, it is not possible to resolve the seasonal cycle of freshwater content, which in fact is larger than the year-to-year variability, or the more subtle interannual variations. Plain Language Abstract The Beaufort Gyre centered in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean is the major reservoir of fresh water in the Arctic. The primary focus of this study is on quantifying variability and trends in liquid (water) and solid (sea ice) freshwater content in this region. The Beaufort Gyre Exploration Program was initiated in 2003 to synthesize results of historical data analysis, design and conduct long-term observations, and to provide information for numerical modeling under the umbrella of the FAMOS (Forum for Arctic Observing and Modeling Synthesis) project. The data collected from research cruises, moorings, Ice-Tethered Profiler observations, and satellite altimetry document an increase of more than 6,400 km(3) of liquid freshwater content from 2003 to 2018, a 40% growth relative to the climatology of the 1970s. This fresh water volume is comparable to the fresh water volume released to the sub-arctic seas during the Great Salinity Anomaly episode of the 1970s. Thus, since the 2000s, the stage has been set for another possible release of fresh water to lower latitudes with accompanying climate impacts, including changes to sea ice conditions, ocean circulation, and ecosystems of the Sub-Arctic similar to the influence of the Great Salinity Anomaly observed in the 1970s.

Bacterial growth in saturated and eutectic solutions of magnesium sulphate and potassium chlorate with relevance to Mars and the ocean worlds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Astrobiology; deliquescence; epsotolerance; extremophiles; habitability; halotolerance; Mars; planetary protection; psychrotolerant; salinotolerance	GREAT SALT PLAINS; SALINE LAKES; PERCHLORATE; WATER; LIFE; SASKATCHEWAN; TOLERANCE; METHANE	Liquid water on Mars might be created by deliquescence of hygroscopic salts or by permafrost melts, both potentially forming saturated brines. Freezing point depression allows these heavy brines to remain liquid in the near-surface environment for extended periods, perhaps as eutectic solutions, at the lowest temperatures and highest salt concentrations where ices and precipitates do not form. Perchlorate and chlorate salts and iron sulphate form brines with low eutectic temperatures and may persist under Mars near-surface conditions, but are chemically harsh at high concentrations and were expected to be incompatible with life, while brines of common sulphate salts on Mars may be more suitable for microbial growth. Microbial growth in saturated brines also may be relevant beyond Mars, to the oceans of Ceres, Enceladus, Europa and Pluto. We have previously shown strong growth of salinotolerant bacteria in media containing 2M MgSO4 heptahydrate (similar to 50% w/v) at 25 degrees C. Here we extend those observations to bacterial isolates from Basque Lake, BC and Hot Lake, WA, that grow well in saturated MgSO4 medium (67%) at 25 degrees C and in 50% MgSO4 medium at 4 degrees C (56% would be saturated). Psychrotolerant, salinotolerant microbes isolated from Basque Lake soils included Halomonas and Marinococcus, which were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and characterized phenetically. Eutectic liquid medium constituted by 43% MgSO4 at -4 degrees C supported copious growth of these psychrotolerant Halomonas isolates, among others. Bacterial isolates also grew well at the eutectic for K chlorate (3% at -3 degrees C). Survival and growth in eutectic solutions increases the possibility that microbes contaminating spacecraft pose a contamination risk to Mars. The cold brines of sulphate and (per)chlorate salts that may form at times on Mars through deliquescence or permafrost melt have now been demonstrated to be suitable microbial habitats, should appropriate nutrients be available and dormant cells become vegetative.

The Subsurface Coherent Rock Content of the Moon as Revealed by Cold-Spot Craters	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							IMPACT CRATERS; MARE BASALTS; LUNAR MARIA; REGOLITH; SURFACE; RADAR; CONSTRAINTS; THICKNESS; BOULDERS; GRAVITY	A recently identified class of young lunar craters, cold-spot craters, provides an optimal data set for probing the subsurface rock content on the Moon. Rocks, or lack of rocks, in crater ejecta have long been used as indicators of regolith thickness. However, the rockiness of crater ejecta depends on the subsurface rock content, crater excavation depth, and crater age. Cold-spot craters are surrounded by a low thermal inertia signature that fades within 1 Myr, so any rocks in the proximal ejecta blanket have not yet been broken down or buried. Thus, the rock abundance in the proximal ejecta blankets of cold-spot craters is affected only by the subsurface rock content of the target and the crater excavation depth, not the age of the crater. We show that an abrupt transition between fine-grained regolith and underlying coherent rock cannot explain the observed rock abundance. Instead, we assume that the volume fraction of coherent rock (in contrast to fine-grained regolith) increases exponentially in the lunar subsurface and use the observed Diviner rock abundance in cold-spot crater ejecta to solve for the "e-folding" depth over which the volume fraction of rock increases. In general, the subsurface rock content is higher in the maria than in the highlands consistent with more recent resurfacing of the maria. However, the highlands show a wider range of subsurface rock content values overall including some overlapping those of the maria. Some of this variability appears to be associated with the Orientale basin and possibly with several cryptomare deposits.	[Elder, C.

AirSWOT was designed as a calibration and validation instrument for the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, an international spaceborne synthetic aperture radar mission planned for launch in 2022 which will enable global mapping of WSE and WSS. As an airborne instrument, capable of quickly repeating overflights, AirSWOT enables measurement of high frequency and fine scale hydrological processes encountered in coastal regions. In this paper, we use data collected by AirSWOT in the Mississippi River Delta and surrounding wetlands of coastal Louisiana, USA, to investigate the capabilities of Ka-band interferometry for mapping WSE and WSS in coastal marsh environments. We introduce a data-driven method to estimate the time-varying interferometric phase drift resulting from radar hardware response to environmental conditions. A system of linear equations based on AirSWOT measurements is solved for elevation bias and time-varying phase calibration parameters using weighted least squares. We observed AirSWOT WSE uncertainty of 12 cm RMS compared to in situ water level measurements when averaged over an area of 0.5 km(2) at incidence angles below 15 degrees. At higher incidence angles, the observed AirSWOT elevation bias is possibly due to residual phase calibration errors or radar backscatter from vegetation. Elevation profiles along the Wax Lake Outlet river channel indicate AirSWOT can measure WSS over a 24 km distance with uncertainty below 0.3 cm/km, 8% of the true water surface slope as measured by in situ data. The data analysis and results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential of AirSWOT to measure water surface elevation and slope within highly dynamic and spatially complex coastal environments.

J	Nguyen, H; Cressie, N; Hobbs, J				Hai Nguyen; Cressie, Noel; Hobbs, Jonathan			Sensitivity of Optimal Estimation Satellite Retrievals to Misspecification of the Prior Mean and Covariance, with Application to OCO-2 Retrievals	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						bias; efficiency; inverse problem; satellite retrievals; uncertainty quantification; validity	TROPOSPHERIC EMISSION SPECTROMETER; ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; ERROR; QUANTIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; INVERSIONS; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; DIOXIDE	Optimal Estimation (OE) is a popular algorithm for remote sensing retrievals, partly due to its explicit parameterization of the sources of error and the ability to propagate them into estimates of retrieval uncertainty. These properties require specification of the prior distribution of the state vector. In many remote sensing applications, the true priors are multivariate and hard to characterize properly. Instead, priors are often constructed based on subject-matter expertise, existing empirical knowledge, and a need for computational expediency, resulting in a "working prior." This paper explores the retrieval bias and the inaccuracy in retrieval uncertainty caused by explicitly separating the true prior (the probability distribution of the underlying state) from the working prior (the probability distribution used within the OE algorithm), with an application to Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) retrievals. We find that, in general, misspecifying the mean in the working prior will lead to biased retrievals, and misspecifying the covariance in the working prior will lead to inaccurate estimates of the retrieval uncertainty, though their effects vary depending on the state-space signal-to-noise ratio of the observing instrument. Our results point towards some attractive properties of a class of uninformative priors that is implicit for least-squares retrievals. Furthermore, our derivations provide a theoretical basis, and an understanding of the trade-offs involved, for the practice of inflating a working-prior covariance in order to reduce the prior's impact on a retrieval (e.g., for OCO-2 retrievals). Finally, our results also lead to practical recommendations for specifying the prior mean and the prior covariance in OE.

We also discuss the effects of antenna beam width to mitigate inter-satellite interferences, as well as how the local oscillator stability affects the obtained Doppler estimates. The required signal processing resources are less stringent for the iRO than for conventional RO techniques. In addition, the zenith iRO has a comparable performance to the well-established RO techniques.

It operates in five pairs of 1 GHz bands from 17 to 27 GHz simultaneously. The receiver temperature measured at the feed is 21-22 K at 22 GHz and, during dry winter night-time conditions, zenith system temperatures as low as 35K have been observed in the 21-22 GHz band. The native polarization is linear but can be converted to circular prior to down-conversion. The downconverters have complex mixers, followed by quadrature hybrids which can be bypassed or used to convert the quadrature phase channels into an upper and lower sideband, each 1000 MHz wide. For spectroscopy, four ROACH1 signal processors each currently providing 32 K channel spectra across four 1000 MHz bands, for 0.4 km/s velocity resolution at 22 GHz. Using both beam- and position-switching, the receiver achieved a noise level of 5 mK r.m.s. in an hour of integration and 31 kHz resolution. The NASA 70 m antennas have a 45 arcsec beamwidth at 22 GHz and an aperture efficiency of 35.5% giving a sensitivity of 0.49 K/Jy.	[Kuiper, T. B. H.; Teitelbaum, L.

T.; Ye, Hengchun			Investigating Relationship Between Soil Moisture and Precipitation Globally Using Remote Sensing Observations	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION			English	Article						TRMM precipitation; SMAP soil moisture; global relationship; satellite observations	RAINFALL FEEDBACK; CLIMATE	The complex relationship between precipitation and soil moisture plays a critical role in land surface hydrology. Traditionally, the analysis of this relationship is restricted by the spatial coverage of both soil moisture and precipitation data that are collected through in-situ observations at limited locations. In this study, we utilized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s remote sensing products of soil moisture (SMAP: Soil Moisture Active Passive) and precipitation (TRMM: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), which provide near-global coverage, to investigate the co-variation of precipitation and soil moisture regionally, as a function of ecosystem types and climate regimes. We apply information on land cover and climate regimes to provide insight about correlation strength of soil moisture and precipitation. The results indicate that most of the globe has a moderate to strong positive correlation of SMAP soil moisture and TRMM precipitation data during the study period. In relation to land cover, soil moisture and precipitation have the strongest correlations in regions of limited vegetation, whereas forests and densely vegetated regions have weaker correlations. As for climate regimes, they have the strongest correlations in arid or cold regions, and weaker correlations in humid, temperate locations. While remotely sensed soil moisture data are less reliable in dense vegetation, these results confirm that drier, less vegetated climates show a highly linear relationship between soil moisture and rainfall.

Compensating Changes in the Penetration Depth of Pulse-Limited Radar Altimetry Over the Greenland Ice Sheet	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Ice; Sea surface; Surface topography; Spaceborne radar; Scattering; Surface waves; CryoSat-2; Greenland; ice sheets; radar altimetry	ELEVATION CHANGE; RETRACKING ALGORITHM; SURFACE-PROPERTIES; IMPULSE-RESPONSE; CRYOSAT-2 DATA; ROUGH-SURFACE; VOLUME-CHANGE; SCATTERING; MODEL; FLUCTUATIONS	Changes in firn properties affect the shape of pulse-limited radar altimeter echoes acquired over the polar ice sheets. We apply a waveform deconvolution model to CryoSat-2 low-resolution mode echoes to determine the depth distribution of radar backscattering across the Greenland Ice Sheet. The deconvolution allows us to calculate the relative contributions of surface and volume scattering and the effective penetration depth of the radar echoes into the snowpack. The most prominent signal is associated with the extreme surface melting of summer 2012, which resulted in a shift of the dominant radar scattering horizon toward the snow surface in the accumulation zone. At locations above 2000 m, the average penetration depth in July 2012 (prior to the melt event) was 3.79 1.12 m. Following the melt event, there was an abrupt reduction in the average penetration depth across the same region to 1.45 0.94 m. The average penetration depth then gradually increased to 3.28 1.13 m by the end of 2017, as fresh snow accumulated on the ice sheet surface. Although the variation in penetration is evident in surface height estimates derived from the CryoSat-2 echoes, the magnitude of the effect is reduced by waveform retracking. Using airborne laser altimeter data recorded over the same time period, we show that the penetration variation can be compensated effectively by incorporating the deconvolution penetration depth into the surface height retrieval.

Aerial Seismology Using Balloon-Based Barometers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Venus; Terrestrial atmosphere; Laboratories; Seismology; Earth; Acoustics; Geology; Balloons; infrasound; remote sensing; seismology; titan; venus	INFRASOUND; INVERSION; WAVES; VENUS; TOPOGRAPHY; PRESSURE; VOLCANO	Seismology on Venus has long eluded planetary scientists due to extreme temperature and pressure conditions on its surface, which most electronics cannot withstand for mission durations required for ground-based seismic studies. We show that infrasonic (low-frequency) pressure fluctuations, generated as a result of ground motion, produced by an artificial seismic source known as a seismic hammer, and recorded using sensitive microbarometers deployed on a tethered balloon, are able to replicate the frequency content of ground motion. We also show that weak, artificial seismic activity thus produced may be geolocated by using multiple airborne barometers. The success of this technique paves the way for balloon-based aero-seismology, leading to a potentially revolutionary method to perform seismic studies from a remote airborne station on the earth and solar system objects with substantial atmospheres such as Venus and Titan.

The 25-km resolution requirement of the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission limits wind speed retrievals to using only a small fraction of the delay-Doppler map (DDM) near the specular point. This paper presents a new method to invert a larger portion of the DDM and estimate the wind field within a swath defined by the maximum delay. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is applied to combine a series of DDMs and estimates the wind speed on a uniformly gridded ocean surface exploiting the large overlap between sequential looks. Wind retrievals at the specular point using simulated data generated using wind fields from two hurricanes (Danielle and Earl, 2010) were found to meet the CYGNSS measurement requirements (2 m/s for U 20 m/s and 10 for U 20 m/s) and perform better than a typical single-point observable. Wind retrievals were also found to meet these requirements below 20 m/s within a 90-km swath and meet them for hurricane-force winds (30 m/s) within a 22-km swath. Similar results were obtained using a compressed ($17 \times 11$ ) DDM, demonstrating benefits of sequential processing within a limited data budget. Delay-Doppler ambiguities introduced noticeable artifacts in circumstances where the wind varies asymmetrically within the observed ($90\times 90$ km) surface area but did not appear to affect specular point wind retrievals.

Comparison of Radiation Effects in Custom and Commercially Fabricated Resistive Memory Devices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						Gamma-ray effects; ion radiation effects; resistive memory (RRAM) devices; semiconductor device testing; tantalum oxide; thin-film devices	DISPLACEMENT DAMAGE; IONIZING-RADIATION; TAOX; HARDNESS; IRRADIATION; RAY	The radiation response of TaOx-based resistive memory (RRAM) devices fabricated in academic (Set A) and industrial (Set B) settings was compared. Ionization damage from a Co-60 gamma source did not cause any changes in device resistance for either device type, up to 45 Mrad(Si). Displacement damage from a heavy ion beam caused a decrease in resistance at oxygen displacements per cm(3) in Set B devices in the high-resistance state (HRS); meanwhile, Set A devices did not exhibit any decrease in resistance due to displacement damage. Both types of devices exhibited an increase in resistance around oxygen displacements per cm(3), possibly due to the damage at the oxide/metal interfaces. These extremely high levels of damage represent near-total atomic disruption, and if this level of damage was ever reached, other circuit elements would likely fail before the RRAM devices in this article. Overall, both sets of devices were much more resistant to radiation effects than the similar devices reported in the literature. Displacement damage effects were only observed in the Set A devices once the displacement-induced oxygen vacancies surpassed the intrinsic vacancy concentration in the devices, suggesting that high oxygen vacancy concentration played a role in the devices' high tolerance to displacement damage.

Our sample consists of 78 spectroscopically normal SNe Ia, with the remainder divided between distinct subclasses (3 SN 1991bg-like, 3 SN 1991T-like, 4 SNe Iax, 2 peculiar, and 3 super-Chandrasekhar events), and has a median redshift of 0.0192. The SNe in our sample have a median coverage of 16 photometric epochs at a cadence of 5.4 d, and the median first observed epoch is similar to 4.6 d before maximum B-band light. We describe how the SNe in our sample are discovered, observed, and processed, and we compare the results from our newly developed automated photometry pipeline to those from the previous processing pipeline used by LOSS. After investigating potential biases, we derive a final systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in BVRI for our data set. We perform an analysis of our light curves with particular focus on using template fitting tomeasure the parameters that are useful in standardizing SNe Ia as distance indicators. All of the data are available to the community, and we encourage future studies to incorporate our light curves in their analyses.

The relationship between Centaurs and Jupiter Family Comets with implications for K-Pg-type impacts	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						celestial mechanics; comets: general; minor planets; asteroids: general	OUTER SOLAR-SYSTEM; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; ORBITAL EVOLUTION; FRIEND; DELIVERY; DISK	Centaurs - icy bodies orbiting beyond Jupiter and interior to Neptune - are believed to be dynamically related to Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs), which have aphelia near Jupiter's orbit and perihelia in the inner Solar system. Previous dynamical simulations have recreated the Centaur/JFC conversion, but the mechanism behind that process remains poorly described. We have performed a numerical simulation of Centaur analogues that recreates this process, generating a data set detailing over 2.6 million close planet/planetesimal interactions. We explore scenarios stored within that data base and, from those, describe the mechanism by which Centaur objects are converted into JFCs. Because many JFCs have perihelia in the terrestrial planet region, and since Centaurs are constantly resupplied from the Scattered Disc, the JFCs are an ever-present impact threat.	[Grazier, K.

The International Pulsar Timing Array: second data release	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: neutron; pulsars: general; gravitational waves; methods: data analysis	CONTINUOUS GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; RELATIVISTIC CELESTIAL MECHANICS; BINARY MILLISECOND PULSAR; RECYCLED PULSARS; SINGLE SOURCES; SOLAR-SYSTEM; DISCOVERY; PRECISION; RADIO; TIME	In this paper, we describe the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release, which includes recent pulsar timing data obtained by three regional consortia: the European Pulsar Timing Array, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, and the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. We analyse and where possible combine high-precision timing data for 65 millisecond pulsars which are regularly observed by these groups. A basic noise analysis, including the processes which are both correlated and uncorrelated in time, provides noise models and timing ephemerides for the pulsars. We find that the timing precisions of pulsars are generally improved compared to the previous data release, mainly due to the addition of new data in the combination. The main purpose of this work is to create the most up-to-date IPTA data release. These data are publicly available for searches for low-frequency gravitational waves and other pulsar science.

We investigate the nature and structure of this bias by tracking how objects from a heterogeneous training sample contribute to photo-z predictions as a function of magnitude and colour, and illustrate that the underlying redshift distribution at fixed colour can evolve strongly as a function of magnitude. We then test the robustness of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal in 120 deg(2) of HSC-SSP DR1 data to spectroscopic completeness and photo-z biases, and find that their impacts are sub-dominant to current statistical uncertainties. Our methodology provides a framework to investigate how spectroscopic incompleteness can impact photo-z-based weak lensing predictions in future surveys such as LSST and WFIRST.

Fractional polarization of extragalactic sources in the 500 deg(2) SPTpol survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						polarization; galaxies: active; cosmology: observations	RADIO-SOURCES; LINEAR-POLARIZATION; COMPLETE SAMPLE; HIGH-FREQUENCY; STATISTICS	We study the polarization properties of extragalactic sources at 95 and 150 GHz in the SPTpol 500 deg(2) survey. We estimate the polarized power by stacking maps at known source positions, and correct for noise bias by subtracting the mean polarized power at random positions in the maps. We show that the method is unbiased using a set of simulated maps with similar noise properties to the real SPTpol maps. We find a flux-weighted mean-squared polarization fraction < p(2)> = [8.9 +/- 1.1] x 10(-4) at 95 GHz and [6.9 +/- 1.1] x 10(-4) at 150 GHz for the full sample. This is consistent with the values obtained for a subsample of active galactic nuclei. For dusty sources, we find 95 per cent upper limits of < p(2)> 95 < 16.9 x 10(-3) and < p(2)> 150 < 2.6 x 10(-3). We find no evidence that the polarization fraction depends on the source flux or observing frequency. The 1 sigma upper limit on measured mean-squared polarization fraction at 150 GHz implies that extragalactic foregrounds will be subdominant to the CMB E and B mode polarization power spectra out to at least l less than or similar to 5700 (l less than or similar to 4700) and l less than or similar to 5300 (l less than or similar to 3600), respectively, at 95 (150) GHz.

Some of these organics may be deposited in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes in the polar regions and form evaporite features when the lakes dry out as part of Titan's methane/ethane cycle that is analogous to Earth's hydrologic cycle. Modeling suggests that acetylene and butane would be the main components of such evaporite deposits. We have previously demonstrated that some organic molecules (such as benzene and ethane) readily form co-crystals in Titan-relevant conditions. We report here Raman spectroscopic evidence for a new co-crystal between acetylene and butane, which could be the most common organic co-crystal discovered so far of direct relevance to Titan's surface. Intermolecular interactions such as those in the acetylene-butane co-crystal could modify the kinetics and equilibria of various processes (dissolution, reprecipitation, etc.) and therefore may play a key role in the formation mechanisms and timescales of landscape evolution on Titan.

Several spatial interpolation methods, including Arithmetic Mean, Thiessen Polygon, Inverse Distance Weighting, Ordinary Kriging and Spline were applied on the ground observations to transform the point-based precipitation into areal precipitation. Slight variations in the interpolated values were found, but overall it was comparable. Based on the daily rainfall data for the duration of 62 days, this study found that all SPPs performed with acceptable accuracy, as shown by the Kelantan river basin; however, these SPPs did not estimate accurately for Langat and Johor river basins. Overall, TRMM and CMORPH outperformed PERSIANN for the Langat and Johor river basins. In conclusion, all SPPs were capable of predicting heavy rainfall during the northeast monsoon and the level of accuracy is promising for the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. However, as for the rest of the region, careful consideration should be given when applying the SPPs.

APXS spectrum simulations facilitated the characterization of trace elements measured by the APXS under experimental situations commonly encountered on Mars. The precise quantification limits (PQL) obtained under ideal conditions are consistent with limits of detection in the literature and increase with degrading spectral quality. Major trace element species, such nickel, zinc, and bromine, with typical concentrations in the 100s of mu g/g (or less), are quantifiable even with short (e.g., 20 min) early morning measurements between drives given the typical concentrations at the MSL site, Gale Crater. Target compositions currently in the public domain with major trace element species below the derived PQL specific to each measurement are noted. Quantification of copper, gallium, and germanium at 30 ppm and < 10% uncertainty can be achieved with measurement durations of 6 h, 3 h, and 4 h respectively. In areas of local enrichment, such as the Murray formation, germanium abundance can be assessed with < 10% uncertainty in 30 min. The detection and quantification of cobalt is hindered by the presence of overlapping peaks associated with the ubiquitous iron and nickel present in Mars samples. Only a single sample interrogated by Curiositys APXS up to sot 2003 contains cobalt at detectable levels, coinciding with a composition similar to terrestrial ferromanganese crusts and nodules formed under inorganic aqueous conditions. The work presented herein emphasizes the need for acquiring quality APXS measurements where reliable trace element quantification is desired and offers guidance to improve the tactical operation of the MSL APXS instrument.

This study examines the contributions of thermogenic emissions from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field (PBOF) to the elevated concentrations of atmospheric CH4 observed across the NSRA. We report high precision atmospheric measurements of CH4 and ethane (C2H6) within and downwind of the PBOF. Biogenic CH4 emissions, due to methanogenic processes within the Arctic tundra, are not co-emitted with C2H6. We show that the thermogenic gas emanating from oil and gas extraction point sources contains on average 1 mol of C2H6 for every 16 mol of CH4. We use a mass balance approach to estimate total emissions of thermogenic CH4 from two days in the summer of 2016 and find 2-5 times greater emissions than the sum of all sources in the PBOF reported to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program in 2016. Although higher than reported, these emissions are much smaller than estimates of CH4 emissions from other oil and natural gas production areas in the US, and they make a very small contribution to total CH4 emissions from the North Slope.

In this study, we estimated the total mortality resulting from long-term PM2.5 and O-3 exposures in California in 2012 using multiple concentration response functions (CRFs) and attributed the estimated mortality to different emission groups. The point estimates of PM2.5-associated mortality in California ranged from 12,700 to 26,700, of which 53% were attributable to in-state anthropogenic emissions. Based on new epidemiological evidence, we estimated that O-3 could be associated with up to 13,700 deaths from diseases of both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in California. In addition, 75% of the ambient O-3 in California was due to distant emissions outside the western United States, leading to 92% of the O-3-associated mortality. Overall, distant emissions lead to greater mortality burdens of air pollution in California than local anthropogenic emissions.

Simple models of error spectra for planetary gravitational potentials as obtained from a variety of measurement configurations	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							GRAVITY-FIELD; MISSION; TRACKING; DESIGN	Planetary gravity fields are measured by various means. The accuracy of the recovered gravitational potential model depends, of course, on the number and accuracy of the measurements, and in non-trivial ways upon the measurement configuration and orbit geometry. We derive and present simple analytic expressions which yield estimates of the resulting error spectra, with reasonable accuracy. Actual recovery of gravity models from the relevant data requires much more rigorous analysis, but these models are expected to be helpful in early mission planning activities. We present results of an application to Vesta, used as a validation exercise, and show possible future results for Mars and Venus.

However, this type of inventory has the disadvantage of taking several years to be compiled because it relies on a statistical dataset. Top-down approaches use satellite data as a constraint and overcome this disadvantage. We have developed an immediate inversion system to estimate anthropogenic NOx emissions with NO2 column density constrained by satellite observations. The proposed method allows quick emission updates and considers model and observation errors by applying linear unbiased optimum estimations. We used this inversion system to estimate the variation of anthropogenic NOx emissions from China and India from 2005 to 2016. On the one hand, NOx emissions from China increased, reaching a peak in 2011 with 29.5 Tg yr(?1), and subsequently decreased to 25.2 Tg yr(?1) in 2016. On the other hand, NOx emissions from India showed a continuous increase from 2005 to 2016, reaching 13.9 Tg yr(?1) in 2016. These opposing trends from 2011 to 2016 were ?0.83 and +0.76 Tg yr(?1) over China and India, respectively, and correspond to strictly regulated and unregulated future scenarios. Assuming these trends continue after 2016, we expect NOx emissions from China and India will be similar in 2023, with India becoming the world?s largest NOx emissions source in 2024.

However, it is still unknown whether such planets orbiting close to M dwarf stars can retain their atmospheres, or whether high-energy irradiation from the star will strip the gaseous envelopes from these objects. We present a new method to detect an atmosphere on a synchronously rotating rocky exoplanet around a K/M dwarf, by using thermal emission during secondary eclipse to infer a high dayside albedo that could only be explained by bright clouds. Based on calculations for plausible surface conditions, we conclude that a high albedo could be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of an atmosphere for planets with substellar temperatures of T-sub = 410-1250 K. This range corresponds to equilibrium temperatures of T-eq = 300-880 K. We compare the inferred albedos of eight possible planet surface compositions to cloud albedo calculations. We determine that a layer of clouds with optical depths greater than tau = 0.5-7, would have high enough albedos to be distinguishable from a bare rock surface. This method of detecting an atmosphere on a rocky planet is complementary to existing methods for detecting atmospheres, because it provides a way to detect atmospheres with pressures below 1 bar (e.g., Mars), which are too tenuous to transport significant heat but thick enough to host high-albedo clouds.

Differentiation and magmatic history of Vesta: Constraints from HED meteorites and Dawn spacecraft data	GEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Vesta; Asteroid; HED meteorites; Dawn spacecraft; Intrusive:extrusive ratio; Eucrite:diogenite ratio	DIOGENITE PARENT BODY; OCEAN CRYSTALLIZATION; GRAVITY-FIELD; OLIVINE; EUCRITE; HOWARDITE; MODELS; MANTLE; REGOLITH; PYROXENE	Quantifying the amounts of various igneous lithologies in Vesta's crust allows the estimation of petrologic ratios that describe the asteroid's global differentiation and subsequent magmatic history. The eucrite:diogenite (Euc:Diog) ratio measures the relative proportions of mafic and ultramafic components. The intrusive:extrusive (I:E) ratio assesses the effectiveness of magma ascent and eruption. We estimate these ratios by counting numbers and masses of eucrites, cumulate eucrites, and diogenites in the world's meteorite collections, and by calculating their proportions as components of crustal polymict breccias (howardites) using chemical mixing diagrams and petrologic mapping of multiple thin sections. The latter two methods yield a Euc:Diog ratio of similar to 2:1, although meteorite numbers and masses give slightly higher ratios. Surface lithologic maps compiled from spectra of Dawn spacecraft instruments (VIR and GRaND) yield Euc:Diog ratios that bracket estimates of Euc:Diog from the meteorites. The I:E ratios from HEDs lie between 0.5-2.1:1, due to uncertainties in identifying cumulate eucrite. Gravity mapping of Vesta by the Dawn spacecraft supports the existence of diogenite plutons in the crust. Quantifying the proportion of high-density diogenitic crust in the gravity map yields I:E ratios of 0.8-1:2:1, values which are bracketed by calculations based on HEDs. The I:E ratio for Vesta is lower than for Earth and Mars, consistent with physical modeling of asteroid-size bodies. Nevertheless, it indicates a significant role for pluton emplacement during the formation of Vesta's crust. These results are inconsistent with simple differentiation models that produce the crust by crystallization of a global magma ocean, unless residual melts are extracted into crustal magma chambers.

The Nature of the Broadband X-Ray Variability in the Dwarf Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4395	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; BLACK-HOLE; XMM-NEWTON; TIME LAGS; ABSORPTION; MASS; DISCOVERY; NGC-4395; EMISSION; MODELS	We present a flux-resolved X-ray analysis of the dwarf Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 4395, based on three archival XMM-Newton and one archival NuSTAR observations. The source is known to harbor a low-mass black hole (<CDATA<i) and shows strong variability in the full X-ray range during these observations. We model the flux-resolved spectra of the source assuming three absorbing layers: neutral, mildly ionized, and highly ionized (<CDATA<i, <CDATA<i, and 3.8 x 10(22) cm(-2), respectively). The source also shows intrinsic variability by a factor of similar to 3 on short timescales, which is due to changes in the nuclear flux, assumed to be a power law (Gamma = 1.6-1.67). Our results show a positive correlation between the intrinsic flux and the absorbers' ionization parameter. The covering fraction of the neutral absorber varies during the first XMM-Newton observation, which could explain the pronounced soft X-ray variability. However, the source remains fully covered by this layer during the other two observations, largely suppressing the soft X-ray variability. This suggests an inhomogeneous and layered structure in the broad-line region. We also find a difference in the characteristic timescale of the power spectra between different energy ranges and observations. We finally show simulated spectra with XRISM, eXTP, and Athena, which will allow us to characterize the different absorbers, study their dynamics, and will help us identify their locations and sizes.

We build 36 composite outflow spectra, covering a large range of outflow and quasar parameters, by stacking broad iv, with a separation of 497 km s(-1), as well as those of other species, appear well resolved in most of our composites. This agrees with broad outflow troughs consisting of the superposition of narrow absorbers. We also report on the ubiquitous detection of the radiative-acceleration signature known as line-locking in all our composite outflow spectra, including one spectrum that was strictly built from broad absorption line (BAL) systems. This is the first line-locking detection in BAL composite spectra. Line-locking is driven by the C iv atomic doublet and is visible on the blue side of most strong absorption transitions. Similar effects from the doublets of O vi, Si iv, or N v, however, seem to not be present. Our results confirm that radiation pressure is a prevalent mechanism for accelerating outflows in quasars.

A Method for Assessing Relative Skill in Retrieving Cloud and Precipitation Properties in Next-Generation Cloud Radar and Radiometer Orbiting Observatories	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Cloud retrieval; Remote sensing; Satellite observations; Bayesian methods	PART II; MICROWAVE RADIOMETER; SHALLOW CUMULUS; SOLAR-RADIATION; LIQUID WATER; MODEL; RAIN; MICROPHYSICS; OCEAN; PARAMETERIZATION	A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is utilized to compare the skill of an A-Train-like observing system with a cloud, convection, and precipitation (CCP) observing system like that contemplated for the 2020s by the 2017 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey. The main objective is to demonstrate a framework for observational trade space studies. This initial work focuses on weakly precipitating warm shallow cumulus constructed from in situ data. Radiative computations are based on Mie theory with spherical assumptions. Simulated measurements in the CCP configuration consist of W- and Ka-band radar reflectivity and path-integrated attenuation, 31 and 94 GHz brightness temperatures (Tb), and visible and near-infrared reflectances. The collection of measurements in the CloudSat configuration is identical, but includes a single 94 GHz radar frequency, and the uncertainty in the 94 GHz microwave brightness temperature is increased to mimic the CloudSat Tb product. The experiments demonstrate that it remains a challenge to diagnose cloud properties in the presence of light rain because of the tendency of microwave remote sensing to respond to the higher moments of the hydrometeor populations. Rain properties are significantly better constrained than cloud properties, even in the optimal CCP configuration. The addition of Ka-band measurements places substantial constraints on the precipitation rain effective radius and rain rates. The Tb offers important information regarding the column-integrated condensate mass, the measurement accuracy of which appears more likely to affect the retrievals of clouds with low liquid water path. The constraints provided by reflectances are largely restricted to regions near the cloud top, particularly in the raining cases.

Ice Floe Tracker: An algorithm to automatically retrieve Lagrangian trajectories via feature matching from moderate-resolution visual imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ice floes; Sea ice tracking; Arctic; MODIS; Remote sensing	SENSOR MICROWAVE IMAGER; SEA-ICE; MOTION TRACKING; DRIFT TRACKING; SAR; MODIS; RADIOMETER; SSM/I; WATER	Satellite observations of sea ice along marginal ice zones suggest a strong coupling between sea ice transport and the underlying ocean turbulent eddy field. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 in provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean.

While interpolation/assimilation efforts exist to assemble discrete SWOT river observations into a spatially complete and temporally continuous record, the efficacy of such efforts is severely compromised by large observation gaps. In this study, we introduced spatiotemporal error correlations in runoff fields into the Inverse Streamflow Routing (ISR) model to improve the gap-filling capability for creating continuous daily discharge. This enhanced ISR model was first investigated in the Ohio River basin, which showed very significant improvements with better reproduced spatial and temporal dynamics of the runoff fields and the discharge time series. Results using 25 validation gauges showed a more concentrated Kling-Gupta Efficiency distribution, where the median was improved from 0.494 to 0.750. The enhanced ISR model was further tested over 16 representative global river basins to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The best fitted e-fold correlation length and time leading to the greatest improvements varied largely among the 16 basins. While all basins benefitted from the spatiotemporal correlations in the SWOT gap-filling, basins suffering from poorer initial guess and fewer SWOT observations, such as the Dnieper, Kolyma and Murray basins, showed larger performance gains than others. Although the experiments were idealized and did not reflect all potential errors that may be present in a real-world application, we demonstrate that the utility of SWOT river products and their value in hydrologic sciences may be boosted by expanding a local/intermittent observation platform into a far-reaching source of hydrologic information through both river hydrodynamics in channel networks and spatiotemporal coherence of runoff errors.

Ongoing resurfacing of KBO Eris by volatile transport in local, collisional, sublimation atmosphere regime	ICARUS			English	Article						Eris; Local atmosphere; Volatile transport; Thermal modeling; Albedo	DWARF PLANET ERIS; PLUTOS ATMOSPHERE; CHARON; BEHAVIOR; ALBEDO	Kuiper belt object (KBO) Eris is exceptionally bright with a greater visible geometric albedo than any other known KBO. Its infrared reflectance spectrum is dominated by methane, which should form tholins that darken the surface on timescales much shorter than the age of the Solar System. Thus one or more ongoing processes probably maintain its brightness. Eris is predicted to have a primarily nitrogen atmosphere that is in vapor pressure equilibrium with nitrogen-ice and is collisional (not ballistic). Eris's eccentric orbit is expected to result in two atmospheric regimes: (1) a period near perihelion when the atmosphere is global (analogous to the atmospheres of Mars, Triton, and Pluto) and (2) a period near aphelion when only a local atmosphere exists near the warmest region (analogous to the atmosphere of Io). A numerical model developed to simulate Eris's thermal and volatile evolution in the local atmosphere regime is presented. The model conserves energy, mass, and momentum while maintaining vapor pressure equilibrium. It is adaptable to other local, collisional, sublimation atmospheres, which in addition to Io and Eris, may occur on several volatile-bearing KBOs. The model was applied for a limiting case where Eris is fixed at aphelion and has an initial nitrogen-ice mass everywhere equal to the precipitable column of nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere during the New Horizons encounter (the resultant mass if the Pluto atmosphere collapsed uniformly onto the surface). The model results indicate that (1) transport of nitrogen in the local, collisional, sublimation atmosphere regime is significant, (2) changes of Eris's albedo or color from nitrogen transport may be observable, and (3) uniform collapse of a global, nitrogen atmosphere likely cannot explain Eris's anomalous albedo in the present epoch. Seasonal volatile transport remains a plausible hypothesis to explain Eris's anomalous albedo and geologic processes that renew Pluto's brightest surfaces, such as convection and glaciation, may also be operating on Eris.

Fluoride-ion solvation in non-aqueous electrolyte solutions	MATERIALS CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS			English	Article							ROOM-TEMPERATURE; ANION	Understanding the factors that influence ion-solvent properties for the fluoride ion in organic solvents is key to the development of useful liquid electrolytes for fluoride-ion batteries. Using both experimental and computational methods, we examined a range of chemical and electrochemical properties for a set of organic solvents in combination with dry N,N,N-trimethylneopentylammonium fluoride (Np1F) salt. Results showed that solvent electronic structure strongly influences Np1F dissolution, and the pK(a) of solvent protons provides a good guide to potential F- reactivity. We found a number of organic solvents capable of dissolving Np1F while providing chemically-stable F- in solution and characterized three of them in detail: propionitrile (PN), 2,6-difluoropyridine (2,6-DFP), and bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether (BTFE). Arrhenius analysis for Np1F/PN, Np1F/DFP, and Np1F/BTFE electrolytes suggests that DFP facilitates the highest F- ion mobility of the three neat solvents. Electrolyte mixtures of BTFE and amide co-solvents exhibit higher ionic conductivity than the neat solvents. This improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the ability of BTFE:co-solvent mixtures to partition between Np-1(+) and F- ion-aggregates, promoting better ion dissociation.

Along with the previously published molecular absorption feature in the 1.1?1.7 ?m bandpass, we detect a distinct absorption feature at 1.15 ?m and a weak feature at 0.95 ?m, indicating the presence of water and/or methane with a combined significance of 4.4?. We find that this planet?s nearly flat optical transmission spectrum and attenuated near-infrared molecular absorption features are best matched by models incorporating a high-altitude cloud layer. Atmospheric retrievals using the combined 0.35?1.7 ?m Hubble Space Telescope (HST) transmission spectrum yield strong constraints on atmospheric cloud-top pressure and metallicity, but we are unable to match the relatively shallow Spitzer transit depths without underpredicting the strength of the near-infrared molecular absorption bands. HAT-P-11b?s HST transmission spectrum is well matched by predictions from our microphysical cloud models. Both forward models and retrievals indicate that HAT-P-11b most likely has a relatively low atmospheric metallicity (Z and Z at the 2? and 3? levels respectively), in contrast to the expected trend based on the solar system planets. Our work also demonstrates that the wide wavelength coverage provided by the addition of the HST STIS data is critical for making these inferences.

This signal is consistent with either a stellar companion with a moderate mass ratio (q ? 0.5) on a short period (P < 1 yr), or a substellar companion at a separation wide enough to be resolved with ground-based high-contrast imaging instruments; long-period equal-mass ratio stellar companions that are also consistent with the measured acceleration are excluded with previous imaging observations. The small but significant amplitude of the acceleration made HR 1645 a promising candidate for targeted searches for brown dwarf and planetary-mass companions around nearby, young stars. In this paper we explore the origin of the astrometric acceleration by modeling the signal induced by a wide-orbit M8 companion discovered with the Gemini Planet Imager, as well as the effects of an inner short-period spectroscopic companion discovered a century ago but not since followed up. We present the first constraints on the orbit of the inner companion, and demonstrate that it is a plausible cause of the astrometric acceleration. This result demonstrates the importance of vetting of targets with measured astrometric acceleration for short-period stellar companions prior to conducting targeted direct imaging surveys for wide-orbit substellar companions.

Near-infrared frequency comb generation in mid-infrared interband cascade lasers	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							2ND-HARMONIC GENERATION	The interband cascade laser (ICL) is an ideal candidate for low-power mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate that its intracavity second-order optical nonlinearity induces a coherent up-conversion of the generated mid-infrared light to the near-infrared through second-harmonic and sum-frequency generation. At 1.8 mu m, 10 mW of light at 3.6 mu m convert into subnanowatt levels of optical power, spread across 30 nm of spectral coverage. The observed linear-to-nonlinear conversion efficiency exceeds 3 mu W/W-2 in continuous wave operation. We use a dual-band ICL frequency comb source to characterize water vapor absorption in both spectral bands.

To explore the habitability of Europa, NASA is developing the Europa Clipper mission, currently scheduled to be launched in 2023. Europa resides deep inside the gravity well of Jupiter, in a region of the magnetosphere with many trapped ionized particles that when accelerated to near relativistic speeds result in a radiation environment detrimental to spacecraft electronics; a Europa orbiter mission that would continuously reside in the same radiation environment as Europa would require a large amount of Delta V for an orbit insertion maneuver, and would only return limited science data before being critically exposed to radiation. To mitigate these issues, Europa Clipper will instead use a high number of Europa flybys, connected by resonant and nonresonant transfers. Science data are collected during high-radiation Europa flybys, and returned to Earth during the rest of the highly elliptical Jovian orbits, at a much lower radiation dose exposure. This paper will present several tour techniques developed for the design of the Europa Clipper flyby trajectory. In particular, this paper will describe different ways to perform fast line-of-apsides rotations; a new approach to improve the coverage of Europa's trailing and leading edges; parametric studies of the expected radiation dose and time of flight as function of the Europa resonance; and a quick way to estimate the radiation dose for complete Jovian tours. Other techniques, which were already presented in previous papers, will be reviewed for completeness. Then some of the new approaches will be implemented in the 18F17 tour.

The sample is primarily from the Two Micron All Sky Survey Large Galaxy Atlas (Jarrett et al. 2003) and extended to include nearby dwarf galaxies and more distant giant ellipticals, and spans fully the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram including the blue cloud and red sequence. We present an initial overview, including deep images of our galaxies. Our observations reproduce previously reported low surface brightness structures, including extended plumes in M 51, and a newly discovered tidally extended dwarf galaxy in NGC7331. Low surface brightness structures, or 'envelopes', exceeding 50 kpc in diameter are found mostly in galaxies with MV < -20.5, and classic interaction signatures are infrequent. Defining a halo diameter at the surface brightness 28 mag arcsec-2, we find that halo diameter is correlated with total galaxy luminosity. Extended signatures of interaction are found throughout the galaxy colour-magnitude diagram without preference for the red or blue sequences, or the green valley. Large envelopes may be found throughout the colour-magnitude diagram with some preference for the bright end of the red sequence. Spiral and S0 galaxies have broadly similar sizes, but ellipticals extend to notably greater diameters, reaching 150 kpc. We propose that the extended envelopes of disc galaxies are dominated by an extension of the disc population rather than by a classical Population II halo.	[Rich, R.

Invariant manifolds and the capture of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						celestial mechanics; ephemerides; comets: individual: Shoemaker -Levy 9; planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability	SATELLITE CAPTURE; RESONANCE; DYNAMICS; ORBITS; ORIGIN	The impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9) with Jupiter in 1994 was the ultimate confirmation of Eugene Shoemaker's theory that impacts are a common, fundamental process in the Solar System. On Earth, asteroid impacts have produced several near extinction level events. We tend to visualize these collisions as billiard balls hitting one another. But how, exactly, do they occur? The actual dynamics is much more complex and subtle because it is highly non-linear and involves chaos in the three-body problem. In this paper, we investigate the effects of Lyapunov orbits, halo orbits, and their associated invariant manifolds, on the orbital motion of SL9, We demonstrate that periodic orbits act as gateways to Jupiter, and their invariant manifolds controlled the dynamics of SL9 during the initial capture phase.

The impact of Coriolis approximations on the environmental sensitivity of idealized extratropical cyclones	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Extratropical cyclones; Climate change; Latent heat release; Dynamical meteorology; Idealized modeling; Midlatitude meteorology	LATENT-HEAT RELEASE; LIFE-CYCLE; BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY; ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION; DIABATIC PROCESSES; CLIMATE; SIMULATIONS; TEMPERATURE; ATMOSPHERE; DYNAMICS	The precise influence of climate change on extratropical cyclone genesis and evolution is an important (but as yet unsolved) problem, given their physical and economic impact on a large portion of the planet's population. However, extratropical cyclones are also affected by the competing influences of forcing mechanisms at a wide range of spatial scales, complicating the problem. While the advent of idealized numerical modeling has allowed great strides in addressing these complications and achieving some qualitative consensus in the literature, there is still some quantitative disagreement about response magnitude and where local maxima and minima in the response may be located. Thus, the advantages inherent in the variety of idealized numerical modeling methods used to address this problem are also a drawback, as it can be difficult to draw one-to-one comparisons across experiments. Although the effects of particular model architecture choices such as microphysical and cumulus schemes are well-documented, others are less understood. In this study, we examine the role of Coriolis approximations by comparing a new set of ETC sensitivity experiments using a linear beta -plane approximation to an existing set of extratropical sensitivity experiments using a constant f-plane approximation. ETCs within the new beta -plane experiment are found to generally decrease in strength with temperature, as measured by both minimum sea level pressure and maximum eddy kinetic energy (EKE). A small increase in EKE is observed at the warmest temperatures, likely due to diabatic influences disrupting flow within the warm conveyor belt. While seemingly contradictory to the previous f-plane results, the two experiments are instead found to be qualitatively similar upon further inspection, with an offset of approximately 8 K. This offset is primarily due to the Coriolis approximations, although the initial stability profile (affected by the Coriolis approximation) has a marginal influence.

We used a database of 77 measured and dated impact sites, with craters with diameters between 2.1 and 33.8 m, along with inferred impact angle, bolide trajectory, and varying target material properties to empirically scale for the momentum, expected seismic source function, and radiation pattern of impacts. The impact source is simulated in a local 3-D finite difference wave propagation code and coupled to teleseismic distances by scaling the spectra of 1-D global synthetic seismograms. We use the InSight seismometer noise floors to estimate detectability of impact(s) across azimuth and distance. Our experiments reveal that impact clusters have a higher peak corner frequency resulting from energy contributed by smaller craters to the power spectrum. We also find that the time separation between individual impacts in a cluster is small (<10-15 ms) and requires a seismometer closely situated to the source (<10 km) and a high sampling rate (>100 Hz) to resolve individual impacts within the cluster. Two of the clusters in our database (>20-m effective diameter) would have been detectable by InSight, with the assumptions that the Martian background noise and seismic attenuation are both low. Joint detection of surface changes from newly formed crater(s) in images and by InSight will provide precise source locations that are crucial for constraining the internal structure of Mars.

Contemporaneous Observations of Jovian Energetic Auroral Electrons and Ultraviolet Emissions by the Juno Spacecraft	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						Jupiter aurora; electron precipitation; ultraviolet emission; Juno; UVS; JEDI	JUPITERS MAGNETIC-FIELD; MAGNETOSPHERE; MODEL; FLUX; PRECIPITATION; ACCELERATION; METHANE; REGION; OVAL	We present comparisons of precipitating electron flux and auroral brightness measurements made during several Juno transits over Jupiter's auroral regions in both hemispheres. We extract from the ultraviolet spectrograph (UVS) spectral imager H-2 emission intensities at locations magnetically conjugate to the spacecraft using the JRM09 model. We use UVS images as close in time as possible to the electron measurements by the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) instrument. The upward electron flux generally exceeds the downward component and shows a broadband energy distribution. Auroral intensity is related to total precipitated electron flux and compared with the energy-integrated JEDI flux inside the loss cone. The far ultraviolet color ratio along the spacecraft footprint maps variations of the mean energy of the auroral electron precipitation. A wide diversity of situations has been observed. The intensity of the diffuse emission equatorward of the main oval is generally in fair agreement with the JEDI downward energy flux. The intensity of the ME matches exceeds or remains below the value expected from the JEDI electron energy flux. The polar emission may be more than an order of magnitude brighter than associated with the JEDI electron flux in association with high values of the color ratio. We tentatively explain these observations by the location of the electron energization region relative to Juno's orbit as it transits the auroral region. Current models predict that the extent and the altitude of electron acceleration along the magnetic field lines are consistent with this assumption.	[Gerard, J-C; Bonfond, B.; Yao, Z.

Migrating Scarps as a Significant Driver for Cometary Surface Evolution	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							WATER ICE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SUBLIMATION; NUCLEUS; CAMERA; SHAPE; GEOMORPHOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY; INSOLATION; ROUGHNESS	Rosetta observations of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) reveal that most changes occur in the fallback-generated smooth terrains, vast deposits of granular material blanketing the comet's northern hemisphere. These changes express themselves both morphologically and spectrally across the nucleus, yet we lack a model that describes their formation and evolution. Here we present a self-consistent model that thoroughly explains the activity and mass loss from Hapi's smooth terrains. Our model predicts the removal of dust via reradiated solar insolation localized within depression scarps that are substantially more ice rich than previously expected. We couple our model with numerous Rosetta observations to thoroughly capture the seasonal erosion of Hapi's smooth terrains, where local scarp retreat gradually removes the uppermost dusty mantle. As sublimation-regolith interactions occur on rocky planets, comets, icy moons, and Kuiper belt objects, our coupled model and observations provide a foundation for future understanding of the myriad of sublimation-carved worlds.

Using Machine Learning to Automatically Detect Volcanic Unrest in a Time Series of Interferograms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						sICA; volcano monitoring; InSAR; Sentinel-1; ICASAR; FastICA	SIERRA-NEGRA-VOLCANO; WESTERN GALAPAGOS ARCHIPELAGO; SURFACE DEFORMATION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MAGMA; CONSTRAINTS; INFLATION; INVERSION; DEFLATION; INSIGHTS	The latest generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites produce measurements of ground deformation at the majority of the world's subaerial active volcanoes and can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. We present an automatic detection algorithm that uses these data to automatically warn when deformation at a volcano departs from the background. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic data sets and the unrest leading to the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra (Galapagos). Our algorithm encompasses spatial independent component analysis and uses a significantly improved version of the ICASO algorithm, which we term ICASAR, to robustly perform spatial independent component analysis. We use ICASAR to isolate signals of geophysical interest from atmospheric signals, before monitoring the evolution of these signals through time in order to detect the onset of a period of volcanic unrest.
