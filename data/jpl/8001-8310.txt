Results of laboratory tests with prototype detectors and spectrometers are discussed. TIME-Pilot is a new mm-wavelength grating spectrometer array under development that will study the Epoch of Reionization (the period of time when the first stars and galaxies ionized the intergalactic medium) by mapping the fluctuations of the redshifted 157.7 mu m emission line of singly ionized carbon ([CII]) from redshift z similar to 5.2 to 8.5. As a tracer of star formation, the [CII] power spectrum can provide information on the sources driving reionization and complements 21 cm data (which traces neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium). Intensity mapping provides a measure of the mean [CII] intensity without the need to resolve and detect faint sources individually. We plan to target a 1 degree by 0.35 arcminute field on the sky and a spectral range of 199-305 GHz, producing a spatial-spectral slab which is 140 Mpc by 0.9 Mpc on-end and 1230 Mpc in the redshift direction. With careful removal of intermediate-redshift CO sources, we anticipate a detection of the halo-halo clustering term in the [CII] power spectrum consistent with current models for star formation history in 240 hours on the JCMT. TIME-Pilot will use two stacks of 16 parallel-plate waveguide spectrometers (one stack per polarization) with a resolving power R similar to 100 and a spectral range of 183 to 326 GHz. The range is divided into 60 spectral channels, of which 16 at the band edges on each spectrometer serve as atmospheric monitors. The diffraction gratings are curved to produce a compact instrument, each focusing the diffracted light onto an output arc sampled by the 60 bolometers. The bolometers are built in buttable dies of 8 (low freqeuency) or 12 (high frequency) spectral channels by 8 spatial channels and are mated to the spectrometer stacks. Each detector consists of a gold micro-mesh absorber and a titanium transition edge sensor (TES). The detectors (1920 total) are designed to operate from a 250 mK base temperature in an existing cryostat with a photon-noise-dominated NEP of similar to 2 * 10(-17) WHz(-1/2). A set of flexible superconducting cables connect the detectors to a time-domain multiplexing SQUID readout system.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0207-6; 978-1-5106-0208-3				2016	9914		1						UNSP 99140L	10.1117/12.2233762							WOS:000385793800014

These modular arrays are composed of horn-coupled, polarization-sensitive MKIDs, and each pixel has four detectors: two polarizations in two spectral bands between 125 and 280 GHz. A horn is used to feed each array element, and a planar orthomode transducer, composed of two waveguide probe pairs, separates the incoming light into two linear polarizations. Diplexers composed of resonant-stub band-pass filters separate the radiation into 125 to 170 GHz and 190 to 280 GHz pass bands. The millimeter-wave power is ultimately coupled to a hybrid co-planar waveguide microwave kinetic inductance detector using a novel, broadband circuit developed by our collaboration. Electromagnetic simulations show the expected absorption efficiency of the detector is approximately 90%. Array fabrication will begin in the summer of 2016.

Optical characterization of the BICEP3 CMB polarimeter at the South Pole	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy VIII	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				BICEP3 is a small-aperture refracting cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescope designed to make sensitive polarization maps in pursuit of a potential B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves. It is the latest in the BICEP/Keck Array series of CMB experiments located at the South Pole, which has provided the most stringent constraints on inflation to date. For the 2016 observing season, BICEP3 was outfitted with a full suite of 2400 optically coupled detectors operating at 95 GHz. In these proceedings we report on the far field beam performance using calibration data taken during the 2015-2016 summer deployment season in situ with a thermal chopped source. We generate high-fidelity per-detector beam maps, show the array-averaged beam profile, and characterize the differential beam response between co-located, orthogonally polarized detectors which contributes to the leading instrumental systematic in pair differencing experiments. We find that the levels of differential pointing, beamwidth, and ellipticity are similar to or lower than those measured for BICEP2 and Keck Array. The magnitude and distribution of BICEP3's differential beam mismatch - and the level to which temperature-to-polarization leakage may be marginalized over or subtracted in analysis - will inform the design of next-generation CMB experiments with many thousands of detectors.

Three cryogenic MMIC (monolithic microwave integrated circuit) amplifiers manufactured in InP 35-nm technology are combined in a block with waveguide probes and gain equalizers to cover the 80-116 GHz band. These are followed by a sideband-separating mixer that has two 17 GHZ wide outputs, for upper and lower sidebands. Each receiver has a feed horn followed by a circular-to-linear polarizer and orthomode transducer. The two polarizations are amplified by the cryogenic MMICs, and the outputs downconverted in sideband separating mixers, resulting in four 1-18 GHz channels that can be simultaneously correlated. The first receiver was tested in the lab, and on-sky tests conducted at CARMA. Measured noise temperatures were in the range 40-70 K, with a sideband rejection of about 15 dB.				; Reeves, Rodrigo/H-2812-2014	Varonen, Mikko/0000-0002-6515-5092; Reeves, Rodrigo/0000-0001-5704-271X												0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0207-6; 978-1-5106-0208-3				2016	9914		1						UNSP 99140H	10.1117/12.2233106							WOS:000385793800011

The detectors are horn-coupled, and each array element contains two single-polarization LEKIDs, which are made from thin-film aluminum and optimized for a single spectral band centered on 150 GHz. We are developing two array architectures, one based on 160 micron thick silicon wafers and the other based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with a 30 micron thick device layer. The 20-element test arrays (40 LEKIDs) are characterized with both a linearly-polarized electronic millimeter wave source and a thermal source. We present initial measurements including the noise spectra, noise-equivalent temperature, and responsivity. We discuss future testing and further design optimizations to be implemented.

We report on the status of a technology development effort to build an all-solid-state heterodyne receiver at 2.06 THz that will allow the measurement of the 2.06 THz [OI] line for altitudes greater than 100 km. The receiver front end features low-parasitic Schottky diode mixer chips that are driven by a local oscillator (LO) source using Schottky diode based multipliers. The multiplier chain consists of a 38 GHz oscillator followed by a set of three cascaded triplers at 114 GHz, 343 GHz and 1.03 THz.

The KAPPa instrument is a terahertz heterodyne receiver using a Superconducting-Insulating-Superconducting (SIS) mixers. To improve performance, SIS mixers require a magnetic field to suppress Josephson noise. The KAPPa test receiver can house a tunable electromagnet used to optimize the applied magnetic field. The receiver is also capable of accommodating a permanent magnet that applies a fixed field. Our permanent magnet design uses off-the-shelf neodymium permanent magnets and then reshapes the magnetic field using machined steel concentrators. These concentrators allow the use of an unmachined permanent magnet in the back of the detector block while two small posts provide the required magnetic field across the SIS junction in the detector cavity. The KAPPa test receiver is uniquely suited to compare the permanent magnet and electromagnet receiver performance. The current work includes our design of a 'U' shaped permanent magnet, the testing and calibration procedure for the permanent magnet, and the overall results of the performance comparison between the electromagnet and the permanent magnet counterpart.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0207-6; 978-1-5106-0208-3				2016	9914		1						UNSP 99141W	10.1117/12.2231358							WOS:000385793800045

SuperSpec: Development Towards a Full-Scale Filter Bank	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy VIII	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				SuperSpec is a new spectrometer-on-a-chip technology for submm/mm-wave spectroscopy. SuperSpec stands out from other direct-detection submm spectrometer technologies in that the detectors are coupled to a series of resonant filters along a single microwave feedline instead of using dispersive optics. SuperSpec makes use of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to detect radiation in this filter bank. The small profile of this design makes SuperSpec a natural choice to produce a multi-object spectrometer for tomographic mapping or galaxy redshift surveys. We have recently fabricated a device that is a 50 channel subset of a full 280 channel filter bank, which would cover the 190- 310 GHz range at R = 275. Analysis of the data from this device informs us of the potential design modifications to enable a high-yield background-limited SuperSpec spectrometer. The results indicate that this subset filter bank can scale up to a full filter bank with only a few collisions in readout space and less than 20% variation in responsivity for the detectors. Additionally, the characterization of this and other prototype devices suggests that the noise performance is limited by generation-recombination noise. Finally, we find that the detectors are sufficiently sensitive for ground-based spectroscopy at R = 100, appropriate for tomographic mapping experiments. Further modifications are required to reach the background limit for R = 400, ideal for spectroscopy of individual galaxies.

We present the interface control and the modular structure of the software, along with corresponding prototypes and class definitions for some of the software modules. More specifically, we focus on describing the main steps of our high-fidelity mission simulator EXOSIMS, i.e., the completeness, optical system and zodiacal light modules definition, the target list module filtering, and the creation of a planet population within our simulated universe module. For the latter, we introduce the integration of a recent mass-radius model from the FORECASTER software. We also provide custom modules dedicated to WFIRST using both the Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and the Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) for detection and characterization, respectively.

This paper focuses on leveraging the Executable System Engineering Method (ESEM) [1] [2], which automates requirements verification (e.g. power and mass budget margins and duration analysis of operational modes) using executable SysML [3] models. The particular value proposition is to integrate requirements, and executable behavior and performance models for certain types of system level analysis. The models are created with modeling patterns that involve structural, behavioral and parametric diagrams, and are managed by an open source Model Based Engineering Environment (named OpenMBEE [4]). This paper demonstrates how the ESEM is applied in conjunction with OpenMBEE to create key engineering products (e.g. operational concept document) for the Alignment and Phasing System (APS) within the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) project [5], which is under development by the TMT International Observatory (TIO) [5].																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0201-4; 978-1-5106-0202-1				2016	9911		1						UNSP 99110B	10.1117/12.2232785							WOS:000385794000008

Optical error budgeting using linearized ray-trace models	MODELING, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOR ASTRONOMY VII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Modeling, Systems Engineering, and Project Management for Astronomy VII	JUN 26-28, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The Root-Sum-Squared, or "RSS" wavefront error model is a simple, scalar tool, commonly used for space telescope error budgeting. At the same time, much more detailed models, combining ray-trace and Fourier optics with optical alignments and wavefront controls, can provide accurate, high-resolution simulations for detailed system and subsystem design. This paper makes a connection between the two modeling approaches by deriving RSS model coefficients from ray-trace models, including the effects of wavefront controls, for computing system performance from component error statistics. It is shown that, properly constructed, the simple RSS error budget is a covariance analysis, and can be as accurate as high-resolution wavefront models for statistical wavefront error prediction. A notional segmented-aperture space telescope is used to illustrate this error modeling process.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0201-4; 978-1-5106-0202-1				2016	9911		1						UNSP 99110F	10.1117/12.2234484							WOS:000385794000012

High contrast imaging (HCI) instruments equipped with coronagraphs are built to meet these challenges, providing a way of spatially suppressing and separating stellar flux from that of a planet. Another way of separating stellar flux can be achieved by high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS), exploiting the fact that spectral features are different between a star and a planet. Observing exoplanets with HCI+HRS will achieve a higher contrast than the spatial or the spectroscopic method alone, improving the sensitivity to planet detection and enabling the study of the physical and chemical processes. Here, we simulate the performance of a HCI+HRS instrument (i.e., the upgrade Keck NIRSPEC and the fiber injection unit) to study its potential in detecting and characterizing currently known directly imaged planets. The simulation considers the spectral information content of an exoplanet, telescope and instrument specifications and realistic noise sources. The result of the simulation helps to set system requirement and informs designs at system-level.

We present our detailed investigation results on the adequacy of such a limited number of finite subband filters in achieving broadband dark hole contrast with a shaped pupil coronagraph (SPC). The study is based on diffraction propagation modeling with realistic WFIRST optics, where each subband's image plane electric field is estimated from pairwise pupil plane deformable mirror (DM) probing and image plane intensity averaging of the resulting fields of multiple (subband) wavelengths. Multiple subband choices and probing and control strategies are explored, including standard subband probing; mixed wavelength and/or weighted Jacobian matrix; subband probing with intensity subtraction; and extended subband probing with intensity subtraction. Overall, the investigation shows that the achievable contrast with a limited number of finite subbands is about 2 similar to 2.5x worse than the designed contrast for the current SPC. The result suggests that future shaped pupil designs should be optimized for slightly broader bandwidths than the intended science bandpasses if limited subbands are used for wavefront sensing via probing.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0201-4; 978-1-5106-0202-1				2016	9911		1						UNSP 99111S	10.1117/12.2232129							WOS:000385794000052

The maturing of high contrast imaging and starlight suppression techniques for future NASA exoplanet characterization missions	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Over 3000 exoplanets and hundreds of exoplanetary systems have been detected to date and we are now rapidly moving toward an era where the focus is shifting from detection to direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of these new worlds and their atmospheres. NASA is currently studying several exoplanet characterization mission concepts for the 2020 Decadal Survey ranging from probe class to flagships. Detailed and comprehensive exoplanet characterization, particularly of exo-Earths, leading to assessment of habitability, or indeed detection of life, will require significant advances beyond the current state-of-the-art in high contrast imaging and starlight suppression techniques which utilize specially shaped precision optical elements to block the light from the parent star while controlling scattering and diffraction thus revealing and enabling spectroscopic study of the orbiting exoplanets in reflected light. In this paper we describe the two primary high contrast starlight suppression techniques currently being pursued by NASA: 1) coronagraphs (including several design variations) and 2) free-flying starshades. These techniques are rapidly moving from the technology development phase to the design and engineering phase and we discuss the prospects and projected performance for future exoplanet characterization missions utilizing these techniques coupled with large aperture telescopes in space.

The latest results from DICE (Detector Interferometric Calibration Experiment)	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Theia is an astrometric mission proposed to ESA in 2014 for which one of the scientific objectives is detecting Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby solar-type stars. This objective requires the capability to measure stellar centroids at the precision of 1 x 10-5 pixel. Current state-of-the-art methods for centroid estimation have reached a precision of about 3 x 10-5 pixel at two times Nyquist sampling, this was shown at the JPL by the VESTA experiment. A metrology system was used to calibrate intra and inter pixel quantum efficiency variations in order to correct pixelation errors. The Theia consortium is operating a testbed in vacuum in order to achieve 1 x 10-5 pixel precision for the centroid estimation. The goal is to provide a proof of concept for the precision requirement of the Theia spacecraft. The testbed consists of two main sub-systems. The first one produces pseudo stars: a blackbody source is fed into a large core fiber and lights-up a pinhole mask in the object plane, which is imaged by a mirror on the CCD. The second sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The fringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the mirror. In this paper we present the latest experiments conducted and the results obtained after a series of upgrades on the testbed was completed. The calibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy estimated at 4 x 10-4 pixel. After including the pixel position information, an astrometric accuracy of 6 x 10-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more than 5 pixels. In the static mode (small jitter motion of less than 1 x 10-3 pixel), a photon noise limited precision of 3 x 10-5 pixel was reached.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904																WOS:000385794100155

JOST is complementary to existing testbeds for JWST (e.g. the Ball Aerospace Testbed Telescope TBT) given its compact scale and flexibility, ease of use, and colocation at the JWST Science & Operations Center. The design of JOST reproduces the physics of JWST's three-mirror anastigmat (TMA) using three custom aspheric lenses. It provides similar quality image as JWST (80% Strehl ratio) over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module, but at 633 nm. An Iris AO segmented mirror stands for the segmented primary mirror of JWST. Actuators allow us to control (1) the 18 segments of the segmented mirror in piston, tip, tilt and (2) the second lens, which stands for the secondary mirror, in tip, tilt and x, y, z positions. We present the full linear control alignment infrastructure developed for JOST, with an emphasis on multi-field wavefront sensing and control. Our implementation of the Wavefront Sensing (WFS) algorithms using phase diversity is experimentally tested. The wavefront control (WFC) algorithms, which rely on a linear model for optical aberrations induced by small misalignments of the three lenses, are tested and validated on simulations.

Modelling Effects of Common Molecular Contaminants on the Euclid Infrared Detectors	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Cleanliness specifications for infrared detector arrays are usually so stringent that effects are neglibile. However, the specifications determine only the level of particulates and areal density of molecular layer on the surface, but the chemical composition of these contaminants are not specified. Here, we use a model to assess the impact on system quantum efficiency from possible contaminants that could accidentally transfer or cryopump to the detector during instrument or spacecraft testing and on orbit operation. Contaminant layers thin enough to meet typical specifications, < 0.5 mu gram/cm(2), have a negligible effect on the net quantum efficiency of the detector, provided that the contaminant does not react with the detector surface, Performance impacts from these contaminant plating onto the surface become important for thicknesses 5 - 50 mu gram/cm(2). Importantly, detectable change in the "ripple" of the anti reflection coating occurs at these coverages and can enhance the system quantum efficiency. This is a factor 10 less coverage for which loss from molecular absorption lines is important. Thus, should contamination be suspected during instrument test or flight, detailed modelling of the layer on the detector and response to very well known calibrations sources would be useful to determine the impact on detector performance.

The Planetary Homodyne Interferometer (PHI) can offer integrated spectra over a wide field-of-view (FOV) in high spectral resolution (R similar to 10(5)) in a compact design using no (or a small < 1m) primary mirror. PHI is best suited to studies of sources where temporally tracing specific spectral features sensitivity, and spectral resolution is of higher significance than spatial fidelity.

A dynamic Zernike wavefront sensor (WFS) with four phase shifts, for reducing error due to spurious light and eliminating other asynchronous noise, has been proposed for use in adaptive optics. Here, we propose adapting this method for co-phasing the primary mirror of a segmented space telescope. In order to extend the dynamic range of the WFS, which has a maximum range of +/ A/2, a phase contrast plate with multiple steps, both positive and negative, has been developed such that errors as large as +/ 10A can be sensed. The manufacturing tolerances have been incorporated into simulations, which demonstrate that performance impacts are minimal. We show that the addition of this small optical plate along with a high precision linear translation stage at the prime focus of a telescope and pupil viewing capability can provide extremely accurate segment phasing with a simple white-light fringe fitting algorithm and a closed-loop controller. The original focal-plane geometry of a centro-symmetric phase shifting element is replaced with a much less constrained shape, such as a slot. Also, a dedicated pupil imager is not strictly required; an existing pupil sampler such as a Shack-Hartmann (SH) WFS can be used just as effectively, allowing simultaneous detection of wavefront errors using both intensity and spot positions on the SH-WFS. This could lead to an efficient synergy between Zernike and SH-WFS, enabling segment phasing in conjunction with high-dynamic range sensing.

This test comprised the final cryo-certification and calibration test of the ISIM, after its ambient environmental test program (vibration, acoustics, EMI/EMC), and before its delivery for integration with the rest of the JWST observatory. Over the 108-day period of the round-the-clock test program, the full complement of ISIM flight instruments, structure, harness radiator, and electronics were put through a comprehensive program of thermal, optical, electrical, and operational tests. The test verified the health and excellent performance of the instruments and ISIM systems, proving the ISIM element's readiness for integration with the telescope. We report here on the context, goals, setup, execution, and key results for this critical JWST milestone.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904								UNSP 990408	10.1117/12.2231554							WOS:000385794100007

Status and wavefront control development	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Segmented telescopes are a possible approach to enable large-aperture space telescopes for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of habitable worlds. However, the increased complexity of their aperture geometry, due to their central obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging very challenging. The High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) was designed to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils using wavefront control and starlight suppression. The testbed design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing complexity for telescope aperture geometries starting with off-axis telescopes, then on-axis telescopes with central obstruction and support structures (e.g. the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope [WFIRST]), up to on-axis segmented telescopes e.g. including various concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope (LUVOIR), such as the High Definition Space Telescope (HDST). We completed optical alignment in the summer of 2014 and a first deformable mirror was successfully integrated in the testbed, with a total wavefront error of 13nm RMS over a 18mm diameter circular pupil in open loop. HiCAT will also be provided with a segmented mirror conjugated with a shaped pupil representing the HDST configuration, to directly study wavefront control in the presence of segment gaps, central obstruction and spider. We recently applied a focal plane wavefront control method combined with a classical Lyot coronagraph on HiCAT, and we found limitations on contrast performance due to vibration effect. In this communication, we analyze this instability and study its impact on the performance of wavefront control algorithms. We present our Speckle Nulling code to control and correct for wavefront errors both in simulation mode and on testbed mode. This routine is first tested in simulation mode without instability to validate our code. We then add simulated vibrations to study the degradation of contrast performance in the presence of these effects.

Low-Signal, Coronagraphic Wavefront Estimation with Kalman Filtering in the High Contrast Imaging Testbed	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				For direct imaging and spectral characterization of cold exoplanets in reflected light, the proposed Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) will carry two types of coronagraphs. The High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been testing both coronagraph types and demonstrated their abilities to achieve high contrast. Focal plane wavefront correction is used to estimate and mitigate aberrations. As the most time-consuming part of correction during a space mission, the acquisition of probed images for electric field estimation needs to be as short as possible. We present results from the HCIT of narrowband, low-signal wavefront estimation tests using a shaped pupil Lyot coronagraph (SPLC) designed for the WFIRST CGI. In the low-flux regime, the Kalman filter and iterated extended Kalman filter provide faster correction, better achievable contrast, and more accurate estimates than batch process estimation.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904								UNSP 99043F	10.1117/12.2233909							WOS:000385794100099

The Far Infrared Spectroscopic Explorer (FIRSPEX): Probing the lifecycle of the ISM in the Universe	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The Far Infrared Spectroscopic Explorer (FIRSPEX) is a novel European-led astronomy mission concept developed to enable large area ultra high spectroscopic resolution surveys in the THz regime. FIRSPEX opens up a relatively unexplored spectral and spatial parameter space that will produce an enormously significant scientific legacy by focusing on the properties of the multi-phase ISM, the assembly of molecular clouds in our Galaxy and the onset of star formation; topics which are fundamental to our understanding of galaxy evolution. The mission uses a heterodyne instrument and a similar to 1.2 m primary antenna to scan large areas of the sky in a number of discreet spectroscopic channels from L2. The FIRSPEX bands centered at [CI] 809 GHz, [NII] 1460 GHz, [CII] 1900 GHz and [OI] 4700 GHz have been carefully selected to target key atomic and ionic fine structure transitions difficult or impossible to access from the ground but fundamental to the study of the multi-phase ISM in the Universe. The need for state-of-the-art sensitivity dictates the use of superconducting mixers configured either as tunnel junctions or hot electron bolometers. This technology requires cooling to low temperatures, approaching 4K, in order to operate. The receivers will operate in double sideband configuration providing a total of 7 pixels on the sky. FIRSPEX will operate from L2 in both survey and pointed mode enabling velocity resolved spectroscopy of large areas of sky as well as targeted observations.

As part of the preparation for the Decadal Survey, NASA is currently undertaking studies of four major missions, but interest has also been shown in determining if there are feasible sub-$1B missions that could provide significant scientific return. SHARP-IR is being designed as one such potential probe. In this talk, we will discuss some of the potential scientific questions that could be addressed with the mission, the current design, and the path forward to concept maturation.

The LOWFS/C uses the rejected stellar light from coronagraph to sense and suppress the telescope pointing drift and jitter as well as the low order wavefront errors due to changes in thermal loading on the telescope and the rest of the observatory. In this paper we will present an overview of the low order wavefront sensing and control subsystem for the WFIRST Coronagraph and describe the WFIRST Coronagraph LOWFS function, its design, and modeled performance. We will present experimental results on a dedicated LOWFS/C testbed that show that the LOWFS/C subsystem not only can sense pointing errors better than 0.2 mas but has also experimentally demonstrated closed loop pointing error suppression with residuals better than 0.4 mas rms per axis for the vast majority of observatory reaction wheel speeds.

Measurements of high-contrast starshade performance in the field	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The external starshade is a method for the direct detection and spectral characterization of terrestrial planets around other stars, a key goal identified in ASTRO2010. In an effort to validate the starlight-suppression performance of the starshade, we have measured contrast better than 1x10(-9) using 60 cm starshades at points just beyond the starshade tips. These measurements were made over a 50% spectral bandpass, using an incoherent light source (a white LED), and in challenging outdoor test environments. Our experimental setup is designed to provide starshade to telescope separation and telescope aperture size that are scaled as closely as possible to the flight system. The measurements confirm not only the overall starlight-suppression capability of the starshade concept but also the robustness of the setup to optical disturbances such as atmospheric effects at the test site. The spectral coverage is limited only by the optics and detectors in our test setup, not by the starshade itself. Here we describe our latest results as well as detailed comparisons of the measured results to model predictions. Plans and status of the next phase of ground testing are also discussed.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904								UNSP 99043K	10.1117/12.2232841							WOS:000385794100104

Currently, coronagraphs and starshades are being considered as instruments for such a mission. We will use a novel code to estimate and compare the yields for starshade- and coronagraph-based missions. We will show yield scaling relationships for each instrument and discuss the impact of astrophysical and instrumental noise on yields. Although the absolute yields are dependent on several yet-unknown parameters, we will present several limiting cases allowing us to bound the yield comparison.

Challenges remain, however, in the technology readiness for the proposed mission. One is the discrepancies between the achieved contrasts on the testbeds and their corresponding model predictions. A series of testbed diagnoses and modeling activities were planned and carried out on the SPC testbed in order to close the gap. A very useful tool we developed was a derived "measured" testbed wavefront control Jacobian matrix that could be compared with the model-predicted "control" version that was used to generate the high contrast dark hole region in the image plane. The difference between these two is an estimate of the error in the control Jacobian. When the control matrix, which includes both amplitude and phase, was modified to reproduce the error, the simulated performance closely matched the SPC testbed behavior in both contrast floor and contrast convergence speed. This is a step closer toward model validation for high contrast coronagraphs. Further Jacobian analysis and modeling provided clues to the possible sources for the mismatch: DM misregistration and testbed optical wavefront error (WFE) and the deformable mirror (DM) setting for correcting this WFE. These analyses suggested that a high contrast coronagraph has a tight tolerance in the accuracy of its control Jacobian. Modifications to both testbed control model as well as prediction model are being implemented, and future works are discussed.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904								UNSP 990419	10.1117/12.2232211							WOS:000385794100036

We are now building on those innovations to carry out a survey of Lyot coronagraph performance for large, segmented telescope apertures. These apertures are of the same kind under consideration for NASA's Large UV/Optical/IR (LUVOIR) observatory concept. To map the multi-dimensional design parameter space, we have developed a software toolkit to manage large sets of mask optimization programs and execute them on a computing cluster. Here we summarize a preliminary survey of 500 APLC solutions for 4 reference hexagonal telescope apertures. Several promising designs produce annular, 10(-10) contrast dark zones down to inner working angle 4 lambda(0)/D over a 15% bandpass, while delivering a half-max PSF core throughput of 18%. We also report our progress on devising solutions to the challenges of Lyot stop alignment/fabrication tolerance that arise in this contrast regime.

Low-CNR inverse synthetic aperture LADAR imaging demonstration with atmospheric turbulence	LONG-RANGE IMAGING	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Long-Range Imaging	APR 19, 2016	Baltimore, MD	SPIE				An Inverse Synthetic Aperture LADAR (ISAL) system is capable of providing high resolution surface mapping of near Earth objects which is an ability that has gained significant interest for both exploration and hazard assessment. The use of an ISAL system over these long distances often presents the need to operate the optical system in photon-starved conditions. This leads to a necessity to understand the implications of photon and detector noise in the system. Here a Carrier-to-Noise Ratio is derived which is similar to other optical imaging CNR definitions. The CNR value is compared to the quality of experimentally captured images recovered using the Phase Gradient Autofocus technique both with and without the presence of atmospheric turbulence. A minimum return signal CNR for the PGA to work is observed.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0087-4				2016	9846								UNSP 98460E	10.1117/12.2224322							WOS:000384769000010

In this paper, we describe a cost-effective chirp linearization approach implemented on our Inverse synthetic Aperture LADAR (ISAL) imaging testbed. Our approach uses a COTS PZT for external cavity laser frequency tuning and a common self-heterodyne fiber interferometer as a frequency monitor, with a two-step hardware and software chirp linearization procedure to achieve high quality chirp. First, the nominal triangle waveform input to PZT drive is modified through an iterative process prior to ISAL imaging acquisition. Several waveforms with chirp rates between 1 and 4THz/s have been acquired with residual chirp rate error similar to +/-2% in usable region. This process generally needs to be done only once for a typical PZT that has excellent repeatability but poor linearity. The modified waveform is then used during ISAL imaging acquisition without active control while the imperfection in transmitted frequency is monitored. The received imaging data is resampled digitally based on frequency error calculated from the frequency monitor data, effectively reduce chirp nonlinearity to similar to+/-0.2% in chirp rate error. The measured system impulse response from return signal shows near designed range resolution of a few mm, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0087-4				2016	9846								UNSP 98460D	10.1117/12.2224122							WOS:000384769000009

Model Based Mission Assurance: NASA's Assurance Future	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM 2016 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium				Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 25-28, 2016	Tucson, AZ	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Amer Soc Qual Control Elect Div, IEEE, Ints Environm Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Engineers, SAE Int, SOLE, Soc Reliabil Engineers, Syst Safety Soc, American Society of Quality Control Reliabil Div				Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is seeing increased application in planning and design of NASA's missions. This suggests the question: what will be the corresponding practice of Model Based Mission Assurance (MBMA)? Contemporaneously, NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evaluating a new objectives-based approach to standards to ensure that the Safety and Mission Assurance disciplines and programs are addressing the challenges of NASA's changing missions, acquisition and engineering practices, and technology. MBSE is a prominent example of a changing engineering practice. We use NASA's objectives-based strategy for Reliability and Maintainability as a means to examine how MBSE will affect assurance. We surveyed MBSE literature to look specifically for these affects, and find a variety of them discussed (some are anticipated, some are reported from applications to date). Predominantly these apply to the early stages of design, although there are also extrapolations of how MBSE practices will have benefits for testing phases. As the effort to develop MBMA continues, it will need to clearly and unambiguously establish the roles of uncertainty and risk in the system model. This will enable a variety of uncertainty-based analyses to be performed much more rapidly than ever before and has the promise to increase the integration of CRM (Continuous Risk Management) and PRA (Probabilistic Risk Analyses) even more fully into the project development life cycle. Various views and viewpoints will be required for assurance disciplines, and an over-arching viewpoint will then be able to more completely characterize the state of the project/program as well as (possibly) enabling the safety case approach for overall risk awareness and communication.																	0149-144X		978-1-5090-0249-8				2016																	WOS:000383954600087

Characterizing and Managing System Risks with Selective Redundancy during Early Mission Formulation	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM 2016 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium				Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 25-28, 2016	Tucson, AZ	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Amer Soc Qual Control Elect Div, IEEE, Ints Environm Sci & Technol, Inst Ind Engineers, SAE Int, SOLE, Soc Reliabil Engineers, Syst Safety Soc, American Society of Quality Control Reliabil Div				NASA payload medium-risk projects encounter an architectural need to identify and manage risks associated with selective redundancy. An innovative technique has been developed and implemented on two JPL instruments to help managers make risk-informed decisions during early mission formulation, when design details are often sparse. The process relies on an elicitation approach intended to balance the potential benefits of redundancy against the adverse reliability impacts of additional complexity, potential deviations from heritage practices, and the risk significance/likelihood of a single string failure. Experts in hardware, software, parts, and reliability are asked to rate the likelihood of a system failure due to six broad reliability factors. Those ratings are averaged. Then the experts are asked to rate the likelihood of failure of the same system if it were to be made redundant. While the ratings are subjective, the technique described strives to unify and normalize the ratings between experts and systems. The ratio between the averaged redundant and single-string ratings is called the "improvement factor" and is used to rank redundant systems' ability to lower technical performance risk. By presenting items with the greatest improvement factors on the NASA 5x5 risk matrix, managers can more easily visualize the risk reduction provided by redundancy. The process has been well received at JPL (nominated for a NASA Systems Engineering Excellence Award, as a "unique and immensely useful exercise in quantifying the benefit of redundancy"). It is currently in-use on several Earth science missions, and will be incorporated into the formulation phase of future missions.																	0149-144X		978-1-5090-0249-8				2016																	WOS:000383954600014

Robot perception systems for applications in urban environments need to function effectively in the presence of such materials; however, both passive and active 3-D perception systems have difficulties with them. In this paper, we develop an approach using a stereo pair of polarization cameras to improve passive 3-D perception of specular surfaces. We use a commercial stereo camera pair with rotatable polarization filters in front, of each lens to capture images with multiple orientations of the polarization filter. From these images, we estimate the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) and the angle of polarization (AOP) at each pixel in at least one camera. The AOP constrains the corresponding surface normal in the scene to lie in the plane of the observed angle of polarization. We embody this constraint, an energy functional for a regufarization-based stereo vision algorithm. This paper describes the theory of polarization needed for this approach, describes the new stereo vision algorithm, presents results on synthetic and real images to evaluate performance.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0078-2				2016	9837								98370P	10.1117/12.2231110							WOS:000383224300023

An autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) capable of navigating stealthily at night in offroad and on-road terrain could significantly increase the safety and success rate of such resupply missions for warfighters. Passive night-time perception of terrain and obstacle features is a vital requirement for such missions. As part of the ONR 30 Autonomy Team, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory developed a passive, low-cost night-time perception system under the ONR Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism Applied Research program. Using a stereo pair of forward looking LWIR uncooled microbolometer cameras, the perception system generates disparity maps using a local window-based stereo correlator to achieve real-time performance while maintaining low power consumption. To overcome the lower signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of LWIR thermal imaging technologies, a series of pre-filters were applied to the input images to increase the image contrast and stereo correlator enhancements were applied to increase the disparity density. To overcome false positives generated by mixed pixels, noisy disparities from repeated textures, and uncertainty in far range measurements, a series of consistency, multi-resolution, and temporal based post-filters were employed to improve the fidelity of the output range measurements. The stereo processing leverages multi-core processors and runs under the Robot Operating System (ROS). The night-time passive perception system was tested and evaluated on fully autonomous testbed ground vehicles at SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific (SSC Pacific) and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. This paper describes the challenges, techniques, and experimental results of developing a passive, low-cost perception system for night-time autonomous navigation.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0078-2				2016	9837								98370D	10.1117/12.2222788							WOS:000383224300012

Los Angeles megacity: a high-resolution land-atmosphere modelling system for urban CO2 emissions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Megacities are major sources of anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions. The spatial extents of these large urban systems cover areas of 10 000 km(2) or more with complex topography and changing landscapes. We present a high-resolution land-atmosphere modelling system for urban CO2 emissions over the Los Angeles (LA) megacity area. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)Chem model was coupled to a very high-resolution FFCO2 emission product, Hestia-LA, to simulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations across the LA megacity at spatial resolutions as fine as similar to 1 km. We evaluated multiple WRF configurations, selecting one that minimized errors in wind speed, wind direction, and boundary layer height as evaluated by its performance against meteorological data collected during the CalNex-LA campaign (May-June 2010). Our results show no significant difference between moderate-resolution (4 km) and high-resolution (1.3 km) simulations when evaluated against surface meteorological data, but the highresolution configurations better resolved planetary boundary layer heights and vertical gradients in the horizontal mean winds. We coupled our WRF configuration with the Vul-can 2.2 (10 km resolution) and Hestia-LA (1.3 km resolution) fossil fuel CO2 emission products to evaluate the impact of the spatial resolution of the CO2 emission products and the meteorological transport model on the representation of spatiotemporal variability in simulated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that high spatial resolution in the fossil fuel CO2 emissions is more important than in the atmospheric model to capture CO2 concentration variability across the LA megacity. Finally, we present a novel approach that employs simultaneous correlations of the simulated atmospheric CO2 fields to qualitatively evaluate the greenhouse gas measurement network over the LA megacity. Spatial correlations in the atmospheric CO2 fields reflect the coverage of individual measurement sites when a statistically significant number of sites observe emissions from a specific source or location. We conclude that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the LA megacity are composed of multiple fine-scale plumes rather than a single homogenous urban dome. Furthermore, we conclude that FFCO2 emissions monitoring in the LA megacity requires FFCO2 emissions modelling with similar to 1 km resolution because coarser-resolution emissions modelling tends to overestimate the observational constraints on the emissions estimates.

J	Granados-Munoz, MJ; Leblanc, T				Granados-Munoz, Maria Jose; Leblanc, Thierry			Tropospheric ozone seasonal and long-term variability as seen by lidar and surface measurements at the JPL-Table Mountain Facility, California	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												A combined surface and tropospheric ozone climatology and interannual variability study was performed for the first time using co-located ozone photometer measurements (2013-2015) and tropospheric ozone differential absorption lidar measurements (2000-2015) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Table Mountain Facility (TMF; elev. 2285 m), in California. The surface time series were investigated both in terms of seasonal and diurnal variability. The observed surface ozone is typical of high-elevation remote sites, with small amplitude of the seasonal and diurnal cycles, and high ozone values, compared to neighboring lower altitude stations representative of urban boundary layer conditions. The ozone mixing ratio ranges from 45 ppbv in the winter morning hours to 65 ppbv in the spring and summer afternoon hours. At the time of the lidar measurements (early night), the seasonal cycle observed at the surface is similar to that observed by lidar between 3.5 and 9 km. Above 9 km, the local tropopause height variation with time and season impacts significantly the ozone lidar observations. The frequent tropopause folds found in the vicinity of TMF (27% of the time, mostly in winter and spring) produce a dual-peak vertical structure in ozone within the fold layer, characterized by higher-than-average values in the bottom half of the fold (12-14 km), and lower-than-averaged values in the top half of the fold (14-18 km). This structure is consistent with the expected origin of the air parcels within the fold, i.e., mid-latitude stratospheric air folding down below the upper tropospheric sub-tropical air. The influence of the tropopause folds extends down to 5 km, increasing the ozone content in the troposphere. No significant signature of interannual variability could be observed on the 2000-2015 de-seasonalized lidar time series, with only a statistically non-significant positive anomaly during the years 2003-2007. Our trend analysis reveals however an overall statistically significant positive trend of 0.3 ppbv year(-1) (0.6 %) in the free troposphere (7-10 km) for the period 2000-2015. A classification of the air parcels sampled by lidar was made at 1 km intervals between 5 and 14 km altitude, using 12-day backward trajectories (HYSPLIT, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model). Our classification revealed the influence of the Pacific Ocean, with air parcels of low ozone content (43-60 ppbv below 9 km), and significant influence of the stratosphere leading to ozone values of 57-83 ppbv down to 8-9 km. In summer, enhanced ozone values (76 ppbv at 9 km) were found in air parcels originating from Central America, probably due to the enhanced thunderstorm activity during the North American Monsoon. Influence from Asia was observed throughout the year, with more frequent episodes during spring, associated with ozone values from 53 to 63 ppbv at 9 km.

Increasingly, a broad range of science and user communities have come to depend on the quasi-global precipitation analyses that intercalibrate and merge these individual PMW precipitation data streams. At present, the constellation of precipitation-relevant conical and cross-track scanning multichannel PMW instruments depends on many satellites past their design life and in continued operation by the responsible agencies. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) Water Strategy and subsequent discussions in Coordinating Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) and Committee on Earth Observing Systems (CEOS) have raised the issue of how a robust future precipitation constellation should be constructed. We discuss how retrievals are impacted by sensor resolution and channel diversity, the observation interval, and the use of a quasi-operational satellite precipitation radar for calibration. Specifically: 1) Sensor footprints larger than about 5-10 km start to introduce significant amounts of non-linearity in the retrievals, the so-called beam-filling problem. 2) Channel diversity has been shown to be necessary for covering the range of precipitation rates and types (liquid vs. solid). As well, diverse polarization at a given frequency is also important. 3) An observation interval less than three hours for every time around the day barely accommodates the required revist times for cloud-scale precipitating systems. 4) The precipitation radars on the precessing TRMM and GPM Core Observatory satellites have demonstrated the utility of routine calibration for precipitation estimates across all the PMW sensors (and in the case of GPM this is done for most of the Earth's climate zones). Such considerations are critical to the discussion on how to shift to a new, more diverse generation of precipitation-relevant sensors while preserving the characteristics that provide (and support continued innovation of) quality PMW retrievals and value-added products that many users find attractive.

The retrieval of this information is best achieved with a range of receiver channels across the submillimeter wave range. Advancement of low noise Indium Phosphide (InP) MMIC amplifier technology enabled us to develop miniature submillimeter-wave receivers for a CubeSat scale instrument that achieves 6 km spatial resolution. The heritage of InP MMICs includes continuous operation for four years in the PLANCK Low Frequency Instrument and providing world-record sensitivity with high reliability in several airborne instruments. We have developed a set of InP MMICs for receivers at 240, 310, 380 and 670 GHz with significantly lower noise than previously reported. The noise temperature is NT=450 K at 240 GHz, NT=550K at 310 GHz and NT=650 K at 380 GHz. The 670 GHz LNAs provide a NT of 2400 K. These channels are complemented by the previously-developed and airborne-proven 183 and 118 GHz MMIC receivers that were tested to TRL 6.																			978-1-5090-2951-8				2016							42	47									WOS:000382491900010

We then consider the evolving sequence to be embedded in a deformable medium, and enhance temporal resolution of a sequence using nonlinear viscous fluid registration model. The physical continuum equation is solved using an efficient multigrid full approximation scheme.																			978-1-5090-2951-8				2016							155	160									WOS:000382491900034

The goal is to align the images in the multi sensor suite by correlating multiple key features in the images. Due to the wavelength differences, the object appears very differently in the sensor images even the sensors focus on the same object In order to perform accurate correlation of the same object in the multi-band images, we perform image processing on the images so that the features of the object become similar to each other. Fourier domain band pass filters are used to enhance the images. Mexican Hat and Gaussian Derivative Wavelets are used to further enhance the features of the object. A Python based QT graphical user interface has been implemented to carry out the process. We show reliable results of the cross-correlation of the objects in multiple band videos.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0086-7				2016	9845								984505	10.1117/12.2224694							WOS:000381709400003

Quantifying and monitoring convection intensity from mm-wave sounder observations	REMOTE SENSING AND MODELING OF THE ATMOSPHERE, OCEANS, AND INTERACTIONS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing and Modeling of the Atmosphere, Oceans, and Interactions VI	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			Few systematic attempts to interpret the measurements of mm-wave radiometers over clouds and precipitation have been made to date because the scattering signatures of hydrometeors at these frequencies are very difficult to model. The few algorithms that have been developed try to retrieve surface precipitation, to which the observations are partially correlated but not directly sensitive. In fact, over deep clouds, mm-wave radiometers are most sensitive to the scattering from solid hydrometeors within the upper levels of the cloud. In addition, mm-wave radiometers have a definite advantage over the lower-frequency window-channel radiometers in that they have finer resolution and can therefore explicitly resolve deep convection. Preliminary analyses (in particular of NOAA's MHS brightness temperatures, as well as Megha-Tropiques's SAPHIR observations) indicate that the measurements are indeed very sensitive to the depth and intensity of convection. The challenge is to derive a robust approach to make quantitative estimates of the convection, for example the height and depth of the condensed water, directly from the mm-wave observations, as a function of horizontal location. To avoid having to rely on a specific set of microphysical assumptions, this analysis exploits the substantial amount of nearly simultaneous coincident observations by mm-wave radiometers and orbiting atmospheric profiling radars in order to enforce unbiased consistency between the calculated brightness temperatures and the radar and radiometer observations.

The resonator is isolated from and mechanically coupled to the surrounding fluid using a sealed enclosure. The pressure applied to the enclosure induces a compressive stress to the resonator and reduces its resonance frequency. In principle the mechanism allows for achieving large resonance frequency shifts close to 100% of the resonance frequency. A high-pressure sensor based on the mechanism was designed for down-hole pressure monitoring in oil wells. The sensor is potentially remotely-readable via the transmission of an electromagnetic signal down a waveguide formed by the pipes in the oil well. The details of the pressure sensor design and verification by FE analysis and initial test results of a preliminary prototype are presented in this paper.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0044-7				2016	9803								UNSP 98032O	10.1117/12.2218583							WOS:000382319400074

One of these applications, Sub Critical Water Extraction (SCWE), is a process where water and an environmental powder sample (sieved soil, drill cuttings, etc.) are heated in a sealed chamber to temperatures greater than 200 degrees Celsius by allowing the pressure to increase, but without reaching the critical point of water. At these temperatures, the ability of water to extract organics from solid particulate increases drastically. This paper describes the modeling and experimentation on the use of an acoustic resonant chamber which is part of an amino acid detection instrument called Astrobionibbler [Noell et al. 2014, 2015]. In this instrument we use acoustics to excite a fluid- solid fines mixture in different frequency/amplitude regimes to accomplish a variety of sample processing tasks. Driving the acoustic resonant chamber at lower frequencies can create circulation patterns in the fluid and mixes the liquid and fines, while driving the chamber at higher frequencies one can agitate the fluid and powder and create a suspension. If one then drives the chamber at high amplitude at resonance heating of the slurry occurs. In the mixing and agitating cell the particle levitation force depends on the relative densities and compressibility's of the particulate and fluid and on the kinetic and potential energy densities associated with the velocity and pressure fields [Glynne-Jones, Boltryk and Hill 2012] in the cell. When heating, the piezoelectric transducer and chamber is driven at high power in resonance where the solid/fines region is modelled as an acoustic transmission line with a large loss component. In this regime, heat is pumped into the solution/fines mixture and rapidly heats the sample. We have modeled the piezoelectric transducer/chamber/ sample using Mason's equivalent circuit. In order to assess the validity of the model we have built and tested a variety of chambers. This paper describes the experimental results which are in general agreement with theory within the limitations of the modeling.

Development of Multi-Physics Dynamics Models for High-Frequency Large-Amplitude Structural Response Simulation	SPECIAL TOPICS IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS, VOL 6, 34TH IMAC	Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series				34th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics	JAN 25-28, 2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Experimental Mech				An analytic approach is demonstrated to reveal potential pyroshock-driven dynamic effects causing temporary power losses in the Thermo-Electric (TE) module bars of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG). This study utilizes high-fidelity finite element analysis with SIERRA/PRESTO codes to estimate wave propagation effects due to large-amplitude suddenly-applied pyroshock loads in the MMRTG. A high fidelity model of the TE module bar was created with similar to 30 million degrees-of-freedom (DOF). First, a quasi-static preload was applied on top of the TE module bar, then transient tri-axial displacement inputs were simultaneously applied on the preloaded module. The applied displacement inputs were derived from measured acceleration signals during MMRTG shock qualification tests performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An explicit finite element solver in the SIERRA/PRESTO computational environment, along with a 3000 processor parallel super-computing framework at NASA-AMES, was used for the simulation. The simulation results were investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The predicted shock wave propagation results provide detailed structural responses throughout the TE module bar, and key insights into the dynamic response (i.e., loads, displacements, accelerations) of critical internal spring/piston compression systems, TE materials, and internal component interfaces in the MMRTG TE module bar. They also provide confidence on the viability of this high-fidelity modeling scheme to accurately predict shock wave propagation patterns within complex structures. This analytic approach is envisioned for modeling shock sensitive hardware susceptible to intense shock environments positioned near shock separation devices in modern space vehicles and systems.																	2191-5644		978-3-319-29910-5; 978-3-319-29909-9				2016							253	258		10.1007/978-3-319-29910-5_26							WOS:000381977000026

A study of the electromagnetic bias for GNSS-R ocean altimetry using the choppy wave model	WAVES IN RANDOM AND COMPLEX MEDIA												Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) altimetry involves measuring reflections of Global Positioning System transmissions from the Earth's surface (a bistatic radar configuration.) These reflected signals carry information about the Earth's surface, including the sea surface height. The electromagnetic (EM) bias is a significant error source when measuring sea surface height with GNSS-R due to the non-symmetric properties of sea waves. Although previous studies of the EM bias have been conducted for traditional backscatter altimetry, information on the EM bias in the bistatic configurations important for GNSS-R is limited. Of particular interest is the influence of the bistatic geometry on the EM bias. This paper presents a study of the EM bias in GNSS-R altimetry. The study employs a Monte Carlo procedure with numerical nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a physical optics method for EM scattering from the sea surface to produce a deterministic set of sea surface profiles and the corresponding GNSS-R waveforms. In this initial study, choppy wave model is used for nonlinear surface description in order to improve further the computational efficiency and one-dimension surface analysis is chosen for the simple computations. The influence of the bistatic configuration on the EM bias properties has analyzed, and it is shown that the EM bias varies approximately as a cosine function of the incident angle and that short wave effects make important contributions.																	1745-5030	1745-5049					2016	26	4					599	612		10.1080/17455030.2016.1179820							WOS:000382374800014

Characterization of anthropogenic methane plumes with the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES): a retrieval method and error analysis	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												We introduce a retrieval algorithm to estimate lower tropospheric methane (CH4) concentrations from the surface to 1 km with uncertainty estimates using Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) airborne radiance measurements. After resampling, retrievals have a spatial resolution of 6 x 6 m(2). The total error from a single retrieval is approximately 20 %, with the uncertainties determined primarily by noise and spectral interferences from air temperature, surface emissivity, and atmospheric water vapor. We demonstrate retrievals for a HyTES flight line over storage tanks near Kern River Oil Field (KROF), Kern County, California, and find an extended plume structure in the set of observations with elevated methane concentrations (3.0 +/- 0.6 to 6.0 +/- 1.2 ppm), well above mean concentrations (1.8 +/- 0.4 ppm) observed for this scene. With typically a 20% estimated uncertainty, plume enhancements with more than 1 ppm are distinguishable from the background values with its uncertainty. HyTES retrievals are consistent with simultaneous airborne and ground-based in situ CH4 mole fraction measurements within the reported accuracy of approximately 0.2 ppm (or similar to 8 %), due to retrieval interferences related to air temperature, emissivity, and H2O.

In this study, we present a new technique to estimate tropospheric turbulence strength (namely, scintillation index) by analyzing RO amplitude fluctuations in impact parameter domain. GPS RO observations from the COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) satellites enabled us to calculate global maps of scintillation measures, revealing the seasonal, latitudinal, and longitudinal characteristics of the turbulent troposphere. Such information are both difficult and expensive to obtain especially over the oceans. To verify our approach, simulation experiments using the multiple phase screen (MPS) method were conducted. The results show that scintillation indices inferred from the MPS simulations are in good agreement with scintillation measures estimated from COSMIC observations.

These models require prior estimates of CO2 fluxes at relatively high temporal resolutions (e.g., 3-hourly) because of the high frequency of atmospheric mixing and wind heterogeneity. However, land surface model CO2 fluxes are often provided at monthly time steps, typically because the land surface modeling community focuses more on time steps associated with plant phenology (e.g., seasonal) than on sub-daily phenomena. Here, we describe a new dataset created from 15 global land surface models and 4 ensemble products in the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), temporally downscaled from monthly to 3-hourly output. We provide 3-hourly output for each individual model over 7 years (2004-2010), as well as an ensemble mean, a weighted ensemble mean, and the multi-model standard deviation. Output is provided in three different spatial resolutions for user preferences: 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees, 2.0 degrees x 2.5 degrees, and 4.0 degrees x 5.0 degrees (latitude x longitude).

For standoff security screening, a 340 GHz imaging radar now achieves an 8.3 Hz frame, and it has been tested using power-efficient MMIC-based active multiplier sources into its front end. That system evolved from a 680 GHz security radar platform, which has also been modified to operate in a Doppler mode for probing the dynamics of blowing sand and sensing small-amplitude target vibrations. Meanwhile, 95 and 183 GHz radars based on similar RF architectures are currently being developed to probe cometary jets in space and, using a differential absorption technique, humidity inside upper-tropospheric clouds.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0071-3				2016	9830								983005	10.1117/12.2222737							WOS:000381692700003

Specifically, we examine scenarios involving subsurface layers exhibiting electrical response given by deviated anisotropic tensors exhibiting low loss and high inter-layer dielectric contrast (i.e., strong subsurface wave guidance), as well as predominantly cross-pol specular interface scatter (XSIS)-based subsurface backscatter. We hypothesize that this scenario can occur within myriad layered geophysical structures containing media hosting a distribution of sub-wavelength, non-spherical inclusions with mean non-vertical orientation. Guidance-enhanced, XSIS-based backscatter we predict can dominate cross-pol InSAR observations (particularly at lower frequencies such as P-band) concerning these types of structures, leading (in the limit of stronger wave guidance) to rapid, inverse-quadratic degradation of correlation versus InSAR spatial baseline, as well as high and linearly divergent phase bias. Modeling the dominant cross pot backscatter mechanisms adds another tool for Polarimetric InSAR (PoIInSAR) data interpretation and inversion concerning sea ice and other complex layered geophysical structures which can contain media possessing effective anisotropic dielectric response.

A recently-developed incoherent scattering model now allows prediction of InSAR phase bias arising from the radar wave undergoing an (if neglecting radar time-gating) unending succession of subsurface specular reflections ("multi-bounce"), which is crucial for more comprehensively understanding interferometric observations (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial) of many low-loss layered structures. Our paper's results are as follows. First, for increasing subsurface wave attenuation the phase bias approaches zero (backscattering top interface) or the thickness of the subsurface slab (backscatter-free top interface). Second, increasing dielectric contrast between the central and outer two layers elevates (reduces) phase bias for a top interface weakly (strongly) backscattering power relative to the bottom interface. We conclude that subsurface scatter-enhanced phase bias should become significant primarily for geological structures characterized by a weakly-backscattering (i.e., very smooth) top interface and low-attenuating subsurface, which are attributes that may reasonably be used to describe the EM scattering properties of many manifestations of ice, snow, dry soil, and hyper-arid sand or regolith-mantled bedrock structures.

High-temperature turn-on behavior of an nBn infrared detector	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLII	Proceedings of SPIE				42 Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLII	APR 18-21, 2016	Baltimore, MA	SPIE				High-temperature characteristics of a mid-wavelength infrared detector based on the Maimon-Wicks InAsSb/AlAsSb nBn design indicates that the quantum efficiency does not degrade when the operating temperature increases to above room temperature. However, it was also found that the turn-on bias becomes larger at higher temperatures. This counter-intuitive behavior was originally attributed to the change in the band alignment between the absorber and top contact layers due to Fermi level temperature dependence. Recent analysis shows that this is more likely due to temperature-dependent band bending effects. Dark current mechanism is analyzed based on minority carrier lifetime measurements. The difference between the responsivity and absorption quantum efficiencies is clarified.

Precipitation profiling capabilities are currently limited to a few instruments deployed in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which cannot provide the temporal resolution necessary to observe the evolution of short time-scale weather phenomena and improve numerical weather prediction models. A constellation of cloud- and precipitation-profiling instruments in LEO would provide this essential capability, but the cost and timeframe of typical satellite platforms and instruments constitute a possibly prohibitive challenge. A new radar instrument architecture that is compatible with low-cost satellite platforms, such as CubeSats and SmallSats, has been designed at JPL. Its small size, moderate mass and low power requirement enable constellation missions, which will vastly expand our ability to observe weather systems and their dynamics and thermodynamics at sub-diurnal time scales down to the temporal resolutions required to observe developing convection. In turn, this expanded observational ability can revolutionize weather now-casting and medium-range forecasting, and enable crucial model improvements to improve climate predictions.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0117-8				2016	9876								UNSP 987606	10.1117/12.2228188							WOS:000381932000001

The impact of hydrometeors on the microphysical parameterization in the WRF modelling system over Southern Peninsular India	REMOTE SENSING OF THE ATMOSPHERE, CLOUDS, AND PRECIPITATION VI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere, Clouds, and Precipitation VI	APR 04-07, 2016	Indian Soc Remote Sensing, New Delhi, INDIA	SPIE, Indian Space Res Org, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm	Indian Soc Remote Sensing			This study examines the influence of Purdue-Lin microphysical parameterization scheme (Lin et al., 1983) on quantitative precipitation for pre-monsoon/monsoon conditions over southern peninsular India in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. An ideal microphysical scheme has to describe the formation, growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals and fall out as precipitation. Microphysics schemes can be broadly categorized into two types: bin and bulk particle size distribution (Morrison, 2010). Bulk schemes predict one or more bulk quantities and assume some functional form for the particle size distribution. For better parameterization, proper interpretation of these hydrometeors (Cloud Droplets, Raindrops, Ice Crystals and Aggregates, Rimed Ice Particles, Graupel, Hail) and non-hydrometeors (Aerosols vs. Condensation Nuclei vs. Cloud Condensation Nuclei vs. Ice Nuclei) is very important. The Purdue-Lin scheme is a commonly used microphysics scheme in WRF model utilizing the "bulk" particle size distribution, meaning that a particle size distribution is assumed. The intercept parameter (N-0) is, in fact, turns out to be independent of the density. However, in situ observations suggest (Haddad et al., 1996, 1997) that the mass weighted mean diameter is correlated with water content per unit volume (q), leading to the fact that N-0 depends on it. Here, in order to analyze the correlation of droplet size distribution with the convection, we have carried out simulations by implementing a consistent methodology to enforce a correlation between N-0 and q in the Purdue-Lin microphysics scheme in WRF model. The effect of particles in Indian Summer Monsoon has been examined using frequency distribution of rainfall at surface, daily rainfall over the domain and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. The simulations are conducted by analyzing the maximum rainfall days in the pre-monsoon/monsoon seasons using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) accumulated rainfall data for 24 hours.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0117-8				2016	9876								UNSP 98762Q	10.1117/12.2223669							WOS:000381932000049

It supports the construction of correlators for an arbitrarily large number of signals. The ASIC uses an intrinsically low-power architecture along with design techniques and a process that together result in unprecedentedly low power consumption. The design is flexible in that it can support telescopes with almost any number of antennas N. It is intended for use in an "FX" correlator, where a uniform filter bank breaks each signal into separate frequency channels prior to correlation.																			978-1-4673-8678-4				2016																	WOS:000381740500016

With crystalline materials, their use can be extended to the mid-IR beyond 2 mu m where molecular gases not only have very rich characteristic spectral lines but also very large absorption cross sections. In this paper, we describe our continued efforts of pushing whispering gallery mode resonator applications in the mid-IR wavelength region for spectroscopic applications including Kerr comb generation and molecular absorption spectroscopy. With a variety of mid-IR transmitting crystalline materials, we investigate their Q and limiting factors, dispersion and spectral engineering, parametric oscillation and comb generation. We have also explored the utility and limitation of using high Q resonators for ringdown molecular absorption measurements.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-962-7				2016	9727								97270H	10.1117/12.2217032							WOS:000381077500008

Kent			Holographic Microscopy for 3D Tracking of Bacteria	QUANTITATIVE PHASE IMAGING II	Proceedings of SPIE				2nd Confernce on Quantitative Phase Imaging ((QPI II)	FEB 14-17, 2016	San Francisco, CA	SPIE				Understanding when, how, and if bacteria swim is key to understanding critical ecological and biological processes, from carbon cycling to infection. Imaging motility by traditional light microscopy is limited by focus depth, requiring cells to be constrained in z. Holographic microscopy offers an instantaneous 3D snapshot of a large sample volume, and is therefore ideal in principle for quantifying unconstrained bacterial motility. However, resolving and tracking individual cells is difficult due to the low amplitude and phase contrast of the cells; the index of refraction of typical bacteria differs from that of water only at the second decimal place. In this work we present a combination of optical and samplehandling approaches to facilitating bacterial tracking by holographic phase imaging. The first is the design of the microscope, which is an off-axis design with the optics along a common path, which minimizes alignment issues while providing all of the advantages of off-axis holography. Second, we use anti-reflective coated etalon glass in the design of sample chambers, which reduce internal reflections. Improvement seen with the antireflective coating is seen primarily in phase imaging, and its quantification is presented here. Finally, dyes may be used to increase phase contrast according to the Kramers-Kronig relations. Results using three test strains are presented, illustrating the different types of bacterial motility characterized by an enteric organism (Escherichia coli), an environmental organism (Bacillus subtilis), and a marine organism (Vibrio alginolyticus). Data processing steps to increase the quality of the phase images and facilitate tracking are also discussed.

However, a major drawback of a piezoelectric bimorph is its brittle nature in harsh environments, precipitating short life-times as well as output power degradation. The emphasis in this work is to design robust, highly efficient piezoelectric harvesters that are capable of generating electrical power in the milliwatt range. Various harvesters were modeled, designed and prototyped, and the flextensional actuator based harvester, where the metal cantilever is mounted and coupled between two flextensional actuators, was found to be a viable alternative to the cantilever type piezoelectric harvesters. Preliminary tests show that these devices equipped with 5x5x36 mm two piezoelectric PZT stacks can produce greater than 50 mW of power under air flow induced vibrations.

Of the two mission options that have been considered, one involves the capture of an entire near-Earth asteroid in the 10-m class by a robotic spacecraft. The spacecraft would first make contact with the asteroid through a deformable membrane, before securing it inside a large flexible bagging mechanism. In this paper we describe the development and implementation of a model designed for simulation of the capture process, which includes a low-complexity representation of the interaction dynamics.																			978-0-7918-5716-8				2016									V006T10A036								WOS:000380413400036

The SysML provides the means to model requirements, functions, structure and behavior of a system. Integrating a multi body physics simulation with this language creates a seamless way to combine system level questions with the detailed design. The integration allows for the import and export of the simulation models as well as the definition of metrics on the simulation. The system model can be used to express the requirements, the tests that verify the satisfaction and the implementation of the system according to these requirements. Having all the different aspects in one central model reduces the thread of inconsistencies through reuse and linking of model elements. The SysML model allows for an easier creation of large models and the integration with other disciplines is already prepared.																			978-0-7918-5716-8				2016									V006T10A038								WOS:000380413400038

Given kinematic constraints and targets such as desired positions and orientations in Cartesian space, we find locally optimal joint velocities toward the targets at every time step by formulating the problem into a constrained optimization with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints in terms of the joint velocities. The solution is integrated to obtain the joint displacements at the next time step, and this process is repeated until reaching the targets or converging to a certain configuration. Our formulation based on relative Tacobian is particularly useful in handling constraints on relative motions, which arises in many practical problems such as dual-arm manipulation and self-collision avoidance, in a concise manner. A brief overview of our software implementation and its applications to manipulation and mobility planning of a simulated multi limbed robot are also presented.																			978-0-7918-5716-8				2016									V006T10A020								WOS:000380413400020

Analysis of collocated AIRS and MODIS data: a global investigation of correlations between clouds and atmosphere in 2004-2012	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												We used collocated observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) to investigate correlations between cloud parameters and atmospheric stability. We focus on low clouds and specifically investigate the cloud parameters cloud cover and cloud optical thickness from MODIS. The selected atmospheric parameters from AIRS are maximum relative humidity (MRH), lower tropospheric stability (LTS), and water vapour gradient (QTS). The correlations were tested for temporal and regional variation on a global scale and over a time frame of 10 years. Cloud cover and MRH show weak correlations and strong variations on both the temporal and spatial scales. However, cloud cover and lower tropospheric stability show a high correlation in areas with low maritime clouds. The correlation is relatively stable, but slightly increased for the years 2009-2012. Correlations between cloud cover and QTS show a similar behaviour, but slightly stronger variations on the spatial and temporal scales, with better correlations in the East Pacific and from 2004 to 2012. The correlations with cloud optical thickness are weaker in all three cases. A more detailed analysis of the Southeast Pacific shows the influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on most parameters, but a relatively stable behaviour for the connection of cloud fraction and LTS. Based on the analysis, we suggest that relative humidity is an insufficient approach to link atmospheric properties and low cloud cover. However, we find good correlations with respect to LTS and QTS. LTS in particular indicates low temporal fluctuations, even in the case of influence by ENSO.

J	Zhang, K; Fu, R; Wang, T; Liu, YM				Zhang, Kai; Fu, Rong; Wang, Tao; Liu, Yimin			Impact of geographic variations of the convective and dehydration center on stratospheric water vapor over the Asian monsoon region	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Asian monsoon region is the most prominent moisture center of water vapor in the lower stratosphere (LS) during boreal summer. Previous studies have suggested that the transport of water vapor to the Asian monsoon LS is controlled by dehydration temperatures and convection mainly over the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia. However, there is a clear geographic variation of convection associated with the seasonal and intra-seasonal variations of the Asian monsoon circulation, and the relative influence of such a geographic variation of convection vs. the variation of local dehydration temperatures on water vapor transport is still not clear. Using satellite observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and a domain-filling forward trajectory model, we show that almost half of the seasonal water vapor increase in the Asian monsoon LS are attributable to geographic variations of convection and resultant variations of the dehydration center, of which the influence is comparable to the influence of the local dehydration temperature increase. In particular, dehydration temperatures are coldest over the southeast and warmest over the northwest Asian monsoon region. Although the convective center is located over Southeast Asia, an anomalous increase of convection over the northwest Asia monsoon region increases local diabatic heating in the tropopause layer and air masses entering the LS are dehydrated at relatively warmer temperatures. Due to warmer dehydration temperatures, anomalously moist air enters the LS and moves eastward along the northern flank of the monsoon anticyclonic flow, leading to wet anomalies in the LS over the Asian monsoon region. Likewise, when convection increases over the Southeast Asia monsoon region, dry anomalies appear in the LS. On a seasonal scale, this feature is associated with the monsoon circulation, convection and diabatic heating marching towards the northwest Asia monsoon region from June to August. The march of convection leads to an increasing fraction of the air mass to be dehydrated at warmer temperatures over the northwest Asia monsoon region. Work presented here confirms the dominant role of temperatures on water vapor variations and emphasizes that further studies should take geographic variations of the dehydration center into consideration when studying water vapor variations in the LS as it is linked to changes of convection and large-scale circulation patterns.

With more than 15 years (2000 to present) of validated multispectral observations, MOPITT provides the unique capability to separate CO in the lowermost troposphere (LMT, surface to 3 km (similar to 700 hPa)) from the free-tropospheric abundance. To extend this record, a new, hyper-spectral approach is presented here that will provide CO data products exceeding the capabilities of MOPITT by combining the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR, equivalent to the MOPITT NIR) channels from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to be launched aboard the European Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5p) satellite in 2016 and the TIR channels from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. We apply the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, Multi-SEnsors (MUSES) retrieval algorithm to quantify the potential of this joint CO product. CO profiles are retrieved from a single-footprint, full-spectral-resolution CrIS transect over Africa on 27-28 August 2013 coincident with significant biomass burning. Comparisons of collocated CrIS and MOPITT CO observations for the LMT show a mean difference of 2.8 +/- 24.9 ppb, which is well within the estimated measurement uncertainty of both sensors. The estimated degrees of freedom (DOF) for CO signals from synergistic CrIS-TROPOMI retrievals are approximately 0.9 in the LMT and 1.3 above the LMT, which indicates that the LMT CO can be distinguished from the free troposphere, similar to MOPITT multispectral observations (0.8 in the LMT, and 1.1 above the LMT). In addition to increased sensitivity, the combined retrievals reduce measurement uncertainty, with similar to 15% error reduction in the LMT. With a daily global coverage and a combined spatial footprint of 14 km, the joint CrIS-TROPOMI measurements have the potential to extend and improve upon the MOPITT multispectral CO data records for the coming decade.

J	Millan, L; Lebsock, M; Livesey, N; Tanelli, S				Millan, Luis; Lebsock, Matthew; Livesey, Nathaniel; Tanelli, Simone			Differential absorption radar techniques: water vapor retrievals	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Two radar pulses sent at different frequencies near the 183 GHz water vapor line can be used to determine total column water vapor and water vapor profiles (within clouds or precipitation) exploiting the differential absorption on and off the line. We assess these water vapor measurements by applying a radar instrument simulator to CloudSat pixels and then running end-to-end retrieval simulations. These end-to-end retrievals enable us to fully characterize not only the expected precision but also their potential biases, allowing us to select radar tones that maximize the water vapor signal minimizing potential errors due to spectral variations in the target extinction properties. A hypothetical CloudSat-like instrument with 500m by similar to 1 km vertical and horizontal resolution and a minimum detectable signal and radar precision of -30 and 0.16 dBZ, respectively, can estimate total column water vapor with an expected precision of around 0.03 cm, with potential biases smaller than 0.26 cm most of the time, even under rainy conditions. The expected precision for water vapor profiles was found to be around 89% on average, with potential biases smaller than 77% most of the time when the profile is being retrieved close to surface but smaller than 38% above 3 km. By using either horizontal or vertical averaging, the precision will improve vastly, with the measurements still retaining a considerably high vertical and/or horizontal resolution.

Joint retrieval of aerosol and water-leaving radiance from multispectral, multiangular and polarimetric measurements over ocean	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												An optimization approach has been developed for simultaneous retrieval of aerosol properties and normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) from multispectral, multiangular, and polarimetric observations over ocean. The main features of the method are (1) use of a simplified bio-optical model to estimate nLw, followed by an empirical refinement within a specified range to improve its accuracy; (2) improved algorithm convergence and stability by applying constraints on the spatial smoothness of aerosol loading and Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration across neighboring image patches and spectral constraints on aerosol optical properties and nLw across relevant bands; and (3) enhanced Jacobian calculation by modeling and storing the radiative transfer (RT) in aerosol/Rayleigh mixed layer, pure Rayleigh-scattering layers, and ocean medium separately, then coupling them to calculate the field at the sensor. This approach avoids unnecessary and time-consuming recalculations of RT in unperturbed layers in Jacobian evaluations. The Markov chain method is used to model RT in the aerosol/Rayleigh mixed layer and the doubling method is used for the uniform layers of the atmosphere-ocean system. Our optimization approach has been tested using radiance and polarization measurements acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) over the AERONET USC_SeaPRISM ocean site (6 February 2013) and near the AERONET La Jolla site (14 January 2013), which, respectively, reported relatively high and low aerosol loadings. Validation of the results is achieved through comparisons to AERONET aerosol and ocean color products. For comparison, the USC_SeaPRISM retrieval is also performed by use of the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties algorithm (Dubovik et al., 2011). Uncertainties of aerosol and nLw retrievals due to random and systematic instrument errors are analyzed by truth-in/truth-out tests with three Chl a concentrations, five aerosol loadings, three different types of aerosols, and nine combinations of solar incidence and viewing geometries.

Case study of spatial and temporal variability of snow cover, grain size, albedo and radiative forcing in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountain snowpack derived from imaging spectroscopy	CRYOSPHERE												Quantifying the spatial distribution and temporal change in mountain snow cover, microphysical and optical properties is important to improve our understanding of the local energy balance and the related snowmelt and hydrological processes. In this paper, we analyze changes of snow cover, optical-equivalent snow grain size (radius), snow albedo and radiative forcing by light-absorbing impurities in snow and ice (LAISI) with respect to terrain elevation and aspect at multiple dates during the snowmelt period. These snow properties are derived from the NASA/JPL Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data from 2009 in California's Sierra Nevada and from 2011 in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, USA. Our results show a linearly decreasing snow cover during the ablation period in May and June in the Rocky Mountains and a snowfall-driven change in snow cover in the Sierra Nevada between February and May. At the same time, the snow grain size is increasing primarily at higher elevations and north-facing slopes from 200 microns to 800 microns on average. We find that intense snowmelt renders the mean grain size almost invariant with respect to elevation and aspect. Our results confirm the inverse relationship between snow albedo and grain size, as well as between snow albedo and radiative forcing by LAISI. At both study sites, the mean snow albedo value decreases from approximately 0.7 to 0.5 during the ablation period. The mean snow grain size increased from approximately 150 to 650 microns. The mean radiative forcing increases from 20aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) up to 200aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) during the ablation period. The variability of snow albedo and grain size decreases in general with the progression of the ablation period. The spatial variability of the snow albedo and grain size decreases through the melt season while the spatial variability of radiative forcing remains constant.

While several studies have examined recent trends in GrIS mass loss, studies focusing on mass variations at sub-annual and sub-basin-wide scales are still lacking. At these scales, processes responsible for mass change are less well understood and modeled, and could potentially play an important role in future GrIS mass change. Here, we examine spatiotemporal variations in mass over the GrIS derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites for the January 2003-December 2012 period using a 'mascon' approach, with a nominal spatial resolution of 100-km, and a temporal resolution of 10 days. We compare GRACE-estimated mass variations against those simulated by the ModSle Atmosph,rique R,gionale (MAR) RCM and the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). In order to properly compare spatial and temporal variations in GrIS mass from GRACE with model outputs, we find it necessary to spatially and temporally filter model results to reproduce leakage of mass inherent in the GRACE solution. Both modeled and satellite-derived results point to a decline (of -178.9-+/--4.4 and -239.4-+/--7.7-Gt-yr(-1) respectively) in GrIS mass over the period examined, but the models appear to underestimate the rate of mass loss, especially in areas below 2000-m in elevation, where the majority of recent GrIS mass loss is occurring. On an ice-sheet-wide scale, the timing of the modeled seasonal cycle of cumulative mass (driven by summer mass loss) agrees with the GRACE-derived seasonal cycle, within limits of uncertainty from the GRACE solution. However, on sub-ice-sheet-wide scales, some areas exhibit significant differences in the timing of peaks in the annual cycle of mass change. At these scales, model biases, or processes not accounted for by models related to ice dynamics or hydrology, may lead to the observed differences. This highlights the need for further evaluation of modeled processes at regional and seasonal scales, and further study of ice sheet processes not accounted for, such as the role of subglacial hydrology in variations in glacial flow.

We first describe in detail our architecture and methodology for enabling SDV to operate in the Microsoft Azure cloud. We then present our results of using CloudSDV on single drivers and driver suites using various configurations of the cloud relative to a local machine. Our experiments show that using the cloud, we are able to achieve speedups in excess of 20x, which has enabled us to perform mass scale verification in a matter of hours as opposed to days. Finally, we present a brief discussion about our results and experiences.																	0302-9743	1611-3349	978-3-319-33693-0; 978-3-319-33692-3				2016	9681						523	536		10.1007/978-3-319-33693-0_33							WOS:000379291800033

DARDAR profiles are a joint retrieval of CloudSat-CALIPSO data. Analysis is performed for 12 separate regions over land and ocean, and carried out applying MODIS AOD fields that attempt to correct for 3-D cloud adjacency effects. The 3-D cloud adjacency effects have a small impact upon our particular calculations of aerosol-cloud indirect effects. IWC profiles are averaged for three AOD bins individually for the 12 regions. The IWC average profiles are also normalized to unity at 5aEuro-km altitude in order to study changes in the shape of the average IWC profiles as AOD increases. Derivatives of the IWC average profiles, and derivatives of the IWC shape profiles, in percent change per 0.1 change in MODIS AOD units, are calculated separately for each region. Means of altitude-specific probability distribution functions, which include both ocean and land IWC shape regional derivatives, are modest, near 5aEuro-%, and positive to the 2 sigma level between 11 and 15aEuro-km altitude. Similar analyses are carried out for three AAOD and three CO bins. On average, the vertical profiles of the means of the derivatives based upon the profile shapes over land and ocean are smaller for the profiles binned according to AAOD and CO values, than for the MODIS AODs, which include both scattering and absorptive aerosol. This difference in character supports the assertion that absorptive aerosol can inhibit cloud development.

Constraints on methane emissions in North America from future geostationary remote-sensing measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The success of future geostationary (GEO) satellite observation missions depends on our ability to design instruments that address their key scientific objectives. In this study, an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) is performed to quantify the constraints on methane (CH4) emissions in North America obtained from shortwave infrared (SWIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and multi-spectral (SWIR+TIR) measurements in geostationary orbit and from future SWIR low-Earth orbit (LEO) measurements. An efficient stochastic algorithm is used to compute the information content of the inverted emissions at high spatial resolution (0.5A degrees aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-0.7A degrees) in a variational framework using the GEOS-Chem chemistry-transport model and its adjoint. Our results show that at sub-weekly timescales, SWIR measurements in GEO orbit can constrain about twice as many independent flux patterns than in LEO orbit, with a degree of freedom for signal (DOF) for the inversion of 266 and 115, respectively. Comparisons between TIR GEO and SWIR LEO configurations reveal that poor boundary layer sensitivities for the TIR measurements cannot be compensated for by the high spatiotemporal sampling of a GEO orbit. The benefit of a multi-spectral instrument compared to current SWIR products in a GEO context is shown for sub-weekly timescale constraints, with an increase in the DOF of about 50aEuro-% for a 3-day inversion. Our results further suggest that both the SWIR and multi-spectral measurements on GEO orbits could almost fully resolve CH4 fluxes at a spatial resolution of at least 100aEuro-kmaEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-100aEuro-km over source hotspots (emissions > aEuro-4aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-10(5)aEuro-kgaEuro-day(-1)). The sensitivity of the optimized emission scaling factors to typical errors in boundary and initial conditions can reach 30 and 50aEuro-% for the SWIR GEO or SWIR LEO configurations, respectively, while it is smaller than 5aEuro-% in the case of a multi-spectral GEO system. Overall, our results demonstrate that multi-spectral measurements from a geostationary satellite platform would address the need for higher spatiotemporal constraints on CH4 emissions while greatly mitigating the impact of inherent uncertainties in source inversion methods on the inferred fluxes.

Impacts of anthropogenic and natural sources on free tropospheric ozone over the Middle East	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Significant progress has been made in identifying the influence of different processes and emissions on the summertime enhancements of free tropospheric ozone (O-3) at northern midlatitude regions. However, the exact contribution of regional emissions, chemical and transport processes to these summertime enhancements is still not well quantified. Here we focus on quantifying the influence of regional emissions on the summertime O-3 enhancements over the Middle East, using updated reactive nitrogen (NOx) emissions. We then use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem model with these updated NOx emissions to show that the global total contribution of lightning NOx on middle free tropospheric O-3 over the Middle East is about 2 times larger than that from global anthropogenic sources. The summertime middle free tropospheric O-3 enhancement is primarily due to Asian NOx emissions, with approximately equivalent contributions from Asian anthropogenic activities and lightning. In the Middle Eastern lower free troposphere, lightning NOx from Europe and North America and anthropogenic NOx from Middle Eastern local emissions are the primary sources of O-3. This work highlights the critical role of lightning NOx on northern midlatitude free tropospheric O-3 and the important effect of the Asian summer monsoon on the export of Asian pollutants.

Climatology of the aerosol optical depth by components from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and chemistry transport models	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Joint Aerosol (JOINT_AS) Level 3 product has provided a global, descriptive summary of MISR Level 2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol type information for each month over 16+aEuro-years since March 2000. Using Version 1 of JOINT_AS, which is based on the operational (Version 22) MISR Level 2 aerosol product, this study analyzes, for the first time, characteristics of observed and simulated distributions of AOD for three broad classes of aerosols: spherical nonabsorbing, spherical absorbing, and nonspherical - near or downwind of their major source regions. The statistical moments (means, standard deviations, and skewnesses) and distributions of AOD by components derived from the JOINT_AS are compared with results from two chemistry transport models (CTMs), the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) and SPectral RadIatioN-TrAnSport (SPRINTARS). Overall, the AOD distributions retrieved from MISR and modeled by GOCART and SPRINTARS agree with each other in a qualitative sense. Marginal distributions of AOD for each aerosol type in both MISR and models show considerable high positive skewness, which indicates the importance of including extreme AOD events when comparing satellite retrievals with models. The MISR JOINT_AS product will greatly facilitate comparisons between satellite observations and model simulations of aerosols by type.

Measurements from Sondeur Atmosph,rique du Profil d'Humidit, Intertropicale par Radiom,trie (SAPHIR) onboard the low inclination Megha-Tropiques satellite with frequent daily revisits provide a valuable dataset for investigating the diurnal and spatial variation of tropospheric relative humidity in the tropical region. In this study, we first transformed SAPHIR observations into layer-averaged relative humidity, then partitioned the data based on local observation time into 24 bins with a grid resolution of one degree. Afterwards, we fitted Fourier series to the binned data. Finally, the mean, amplitude, and diurnal peak time of relative humidity in tropical regions were calculated for each grid point using either the measurements or Fourier series. The results were separately investigated for different SAPHIR channels as well as for relative humidity with respect to both liquid and ice phases. The results showed that the wet and dry regions are, respectively, associated with convective and subsidence regions which is consistent with the previous studies. The mean tropospheric humidity values reported in this study are generally 10 to 15aEuro-% higher than those reported using infrared observations which is because of strict cloud screening for infrared measurements. The results showed a large inhomogeneity in diurnal variation of tropospheric relative humidity in tropical region. The diurnal amplitude was larger over land than over ocean and the oceanic amplitude was larger over convective regions than over subsidence regions. The results showed that the diurnal amplitude is less than 10aEuro-% in middle and upper troposphere, but it is up to 30aEuro-% in lower troposphere over land. Although the peak of RH generally occurs over night or in early morning, there are several regions where the diurnal peak occurs at other times of the day. The early morning peak time is because of a peak in convective activities in early morning. Additionally, a double peak was observed in tropospheric humidity over some regions which is consistent with double peak in precipitation.

During and in support of this campaign, five lidar ground-based stations (Athens, Barcelona, Bucharest, A parts per thousand vora, and Granada) performed 72aEuro-h of continuous lidar measurements and collocated and coincident sun-photometer measurements. Therefore it was possible to retrieve volume concentration profiles with the Lidar Radiometer Inversion Code (LIRIC). Results indicated the presence of a mineral dust plume affecting the western Mediterranean region (mainly the Granada station), whereas a different aerosol plume was observed over the Balkans area. LIRIC profiles showed a predominance of coarse spheroid particles above Granada, as expected for mineral dust, and an aerosol plume composed mainly of fine and coarse spherical particles above Athens and Bucharest. Due to the exceptional characteristics of the ChArMEx database, the analysis of the microphysical properties profiles' temporal evolution was also possible. An in-depth analysis was performed mainly at the Granada station because of the availability of continuous lidar measurements and frequent AERONET inversion retrievals. The analysis at Granada was of special interest since the station was affected by mineral dust during the complete analyzed period. LIRIC was found to be a very useful tool for performing continuous monitoring of mineral dust, allowing for the analysis of the dynamics of the dust event in the vertical and temporal coordinates. Results obtained here illustrate the importance of having collocated and simultaneous advanced lidar and sun-photometer measurements in order to characterize the aerosol microphysical properties in both the vertical and temporal coordinates at a regional scale. In addition, this study revealed that the use of the depolarization information as input in LIRIC in the stations of Bucharest, A parts per thousand vora, and Granada was crucial for the characterization of the aerosol types and their distribution in the vertical column, whereas in stations lacking depolarization lidar channels, ancillary information was needed. Results obtained were also used for the validation of different mineral dust models. In general, the models better forecast the vertical distribution of the mineral dust than the column-integrated mass concentration, which was underestimated in most of the cases.				, Guerrero-Rascado/K-3631-2013; Kokkalis, Panagiotis/I-8531-2014; Nepomuceno Pereira, Sergio/B-2042-2017; Rodriguez-Gomez, Alejandro/F-7094-2013; Guzman, Francisco Navas/G-5900-2016; Reyes, Francisco Jose Olmo/F-7621-2016; Dulac, FranAois/AAD-6573-2019; Aranda, Juan Antonio Bravo/AAL-4939-2020; Nicolae, Doina/I-4999-2016; Dubovik, Oleg/AAB-9089-2020; Comeron, Adolfo/M-5507-2013; Schepanski, Kerstin/I-7967-2015; Alados-Arboledas, Lucas/P-5630-2014; Bravo-Aranda, Juan/A-7368-2019; Baldasano, Jose M./A-3852-2016; Belegante, Livio/B-5812-2012; Munoz-Porcar, Constantino/F-8165-2013; Dubovik, Oleg/A-8235-2009; Granados Munoz, Maria Jose/G-9308-2014; Binietoglou, Ioannis/B-7976-2016	, Guerrero-Rascado/0000-0002-8317-2304; Kokkalis, Panagiotis/0000-0001-5231-5491; Nepomuceno Pereira, Sergio/0000-0002-3727-8183; Rodriguez-Gomez, Alejandro/0000-0002-9209-0685; Guzman, Francisco Navas/0000-0002-0905-4385; Reyes, Francisco Jose Olmo/0000-0002-0186-1721; Aranda, Juan Antonio Bravo/0000-0002-2236-5241; Comeron, Adolfo/0000-0001-6886-3679; Schepanski, Kerstin/0000-0002-1027-6786; Alados-Arboledas, Lucas/0000-0003-3576-7167; Bravo-Aranda, Juan/0000-0002-2236-5241; Baldasano, Jose M./0000-0002-6191-635X; Munoz-Porcar, Constantino/0000-0002-6543-119X; Dubovik, Oleg/0000-0003-3482-6460; Basart, Sara/0000-0002-9821-8504; Granados Munoz, Maria Jose/0000-0001-8718-5914; Binietoglou, Ioannis/0000-0002-0065-9791												1680-7316	1680-7324					2016	16	11					7043	7066		10.5194/acp-16-7043-2016							WOS:000378354600024

Strong magnetic field and dense plasma environment induce Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized fraction of the spacecraft radio carrier signal. Variations in the Faraday rotation signify changes in magnetic field components and plasma parameters, and thus can be used to gain understanding processes of the quiescent sun as well as active outbursts including coronal mass ejections. Our 2015 observing campaign resulted in a series of measurements over several months with the 100m Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to investigate the coronal Faraday rotation at various radial distances. These observations reveal notable fluctuations in the Faraday rotation of the signal in the deep corona, and should yield unique insights into coronal magnetohydrodynamics down to a 1.5 solar radius line-of-sight solar elongation.																			978-1-58381-892-3				2016	504						99	102									WOS:000378098700016

The laser heterostmctures consist of two GaInAsSb quantum well stages in series separated by GaSb/AlSb/InAs tunnel junction and InAs/AlSb electron injectors. Single-mode emission is generated using second order lateral Bragg grating etched alongside narrow ridge waveguides. The lasers were fabricated into 2-mm-long devices, solder-mounted epi-up on copper submounts, and operate at room temperature. With an anti-reflection coating at the emission facet, the lasers exhibit a typical current threshold of 110 mA at 20 degrees C and emit more than 14 mW of output power. The Bragg wavelength temperature tuning rate was 0.29 nm/degrees C.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0002-7				2016	9767								97670U	10.1117/12.2213224							WOS:000378312100018

He also had a lifelong interest in astronomy, and in the later portion of his remarkable and long career devoted himself to astronomical research, pioneering the study of molecules in interstellar space and the development of infrared spectroscopy, first from the ground and then from airborne facilities. His interest in high angular resolution, as well as high spectral resolution observations, led to development of the first infrared spatial interferometer employing coherent signal processing techniques. In this short review I will only touch on some of Townes' many scientific contributions, concentrating on astronomy, and will also give some personal thoughts about how he inspired students in their research, helping to make the "Townes Group" at the University of California, Berkeley, an ideal environment in which to start a career in research.																	1633-4760		978-2-7598-2022-1				2016	75-76						7	17		10.1051/eas/1575002							WOS:000377836300001

High spatial resolution imaging of methane and other trace gases with the airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Currently large uncertainties exist associated with the attribution and quantification of fugitive emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases such as methane across large regions and key economic sectors. In this study, data from the airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) have been used to develop robust and reliable techniques for the detection and wide-area mapping of emission plumes of methane and other atmospheric trace gas species over challenging and diverse environmental conditions with high spatial resolution that permits direct attribution to sources. HyTES is a pushbroom imaging spectrometer with high spectral resolution (256 bands from 7.5 to 12 mu m), wide swath (1-2 km), and high spatial resolution (similar to 2m at 1 km altitude) that incorporates new thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing technologies. In this study we introduce a hybrid clutter matched filter (CMF) and plume dilation algorithm applied to HyTES observations to efficiently detect and characterize the spatial structures of individual plumes of CH4, H2S, NH3, NO2, and SO2 emitters. The sensitivity and field of regard of HyTES allows rapid and frequent airborne surveys of large areas including facilities not readily accessible from the surface. The HyTES CMF algorithm produces plume intensity images of methane and other gases from strong emission sources. The combination of high spatial resolution and multi-species imaging capability provides source attribution in complex environments. The CMF-based detection of strong emission sources over large areas is a fast and powerful tool needed to focus on more computationally intensive retrieval algorithms to quantify emissions with error estimates, and is useful for expediting mitigation efforts and addressing critical science questions.

Architectural and Operational Considerations Emerging from Hybrid RF-Optical Network Loading Simulations	FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATION AND ATMOSPHERIC PROPAGATION XXVIII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Free-Space Laser Communication and Atmospheric Propagation XXVIII	FEB 15-16, 2016	San Francisco, CA	SPIE				A technology demonstration of free space optical communication at interplanetary distances is planned via one or more future NASA deep-space missions. Such demonstrations will "pave the way" for operational use of optical communications on future robotic/potential Human missions. Hence, the Deep Space Network architecture will need to evolve. Preliminary attempts to model the anticipated future mission set and simulate how well it loads onto assumed architectures with combinations of RF and optical apertures have been evaluated. This paper discusses the results of preliminary loading simulations for hybrid RF-optical network architectures and highlights key mission and ground infrastructure considerations that emerge.																	0277-786X		978-1-62841-974-0				2016	9739								97390P	10.1117/12.2213594							WOS:000377708200022

In this paper, we discuss concepts and algorithms for uplink signal acquisition, tracking, and parameter estimation using a photon-counting camera. Statistical models of detector output data and signal processing algorithms are presented, incorporating realistic effects such as Earth background and detector/readout blocking. Analysis and simulation results are validated against measured laboratory data using state-of-the-art commercial photon-counting detector arrays, demonstrating sub-microradian tracking errors under channel conditions representative of deep space optical links.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-62841-974-0				2016	9739								97390X	10.1117/12.2217971							WOS:000377708200030

A large area (200 mu m diameter) free space coupled avalanche photodiode (APD) detector was used to receive video and a bit patterns at 50 Mb/s. We report on a recent experiment that used an adaptive optics system at OCTL to correct for atmospherically-induced refractive index fluctuations so that the downlink from the ISS could be coupled into a single mode fiber receiver. Stable fiber coupled power was achieved over an entire pass using a self-referencing interferometer based adaptive optics system that was provided and operated by Boeing Co. and integrated to OCTL. End-to-end transmission and reconstruction of an HD video signal verified the communication performance as in the original OPALS demonstration. Coupling the signal into a single mode fiber opens the possibility for higher bandwidth and efficiency modulation schemes and serves as a pilot experiment for future implementations.

Evidence for variable grounding-zone and shear-margin basal conditions across Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica	GEOPHYSICS												Definitive interpretation of ice-sheet basal conditions from radar-sounding data beneath outlet-glacier grounding zones and shear margins can be problematic due to poorly constrained and spatially variable englacial attenuation rates and losses from propagation through a rough ice surface. To correct for spatially variable attenuation rates, we developed a novel radar analysis approach that provided improved empirical attenuation correction by fitting linearly variable attenuation rates along radar-sounding profiles from the ice-sheet interior to the grounding zone. We also corrected for ice-surface propagation losses by using surface echo amplitude distributions to constrain the loss of coherent power for surface reflections and two-way propagation through a rough ice surface. By applying this approach to airborne radar-sounding observations of the Thwaites Glacier catchment in West Antarctica, we produced relative reflectivity profiles, which show grounding-zone basal conditions varying across the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Additionally, these techniques provided improved characterization of basal conditions across shear margins, showing that-contrary to previous interpretations-the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier corresponded to a change in basal conditions consistent with a transition from frozen to thawed bed.

Today algorithms are tested on data gathered in the lab or at best in a few places, and almost always by the people that designed the algorithm. In this paper, we present the first RGB-D dataset from the crowdsourced data collection project Kinect@Home and perform an initial analysis of it. The dataset contains 54 recordings with a total of approximately 45 min of RGB-D video. We present a comparison of two different pose estimation methods, the Kinfu algorithm and a key point-based method, to show how this dataset can be used even though it is lacking ground truth. In addition, the analysis highlights the different characteristics and error modes of the two methods and shows how challenging data from the real world is.																	2194-5357		978-3-319-08338-4; 978-3-319-08337-7				2016	302						843	858		10.1007/978-3-319-08338-4_61							WOS:000377956900061

Design, Control, and Experimentation of Internally-Actuated Rovers for the Exploration of Low-Gravity Planetary Bodies	FIELD AND SERVICE ROBOTICS: RESULTS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE	Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics				10th International Conference on Field and Service Robotics (FSR)	JUN 23-26, 2015	Toronto, CANADA	Clearpath Robot, Univ Toronto, Inst Aerosp Studies, Fac Appl Sci & Engn				In this paper we discuss the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The actuation of the rover relies on spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling the flywheels' spin rates, the rover is capable of achieving large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing orientation relative to the ground. We discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel design and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). The theoretical analysis is validated on a first-of-a-kind 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) microgravity test bed, which consists of a 3 DoF gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane.																	1610-7438		978-3-319-27702-8; 978-3-319-27700-4				2016	113						283	298		10.1007/978-3-319-27702-8_19							WOS:000377201600019

The WACMOS-ET project - Part 2: Evaluation of global terrestrial evaporation data sets	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project aims to advance the development of land evaporation estimates on global and regional scales. Its main objective is the derivation, validation, and intercomparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman-Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets, and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss, and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2016) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers and include in the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results indicate that the Priestley and Taylor products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform best overall for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three evaporation products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency in PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared to surface water balances from 837 globally distributed catchments and to separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the model tree ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, suggests that caution is necessary in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Nevertheless, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.

A 520-620-GHz Schottky Receiver Front-End for Planetary Science and Remote Sensing With 1070 K-1500 K DSB Noise Temperature at Room Temperature	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TERAHERTZ SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					26th International Symposium on Space Terahertz Technology (ISSTT)	MAR 16-18, 2015	Smithsonian Astrophys Observ, Cambridge, MA	Harvard Coll Observ	Smithsonian Astrophys Observ			A state-of-the-art 520-620-GHz receiver front end working at room temperature was designed, built, and measured. The receiver front-end features a GaAs-Schottky diode-based subharmonic mixer and a 260-307-GHz doubler, both fabricated with the new LERMA-LPN Schottky process on a 4-mu m-thick GaAs membrane suspended in a waveguide with metal beamleads. Small-area mesas and optimized transmission lines with low dielectric loading are used. At 295 K ambient temperature, an average of 1284 K DSB receiver noise temperature was measured over the 520-620-GHz frequency range, including the 3.5-8.5-GHz IF chain loss. A record 1130 K minimum DSB receiver noise temperature at 557 GHz was measured. At 134 K ambient temperature, an average DSB receiver noise temperature of 685 K from 538 to 600 GHz was measured when correcting for the cryostat window loss. A minimum DSB receiver noise of 585 K was measured at an RF center frequency of 540 GHz. The 520-620-GHz receiver presented in this article allows an increase in the sensitivity of the JUpiter ICy Moons Explrorer-SWI instrument of about a factor of two compared with requirements. It will allow study of the Jovian system with particular emphasis on the chemistry, meteorology, structure, and atmospheric coupling processes of Jupiter and its icy satellites, thereby providing important data for the exploration of their habitable zones.

Cometary Science with the James Webb Space Telescope	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC												The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as the largest space-based astronomical observatory with near-and mid-infrared instrumentation, will elucidate many mysterious aspects of comets. We summarize four cometary science themes especially suited for this telescope and its instrumentation: the drivers of cometary activity, comet nucleus heterogeneity, water ice in comae and on surfaces, and activity in faint comets and main belt asteroids. With JWST, we can expect the most distant detections of gas, especially CO2, in what we now consider to be only moderately bright comets. For nearby comets, coma dust properties can be simultaneously studied with their driving gases, measured simultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another. Studies of water ice and gas in the distant Solar System will help us test our understanding of cometary interiors, and coma evolution. The question of cometary activity in main belt comets will be further explored with the possibility of a direct detection of coma gas. We explore the technical approaches to these science cases and provide simple tools for estimating comet dust and gas brightness. Finally, we consider the effects of the observatory's non-sidereal tracking limits and provide a list of potential comet targets during the first five years of the mission.

We find that approximately 75% of NEOs can be observed in a given year. However, observers will need to wait for appropriate observing windows. We find that JWST can easily execute photometric observations of meter-sized NEOs that will enhance our understanding of the small NEO population.

Evaluation of UTLS carbon monoxide simulations in GMI and GEOS-Chem chemical transport models using Aura MLS observations	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study evaluates the distribution and variation of carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) during 2004-2012 as simulated by two chemical transport models, using the latest version of Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations. The simulated spatial distributions, temporal variations and vertical transport of CO in the UTLS region are compared with those observed by MLS. We also investigate the impact of surface emissions and deep convection on CO concentrations in the UTLS over different regions, using both model simulations and MLS observations. Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) and GEOS-Chem simulations of UTLS CO both show similar spatial distributions to observations. The global mean CO values simulated by both models agree with MLS observations at 215 and 147aEuro-hPa, but are significantly underestimated by more than 40aEuro-% at 100aEuro-hPa. In addition, the models underestimate the peak CO values by up to 70aEuro-% at 100aEuro-hPa, 60aEuro-% at 147aEuro-hPa and 40aEuro-% at 215aEuro-hPa, with GEOS-Chem generally simulating more CO at 100aEuro-hPa and less CO at 215aEuro-hPa than GMI. The seasonal distributions of CO simulated by both models are in better agreement with MLS in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), with disagreements between model and observations over enhanced CO regions such as southern Africa. The simulated vertical transport of CO shows better agreement with MLS in the tropics and the SH subtropics than the NH subtropics. We also examine regional variations in the relationships among surface CO emission, convection and UTLS CO concentrations. The two models exhibit emission-convection-CO relationships similar to those observed by MLS over the tropics and some regions with enhanced UTLS CO.

Integration of nitrogen dynamics into the Noah-MP land surface model v1.1 for climate and environmental predictions	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Climate and terrestrial biosphere models consider nitrogen an important factor in limiting plant carbon uptake, while operational environmental models view nitrogen as the leading pollutant causing eutrophication in water bodies. The community Noah land surface model with multi-parameterization options (Noah-MP) is unique in that it is the next-generation land surface model for the Weather Research and Forecasting meteorological model and for the operational weather/climate models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. In this study, we add a capability to Noah-MP to simulate nitrogen dynamics by coupling the Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen (FUN) plant model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) soil nitrogen dynamics. This model development incorporates FUN's state-of-the-art concept of carbon cost theory and SWAT's strength in representing the impacts of agricultural management on the nitrogen cycle. Parameterizations for direct root and mycorrhizal-associated nitrogen uptake, leaf retranslocation, and symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation are employed from FUN, while parameterizations for nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, immobilization, volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching are based on SWAT. The coupled model is then evaluated at the Kellogg Biological Station - a Long Term Ecological Research site within the US Corn Belt. Results show that the model performs well in capturing the major nitrogen state/flux variables (e.g., soil nitrate and nitrate leaching). Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen dynamics improves the modeling of net primary productivity and evapotranspiration. The model improvement is expected to advance the capability of Noah-MP to simultaneously predict weather and water quality in fully coupled Earth system models.

A global scale mechanistic model of photosynthetic capacity (LUNA V1.0)	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Although plant photosynthetic capacity as determined by the maximum carboxylation rate (i.e., V-c,V-max25) and the maximum electron transport rate (i. e., J(max25)) at a reference temperature (generally 25 degrees C) is known to vary considerably in space and time in response to environmental conditions, it is typically parameterized in Earth system models (ESMs) with tabulated values associated with plant functional types. In this study, we have developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA) to predict photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions. We adopt an optimality hypothesis to nitrogen allocation among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation and respiration. The LUNA model is able to reasonably capture the measured spatial and temporal patterns of photosynthetic capacity as it explains similar to 55% of the global variation in observed values of V-c,V-max25 and similar to 65% of the variation in the observed values of J(max25). Model simulations with LUNA under current and future climate conditions demonstrate that modeled values of V-c,V-max25 are most affected in high-latitude regions under future climates. ESMs that relate the values of V-c,V-max25 or J(max25) to plant functional types only are likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.				fisher, rosie/Y-4226-2019; Fisher, Rosie A/E-7746-2013; Rogers, Alistair/P-6185-2019; Wullschleger, Stan/B-8297-2012; Rogers, Alistair/E-1177-2011; Massoud, Elias/AAC-8506-2019	fisher, rosie/0000-0003-3260-9227; Rogers, Alistair/0000-0001-9262-7430; Wullschleger, Stan/0000-0002-9869-0446; Rogers, Alistair/0000-0001-9262-7430; Massoud, Elias/0000-0002-1772-5361; Ali, Ashehad/0000-0002-7328-306X; Xu, Chonggang/0000-0002-0937-5744; Fisher, Joshua/0000-0003-4734-9085; Reich, Peter/0000-0003-4424-662X												1991-959X	1991-9603					2016	9	2					587	606		10.5194/gmd-9-587-2016							WOS:000376933700007						
J	Adhikari, S; Ivins, ER; Larour, E				Adhikari, Surendra; Ivins, Erik R.; Larour, Eric			ISSM-SESAWv1.0: mesh-based computation of gravitationally consistent sea-level and geodetic signatures caused by cryosphere and climate driven mass change	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												A classical Green's function approach for computing gravitationally consistent sea-level variations associated with mass redistribution on the earth's surface employed in contemporary sea-level models naturally suits the spectral methods for numerical evaluation. The capability of these methods to resolve high wave number features such as small glaciers is limited by the need for large numbers of pixels and high-degree (associated Legendre) series truncation. Incorporating a spectral model into (components of) earth system models that generally operate on a mesh system also requires repetitive forward and inverse transforms. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a method that functions efficiently on an unstructured mesh, thus capturing the physics operating at kilometer scale yet capable of simulating geophysical observables that are inherently of global scale with minimal computational cost. The goal of the current version of this model is to provide high-resolution solidearth, gravitational, sea-level and rotational responses for earth system models operating in the domain of the earth's outer fluid envelope on timescales less than about 1 century when viscous effects can largely be ignored over most of the globe. The model has numerous important geophysical applications. For example, we compute time-varying computations of global geodetic and sea-level signatures associated with recent ice-sheet changes that are derived from space gravimetry observations. We also demonstrate the capability of our model to simultaneously resolve kilometer-scale sources of the earth's time-varying surface mass transport, derived from high-resolution modeling of polar ice sheets, and predict the corresponding local and global geodetic signatures.

An 11-year global gridded aerosol optical thickness reanalysis (v1.0) for atmospheric and climate sciences	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												While stand alone satellite and model aerosol products see wide utilization, there is a significant need in numerous atmospheric and climate applications for a fused product on a regular grid. Aerosol data assimilation is an operational reality at numerous centers, and like meteorological reanalyses, aerosol reanalyses will see significant use in the near future. Here we present a standardized 2003-2013 global 1 x 1 degrees and 6-hourly modal aerosol optical thickness (AOT) reanalysis product. This data set can be applied to basic and applied Earth system science studies of significant aerosol events, aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction, and electro-optical propagation and sensor performance, among other uses. This paper describes the science of how to develop and score an aerosol reanalysis product. This reanalysis utilizes a modified Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) at its core and assimilates quality controlled retrievals of AOT from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) on Terra. The aerosol source functions, including dust and smoke, were regionally tuned to obtain the best match between the model fine-and coarse-mode AOTs and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOTs. Other model processes, including deposition, were tuned to minimize the AOT difference between the model and satellite AOT. Aerosol wet deposition in the tropics is driven with satellite-retrieved precipitation, rather than the model field. The final reanalyzed fine-and coarse-mode AOT at 550 nm is shown to have good agreement with AERONET observations, with global mean root mean square error around 0.1 for both fine-and coarse-mode AOTs. This paper includes a discussion of issues particular to aerosol reanalyses that make them distinct from standard meteorological reanalyses, considerations for extending such a reanalysis outside of the NASA A-Train era, and examples of how the aerosol reanalysis can be applied or fused with other model or remote sensing products. Finally, the reanalysis is evaluated in comparison with other available studies of aerosol trends, and the implications of this comparison are discussed.

Magnesite deposits are of three types: (1) Massive or crystalline, (2) Cryptocrystalline and (3) Sedimentary. Cryptocrystalline and sedimentary type magnesite deposits are widespread all over Turkey although the massive type deposits are seemingly absent. In this study, we examined the sedimentary magnesite deposits of Hirsizdere, located in the province of Denizli, SW Turkey. The deposits formed as five beds within an ultramafic environment. The thickness of the magnesite beds can reach up to 4 meters and may be traced up to 3 km from west to east. The deposit comprises half a million tons of magnesite with some associated dolomite.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1373-3				2016	1726								020115	10.1063/1.4945941							WOS:000376001000115

Two-dimensional SSH can be reconstructed using mapping techniques; however, the spatial resolution is quite coarse even when data from several altimeters are analyzed. A new satellite mission based on radar interferometry is scheduled to be launched in 2020. This mission, called Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT), will measure SSH at high resolution along a wide swath, thus providing two-dimensional images of the ocean surface topography. This new capability will provide a large amount of data even though they are contaminated with instrument noise and geophysical errors. This paper presents a tool that simulates synthetic observations of SSH from the future SWOT mission using SSH from any ocean general circulation model (OGCM). SWOT-like data have been generated from a high-resolution model and analyzed to investigate the sampling and accuracy characteristics of the future SWOT data. This tool will help explore new ideas and methods for optimizing the retrieval of information from future SWOT missions.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JAN	2016	33	1					119	126		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0160.1							WOS:000376243100008

A cross-spectral analysis indicates that the SSH and SWH errors are nearly white and significantly correlated at scales from 12 to 100 km, consistent with the hypothesized error source, the waveform retracker. Because of the scale separation between the SWH signal and noise, it is possible to correct the SSH data by removing the SSH noise correlated with the SWH noise. Such a correction has been implemented using the empirical correlation found during the Jason-2 calibration orbit phase and applied to independent data from other phases of the Jason-1 mission. The efficacy of the correction varies geographically, but variance reductions between 1.6 and 2.2 cm 2 have been obtained, corresponding to reductions of 20%-27% in the noise floor of along-track spectra. The corrections are obtained from and applied to conventional, 1 Hz, altimetry data and lead to improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio for identification of high-frequency narrowband processes-for example, internal tides-from these data.																	0739-0572	1520-0426				JAN	2016	33	1					201	210		10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0164.1							WOS:000376243100014

The underlying verification procedure is based on a systematic search of potentially faulty system behaviors, which can be computationally expensive for larger problem sizes. In this paper we consider if it is possible to significantly reduce the runtime requirements of a verification with cloud computing techniques. We explore the use of large numbers of CPU-cores, that each perform small, fast, independent, and randomly different searches to achieve the same problem coverage as a much slower stand-alone run on a single CPU.

Several case studies based on individual trajectories from the Arctic winter 2009/2010 were conducted, with the trajectories chosen such that the first processing of the air mass by PSCs in this winter occurred on the trajectory. Transitions of PSC composition classes were observed to be highly dependent on the temperature history. In cases of a gradual temperature decrease, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and super-cooled ternary solution (STS) mixture clouds were observed. In cases of rapid temperature decrease, STS clouds were first observed, followed by NAT/STS mixture clouds. When temperatures dropped below the frost point, ice clouds formed and then transformed into NAT/STS mixture clouds when temperature increased above the frost point. The threshold temperature for rapid chlorine activation on PSCs is approximately 4aEuro-K below the NAT existence temperature, T-NAT. Furthermore, simulations of the ATLAS chemistry and transport box model along the trajectories were used to corroborate the measurements and show good agreement with the observations. Rapid chlorine activation was observed when an air mass encountered PSCs. Usually, chlorine activation was limited by the amount of available ClONO2. Where ClONO2 was not the limiting factor, a large dependence on temperature was evident.

Global HCFC-22 measurements with MIPAS: retrieval, validation, global distribution and its evolution over 2005-2012	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												We report on HCFC-22 data acquired by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) in the reduced spectral resolution nominal observation mode. The data cover the period from January 2005 to April 2012 and the altitude range from the upper troposphere (above cloud top altitude) to about 50 km. The profile retrieval was performed by constrained nonlinear least squares fitting of modelled spectra to the measured limb spectral radiances. The spectral nu(4)-band at 816.5 +/- 13 cm(-1) was used for the retrieval. A Tikhonov-type smoothing constraint was applied to stabilise the retrieval. In the lower stratosphere, we find a global volume mixing ratio of HCFC-22 of about 185 pptv in January 2005. The rate of linear growth in the lower latitudes lower stratosphere was about 6 to 7aEuro-pptvaEuro-year(-1) in the period 2005-2012. The profiles obtained were compared with ACE-FTS satellite data v3.5, as well as with MkIV balloon profiles and cryosampler balloon measurements. Between 13 and 22 km, average agreement within -3 to +5 pptv (MIPAS - ACE) with ACE-FTS v3.5 profiles is demonstrated. Agreement with MkIV solar occultation balloon-borne measurements is within 10-20 pptv below 30 km and worse above, while in situ cryosampler balloon measurements are systematically lower over their full altitude range by 15-50 pptv below 24 km and less than 10 pptv above 28 km. MIPAS HCFC-22 time series below 10 km altitude are shown to agree mostly well to corresponding time series of near-surface abundances from the NOAA/ESRL and AGAGE networks, although a more pronounced seasonal cycle is obvious in the satellite data. This is attributed to tropopause altitude fluctuations and subsidence of polar winter stratospheric air into the troposphere. A parametric model consisting of constant, linear, quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and several sine and cosine terms with different periods has been fitted to the temporal variation of stratospheric HCFC-22 for all 10A degrees-latitude/1-to-2-km-altitude bins. The relative linear variation was always positive, with relative increases of 40-70 % decade(-1) in the tropics and global lower stratosphere, and up to 120 % decade(-1) in the upper stratosphere of the northern polar region and the southern extratropical hemisphere. Asian HCFC-22 emissions have become the major source of global upper tropospheric HCFC-22. In the upper troposphere, monsoon air, rich in HCFC-22, is instantaneously mixed into the tropics. In the middle stratosphere, between 20 and 30 km, the observed trend is inconsistent with the trend at the surface (corrected for the age of stratospheric air), hinting at circulation changes. There exists a stronger positive trend in HCFC-22 in the Southern Hemisphere and a more muted positive trend in the Northern Hemisphere, implying a potential change in the stratospheric circulation over the observation period.

Toward consistency between trends in bottom-up CO2 emissions and top-down atmospheric measurements in the Los Angeles megacity	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Large urban emissions of greenhouse gases result in large atmospheric enhancements relative to background that are easily measured. Using CO2 mole fractions and delta C-14 and delta C-13 values of CO2 in the Los Angeles megacity observed in inland Pasadena (2006-2013) and coastal Palos Verdes peninsula (autumn 2009-2013), we have determined time series for CO2 contributions from fossil fuel combustion (C-ff) for both sites and broken those down into contributions from petroleum and/or gasoline and natural gas burning for Pasadena. We find a 10 % reduction in Pasadena C-ff during the Great Recession of 2008-2010, which is consistent with the bottom-up inventory determined by the California Air Resources Board. The isotopic variations and total atmospheric CO2 from our observations are used to infer seasonality of natural gas and petroleum combustion. The trend of CO2 contributions to the atmosphere from natural gas combustion is out of phase with the seasonal cycle of total natural gas combustion seasonal patterns in bottom-up inventories but is consistent with the seasonality of natural gas usage by the area's electricity generating power plants. For petroleum, the inferred seasonality of CO2 contributions from burning petroleum is delayed by several months relative to usage indicated by statewide gasoline taxes. Using the high-resolution Hestia-LA data product to compare C-ff from parts of the basin sampled by winds at different times of year, we find that variations in observed fossil fuel CO2 reflect seasonal variations in wind direction. The seasonality of the local CO2 excess from fossil fuel combustion along the coast, on Palos Verdes peninsula, is higher in autumn and winter than spring and summer, almost completely out of phase with that from Pasadena, also because of the annual variations of winds in the region. Variations in fossil fuel CO2 signals are consistent with sampling the bottom-up Hestia-LA fossil CO2 emissions product for sub-city source regions in the LA megacity domain when wind directions are considered.																	1680-7316	1680-7324					2016	16	6					3843	3863		10.5194/acp-16-3843-2016							WOS:000374702300009

Direct measurements of OH and other product yields from the HO(2)aEuro- +aEuro-CH3C(O)O-2 reaction	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The reaction CH3C(O)O(2)aEuro-+aEuro-HO2 -> aEuro parts per thousand CH3C(O)OOHaEuro-+aEuro-O-2 (Reaction R5a), CH3C(O)OHaEuro-+aEuro-O-3 (Reaction R5b), CH(3)aEuro-+aEuro-CO(2)aEuro-+aEuro-OHaEuro-+aEuro-O-2 (Reaction R5c) was studied in a series of experiments conducted at 1000aEuro-mbar and (293aEuro-+/- aEuro-2)aEuro-K in the HIRAC simulation chamber. For the first time, products, (CH3C(O)OOH, CH3C(O)OH, O-3 and OH) from all three branching pathways of the reaction have been detected directly and simultaneously. Measurements of radical precursors (CH3OH, CH3CHO), HO2 and some secondary products HCHO and HCOOH further constrained the system. Fitting a comprehensive model to the experimental data, obtained over a range of conditions, determined the branching ratios alpha((R5a))aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand= aEuro-0.37aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.10, alpha((R5b)) = aEuro-0.12aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.04 and alpha((R5c)) = aEuro-0.51aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.12 (errors at 2 sigma level). Improved measurement/model agreement was achieved using k((R5)) = (2.4aEuro-+/- aEuro-0.4)aEuro-aEuro parts per thousand x aEuro-10(-11)aEuro-cm(3)aEuro-molecule(-1)aEuro-s(-1), which is within the large uncertainty of the current IUPAC and JPL recommended rate coefficients for the title reaction. The rate coefficient and branching ratios are in good agreement with a recent study performed by Gro<remove> et al. (2014b); taken together, these two studies show that the rate of OH regeneration through Reaction (R5) is more rapid than previously thought. GEOS-Chem has been used to assess the implications of the revised rate coefficients and branching ratios; the modelling shows an enhancement of up to 5 % in OH concentrations in tropical rainforest areas and increases of up to 10 % at altitudes of 6-8 km above the equator, compared to calculations based on the IUPAC recommended rate coefficient and yield. The enhanced rate of acetylperoxy consumption significantly reduces PAN in remote regions (up to 30 %) with commensurate reductions in background NOx.

UTLS water vapour from SCIAMACHY limb measurements V3.01 (2002-2012)	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) aboard the Envisat satellite provided measurements from August 2002 until April 2012. SCIAMACHY measured the scattered or direct sunlight using different observation geometries. The limb viewing geometry allows the retrieval of water vapour at about 10-25 km height from the near-infrared spectral range (1353-1410 nm). These data cover the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), a region in the atmosphere which is of special interest for a variety of dynamical and chemical processes as well as for the radiative forcing. Here, the latest data version of water vapour (V3.01) from SCIAMACHY limb measurements is presented and validated by comparisons with data sets from other satellite and in situ measurements. Considering retrieval tests and the results of these comparisons, the V3.01 data are reliable from about 11 to 23 km and the best results are found in the middle of the profiles between about 14 and 20 km. Above 20 km in the extra tropics V3.01 is drier than all other data sets. Additionally, for altitudes above about 19 km, the vertical resolution of the retrieved profile is not sufficient to resolve signals with a short vertical structure like the tape recorder. Below 14 km, SCIAMACHY water vapour V3.01 is wetter than most col-located data sets, but the high variability of water vapour in the troposphere complicates the comparison. For 14-20 km height, the expected errors from the retrieval and simulations and the mean differences to collocated data sets are usually smaller than 10% when the resolution of the SCIAMACHY data is taken into account. In general, the temporal changes agree well with collocated data sets except for the Northern Hemisphere extratropical stratosphere, where larger differences are observed. This indicates a possible drift in V3.01 most probably caused by the incomplete treatment of volcanic aerosols in the retrieval. In all other regions a good temporal stability is shown. In the tropical stratosphere an increase in water vapour is found between 2002 and 2012, which is in agreement with other satellite data sets for overlapping time periods.

Improved retrieval of gas abundances from near-infrared solar FTIR spectra measured at the Karlsruhe TCCON station	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												We present a modified retrieval strategy for solar absorption spectra recorded by the Karlsruhe Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which is operational within the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). In typical TCCON stations, the 3800-11 000 cm(-1) spectral region is measured on a single extended Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) detector. The Karlsruhe setup instead splits the spectrum across an Indium Antimonide (InSb) and InGaAs detector through the use of a dichroic beam splitter. This permits measurements further into the mid-infrared (MIR) that are of scientific interest, but are not considered TCCON measurements. This optical setup induces, however, larger variations in the continuum level of the solar spectra than the typical TCCON setup. Here we investigate the appropriate treatment of continuum-level variations in the retrieval strategy using the spectra recorded in Karlsruhe. The broad spectral windows used by TCCON require special attention with respect to residual curvature in the spectral fits. To accommodate the unique setup of Karlsruhe, higher-order discrete Legendre polynomial basis functions have been enabled in the TCCON retrieval code to fit the continuum. This improves spectral fits and air-mass dependencies for affected spectral windows. After fitting the continuum curvature, the Karlsruhe greenhouse gas records are in good agreement with other European TCCON data sets.

For the MIPAS full-resolution period (2002-2004) these are V5H_CH4_21 and V5H_N2O_21 and for the reduced-resolution period (2005-2012) these are V5R_CH4_224, V5R_CH4_225, V5R_N2O_224 and V5R_N2O_225. Here, we compare CH4 profiles to those measured by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on board of the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE-FTS), the HALogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) and the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIA-MACHY), to the Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network (GCASN) surface data. We find the MIPAS CH4 profiles below 25 km to be typically higher of the order of 0.1 ppmv for both measurement periods. N2O profiles are compared to those measured by ACE-FTS, the Microwave Limb Sounder on board of the Aura satellite (Aura-MLS) and the Sub-millimetre Radiometer on board of the Odin satellite (Odin-SMR) as well as to the Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species Group (HATS) surface data. The mixing ratios of the satellite instruments agree well with each other for the full-resolution period. For the reduced-resolution period, MIPAS produces similar values as Odin-SMR, but higher values than ACE-FTS and HATS. Below 27 km, the MIPAS profiles show higher mixing ratios than Aura-MLS, and lower values between 27 and 41 km. Cross-comparisons between the two MIPAS measurement periods show that they generally agree quite well, but, especially for CH4, the reduced-resolution period seems to produce slightly higher mixing ratios than the full-resolution data.

Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) cloud screening algorithms: validation against collocated MODIS and CALIOP data	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The objective of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission is to retrieve the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction (X-CO2) from satellite measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared. These estimates can be biased by clouds and aerosols, i.e., contamination, within the instrument's field of view. Screening of the most contaminated soundings minimizes unnecessary calls to the computationally expensive Level 2 (L2) X-CO2 retrieval algorithm. Hence, robust cloud screening methods have been an important focus of the OCO-2 algorithm development team. Two distinct, computationally inexpensive cloud screening algorithms have been developed for this application. The A-Band Preprocessor (ABP) retrieves the surface pressure using measurements in the 0.76 mu m O-2 A band, neglecting scattering by clouds and aerosols, which introduce photon path-length differences that can cause large deviations between the expected and retrieved surface pressure. The Iterative Maximum A Posteriori (IMAP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) Preprocessor (IDP) retrieves independent estimates of the CO2 and H2O column abundances using observations taken at 1.61 mu m (weak CO2 band) and 2.06 mu m (strong CO2 band), while neglecting atmospheric scattering. The CO2 and H2O column abundances retrieved in these two spectral regions differ significantly in the presence of cloud and scattering aerosols. The combination of these two algorithms, which are sensitive to different features in the spectra, provides the basis for cloud screening of the OCO-2 data set. To validate the OCO-2 cloud screening approach, collocated measurements from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), aboard the Aqua platform, were compared to results from the two OCO-2 cloud screening algorithms. With tuning of algorithmic threshold parameters that allows for processing of similar or equal to 20-25% of all OCO-2 soundings, agreement between the OCO-2 and MODIS cloud screening methods is found to be similar or equal to 85% over four 16-day orbit repeat cycles in both the winter (December) and spring (April-May) for OCO-2 nadir-land, glint-land and glint-water observations. No major, systematic, spatial or temporal dependencies were found, although slight differences in the seasonal data sets do exist and validation is more problematic with increasing solar zenith angle and when surfaces are covered in snow and ice and have complex topography. To further analyze the performance of the cloud screening algorithms, an initial comparison of OCO-2 observations was made to collocated measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). These comparisons highlight the strength of the OCO-2 cloud screening algorithms in identifying high, thin clouds but suggest some difficulty in identifying some clouds near the surface, even when the optical thicknesses are greater than 1.

J	Olsen, KS; Toon, GC; Boone, CD; Strong, K				Olsen, Kevin S.; Toon, Geoffrey C.; Boone, Chris D.; Strong, Kimberly			New temperature and pressure retrieval algorithm for high-resolution infrared solar occultation spectroscopy: analysis and validation against ACE-FTS and COSMIC	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Motivated by the initial selection of a high-resolution solar occultation Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) to fly to Mars on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, we have been developing algorithms for retrieving volume mixing ratio vertical profiles of trace gases, the primary component of which is a new algorithm and software for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and pressure from the spectra. In contrast to Earth-observing instruments, which can rely on accurate meteorological models, a priori information, and spacecraft position, Mars retrievals require a method with minimal reliance on such data. The temperature and pressure retrieval algorithms developed for this work were evaluated using Earth-observing spectra from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) FTS, a solar occultation instrument in orbit since 2003, and the basis for the instrument selected for a Mars mission. ACE-FTS makes multiple measurements during an occultation, separated in altitude by 1.5-5 km, and we analyse 10 CO2 vibration-rotation bands at each altitude, each with a different usable altitude range. We describe the algorithms and present results of their application and their comparison to the ACE-FTS data products. The Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) provides vertical profiles of temperature up to 40 km with high vertical resolution. Using six satellites and GPS radio occultation, COSMIC's data product has excellent temporal and spatial coverage, allowing us to find coincident measurements with ACE with very tight criteria: less than 1.5 h and 150 km. We present an intercomparison of temperature profiles retrieved from ACE-FTS using our algorithm, that of the ACE Science Team (v3.5), and from COSMIC. When our retrievals are compared to ACE-FTS v3.5, we find mean differences between -5 and +2K and that our retrieved profiles have no seasonal or zonal biases but do have a warm bias in the stratosphere and a cold bias in the mesosphere. When compared to COSMIC, we do not observe a warm/cool bias and mean differences are between -4 and +1 K. COSMIC comparisons are restricted to below 40 km, where our retrievals have the best agreement with ACE-FTS v3.5. When comparing ACE-FTS v3.5 to COSMIC we observe a cold bias in COSMIC of 0.5 K, and mean differences are between -0.9 and +0.6 K.

The combined use of the regularization and LIRIC methods reveals the night-to-day evolution of the vertical structure of the mineral dust microphysical properties and offers complementary information to that from column-integrated variables retrieved from passive remote sensing. Additionally, lidar depolarization profiles and LIRIC retrieved volume concentration are compared with aircraft in situ measurements. This study presents for the first time a comparison of the total volume concentration retrieved with LIRIC with independent in situ measurements, obtaining agreement within the estimated uncertainties for both methods and quite good agreement for the vertical distribution of the aerosol layers. Regarding the depolarization, the first published data set of the CAS-POL for polarization ratios is presented here and qualitatively compared with the lidar technique.In this work we present an analysis of aerosol microphysical properties during a mineral dust event taking advantage of the combination of different state-of-the-art retrieval techniques applied to active and passive remote sensing measurements and the evaluation of some of those techniques using independent data acquired from in situ aircraft measurements. Data were collected in a field campaign performed during a mineral dust outbreak at the Granada, Spain, experimental site (37.16 degrees N, 3.61 degrees W, 680ma.s.l.) on 27 June 2011. Column-integrated properties are provided by sun-and star-photometry, which allows for a continuous evaluation of the mineral dust optical properties during both day and nighttime. Both the linear estimation and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) inversion algorithms are applied for the retrieval of the column-integrated microphysical particle properties. In addition, vertically resolved microphysical properties are obtained from a multi-wavelength Raman lidar system included in EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network), by using both LIRIC (Lidar Radiometer Inversion Code) algorithm during daytime and an algorithm applied to the Raman measurements based on the regularization technique during nighttime.

They now generally include the scattering effects of clouds and aerosols, as early work found that absorption-only retrievals, which neglected these effects, often incurred unacceptably large errors, even for scenes with optically thin cloud or aerosol layers. However, these "full-physics" retrievals tend to be computationally expensive and may incur biases from trying to deduce the properties of clouds and aerosols when there are none present. Additionally, algorithms are now available that can quickly and effectively identify and remove most scenes in which cloud or aerosol scattering plays a significant role. In this work, we test the hypothesis that non-scattering, or "clear-sky", retrievals may perform as well as full-physics retrievals for sufficiently clear scenes. Clear-sky retrievals could potentially avoid errors and biases brought about by trying to infer properties of clouds and aerosols when none are present. Clear-sky retrievals are also desirable because they are orders of magnitude faster than full-physics retrievals. Here we use a simplified version of the Atmospheric Carbon Observations from Space (ACOS) X-CO2 retrieval algorithm that does not include the scattering and absorption effects of clouds or aerosols. It was found that for simulated Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) measurements, the clear-sky retrieval had errors comparable to those of the full-physics retrieval. For real GOSAT data, the clear-sky retrieval had errors 0-20% larger than the full-physics retrieval over land and errors roughly 20-35% larger over ocean, depending on filtration level. In general, the clear-sky retrieval had X-CO2 root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of less than 2.0 ppm, relative to Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements and a suite of CO2 models, when adequately filtered through the use of a custom genetic algorithm filtering system. These results imply that non-scattering X-CO2 retrievals are potentially more useful than previous literature suggests, as the filtering methods we employ are able to remove measurements in which scattering can cause significant errors. Additionally, the computational benefits of non-scattering retrievals means they may be useful for certain applications that require large amounts of data but have less stringent error requirements.

J	Colosimo, SF; Natraj, V; Sander, SP; Stutz, J				Colosimo, Santo Fedele; Natraj, Vijay; Sander, Stanley P.; Stutz, Jochen			A sensitivity study on the retrieval of aerosol vertical profiles using the oxygen A-band	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Atmospheric absorption in the O-2 A-band (12 950-13 200 cm(-1)) offers a unique opportunity to retrieve aerosol extinction profiles from space-borne measurements due to the large dynamic range of optical thickness in that spectral region. Absorptions in strong O-2 lines are saturated; therefore, any radiance measured in these lines originates from scattering in the upper part of the atmosphere. Outside of O-2 lines, or in weak lines, the atmospheric column absorption is small, and light penetrates to lower atmospheric layers, allowing for the quantification of aerosols and other scatterers near the surface. While the principle of aerosol profile retrieval using O-2 A-band absorption from space is well-known, a thorough quantification of the information content, i.e., the amount of vertical profile information that can be obtained, and the dependence of the information content on the spectral resolution of the measurements, has not been thoroughly conducted. Here, we use the linearized vector radiative transfer model VLIDORT to perform spectrally resolved simulations of atmospheric radiation in the O-2 A-band for four different aerosol extinction profile scenarios: urban (urban-rural areas), highly polluted (megacity areas with large aerosol extinction), elevated layer (identifying elevated plumes, for example for biomass burning) and low extinction (representative of small aerosol extinction, such as vegetated, marine and arctic areas). The high-resolution radiances emerging from the top of the atmosphere measurements are degraded to different spectral resolutions, simulating spectrometers with different resolving powers. We use optimal estimation theory to quantify the information content in the aerosol profile retrieval with respect to different aerosol parameters and instrument spectral resolutions. The simulations show that better spectral resolution generally leads to an increase in the total amount of information that can be retrieved, with the number of degrees of freedom (DoF) varying between 0.34-2.01 at low resolution (5 cm(-1)) to 3.43-5.38 at high resolution (0.05 cm(-1)) among all the different cases. A particularly strong improvement was found in the retrieval of tropospheric aerosol extinction profiles in the lowest 5 km of the atmosphere. At high spectral resolutions (0.05 cm(-1)), 1.18-1.48 and 1.31-1.96 DoF can be obtained in the lower (0-2 km) and middle (2-5 km) troposphere, respectively, for the different cases. Consequently, a separation of lower and mid tropospheric aerosols is possible, implying the feasibility of identification of elevated biomass burning aerosol plumes (elevated layer scenario). We find that a higher single scattering albedo (SSA) allows for the retrieval of more aerosol information. However, the dependence on SSA is weaker at higher spectral resolutions. The vegetation (surface albedo 0.3), marine (surface albedo 0.05) and arctic (surface albedo 0.9) cases show that the dependence of DoF on the surface albedo decreases with higher resolution. At low resolution (5 cm(-1)), the DoF are 1.19 for the marine case, 0.73 for the vegetation case and 0.34 for the arctic case, but increase considerably at 0.05 cm(-1) resolution to 3.84 (marine) and 3.43 (both vegetation and arctic), showing an improvement of a factor of 10 for the arctic case. Vegetation and arctic case also show the same DoF at higher resolution, showing that an increase of albedo beyond a certain value, i.e., 0.3 in our case, does not lead to a larger information content. The simulations also reveal a moderate dependence of information content on the integration time of the measurements, i.e., the noise of the spectra. However, our results indicate that a larger increase in DoF is obtained by an increase in spectral resolution despite lower signal-to-noise ratios.

Single-Anchor 2-D Magnetoquasistatic Position Sensing for Short to Long Ranges Above Ground	IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS												Recent developments in long-range magnetoquasistatic position sensing have enabled the decoupling of one-dimensional (1-D) range and orientation of the mobile device to be sensed. By advancing the theory, we demonstrate accurate two-dimensional (2-D) position sensing using a single-anchor system through the decoupling of azimuthal-direction angle of the mobile device.

An atomic layer deposition process using trimethylaluminum and anhydrous hydrogen fluoride has been developed for the deposition of AlF3 at substrate temperatures between 100 and 200 degrees C. This low temperature process has resulted in thin films with UV-optical properties that have been characterized by ellipsometric and reflection/transmission measurements at wavelengths down to 200 nm. The optical loss for 93 nm thick films deposited at 100 degrees C was measured to be less than 0.2% from visible wavelengths down to 200 nm, and additional microstructural characterization demonstrates that the films are amorphous with moderate tensile stress of 42-105MPa as deposited on silicon substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows no signature of residual aluminum oxide components making these films good candidates for a variety of applications at even shorter UV wavelengths.

Various types of masks could be employed to suppress the host starlight to about 10-9 level contrast over a broad spectrum to enable the coronagraph mission objectives. Such masks for high-contrast internal coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultralow reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, and achromaticity. We present the approaches employed at JPL to produce pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks by combining electron beam, deep reactive ion etching, and black silicon technologies with illustrative examples of each, highlighting milestone accomplishments from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at JPL and from the High Contrast Imaging Lab at Princeton University.

Each architecture relies on newly developed mask components to function in the presence of the AFTA aperture, and so both must be matured to a high technology readiness level in advance of the mission.

J	Kern, B				Kern, Brian			Impact of WFIRST-AFTA line-of-sight jitter distributions on phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph science yield	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS												A framework for evaluating the science yield of a coronagraph in the presence of a variety of line-of-sight jitter environments is described and the use of a tip-tilt threshold for improving science yield is proposed. The current expectations of the WFIRST-AFTA mission are used for specific distributions of line-of-sight jitter, including the current expectations for tip-tilt correction using a low-order wavefront sensor/control. The effect of the residual tip-tilt on the phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph (PIAACMC) architecture is considered, because the performance of the PIAACMC architecture is expected to be dominated by tip-tilt sensitivity, implying that this treatment has a large impact on the final science yield. The most important outcomes of this study are that the rms residual tip-tilt expected after correction is 0.6 mas rms/axis and that by eliminating some science frames during analysis through a tip-tilt threshold, the number of planets observable increases by similar to 25% for the 550-nm imaging channel. The number of known radial velocity planets expected to be observed ranges from 29 to 78 at 550 nm and from 9 to 12 at 890 nm.

The mask has many small features (similar to micron lateral scales) and was fabricated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Microdevices Laboratory, then characterized using a scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, and optical interferometric microscope. The measured fabrication errors were then fed to a wavefront control model which predicts the contrast performance of a full coronagraph. The expected coronagraphic performance using this mask is consistent with observing similar to 15 planetary targets with WFIRST-AFTA in a reasonable time (<1 day/target).

The telescope, however, is not ideal, given its obscured aperture. Only recently have coronagraph designs been thoroughly investigated that can efficiently work with this configuration. Three coronagraph designs, the hybrid Lyot, shaped pupil, and phase-induced amplitude apodization complex mask coronagraph have been selected for further development by the Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset project. Real-world testbed demonstrations of these have just begun, so for now, the most reliable means of evaluating their potential performance comes from numerical modeling incorporating diffraction propagation, realistic system models, and simulated wavefront sensing and control. Here, we present the methods of performance evaluation and results for the current coronagraph designs.

It produces starlight suppression over the full 360-deg annular region and thus is particularly suitable to improve the discovery space around WFIRST-AFTA targets. Since being selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in December 2013, the coronagraph technology is being matured to technology readiness level 5 by September 2016. We present the progress of HLC key component fabrication and testbed demonstrations with the WFIRST-AFTA pupil. For the first time, a circular HLC occulter mask consisting of metal and dielectric layers is fabricated and characterized. Wavefront control using two deformable mirrors is successfully demonstrated in a vacuum testbed with narrowband light (<1-nm bandwidth at 516 nm) to obtain repeatable convergence below 8 x 10(-9) mean contrast in the 360-deg dark hole with a working angle between 3 lambda/D and 9 lambda/D with arbitrary polarization.

The LOWFS/C uses the rejected stellar light from the coronagraph to sense and suppress the telescope pointing errors as well as low-order wavefront errors (WFEs) due to changes in thermal loading of the telescope and the rest of the observatory. We will present a conceptual design of a LOWFS/C subsystem for the WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph. This LOWFS/C uses a Zernike phase contrast wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with a phase shifting disk combined with the stellar light rejecting occulting masks, a key concept to minimize the noncommon path error. We will present our analysis of the sensor performance and evaluate the performance of the line-of-sight jitter suppression loop, as well as the low-order WFE correction loop with a deformable mirror on the coronagraph. We will also report the LOWFS/C testbed design and the preliminary in-air test results, which show a very promising performance of the ZWFS.

Here we estimate the expected science yield of the CGI for known radial-velocity (RV) planets and potential circumstellar disks. The science return is estimated for three types of coronagraphs: the hybrid Lyot and shaped pupil are the currently planned designs, and the phase-induced amplitude apodizing complex mask coronagraph is the backup design. We compare the potential performance of each type for imaging as well as spectroscopy. We find that the RV targets can be imaged in sufficient numbers to produce substantial advances in the science of nearby exoplanets. To illustrate the potential for circumstellar disk detections, we estimate the brightness of zodiacal-type disks, which could be detected simultaneously during RV planet observations.

However, the requisite imaging contrast, at levels of 1 billion to one or better for the direct imaging of cool mature exoplanets in reflected visible starlight, leads to challenging new requirements on the stability and control of the optical wavefront, at levels currently beyond the reach of ground-based telescopes. We review the design, performance, and science prospects for the hybrid Lyot coronagraph (HLC) on the WFIRST-AFTA telescope. Together with a pair of deformable mirrors for active wavefront control, the HLC creates a full 360-deg high-contrast dark field of view at 10(-9) contrast levels or better, extending to within angular separations of 3 lambda(0)/D from the central star, over spectral bandwidths of 10% or more.

Atmospheric polarimetric effects on GNSS radio occultations: the ROHP-PAZ field campaign	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												This study describes the first experimental observations showing that hydrometeors induce polarimetric signatures in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. This evidence is relevant to the PAZ low Earth orbiter, which will test the concept and applications of polarimetric GNSS radio occultation (RO) (i.e. ROs obtained with a dual-polarization antenna). A ground field campaign was carried out in preparation for PAZ to verify the theoretical sensitivity studies on this concept (Cardellach et al., 2015). The main aim of the campaign is to identify and understand the factors that might affect the polarimetric GNSS observables. Studied for the first time, GNSS signals measured with two polarimetric antennas (H, horizontal, and V, vertical) are shown to discriminate between heavy rain events by comparing the measured phase difference between the H and V phase delays (18) in different weather scenarios. The measured phase difference indicates higher dispersion under rain conditions. When individual events are examined, significant increases in 18 occur when the radio signals cross rain cells. Moreover, the amplitude of such a signal is much higher than the theoretical prediction for precipitation; thus, other sources of polarimetric signatures have been explored and identified. Modelling of other hydrometeors, such as melting particles and ice crystals, have been proposed to explain the obtained measurements, with good agreement in more than 90% of the cases.

Hard X-ray emission of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 as observed by NuSTAR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS												We present a broadband (similar to 0.3-70 keV) spectral and temporal analysis of NuSTAR observations of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 combined with archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and BeppoSAX data. NGC 6240 is a galaxy in a relatively early merger state with two distinct nuclei separated by similar to 1.''5. Previous Chandra observations resolved the two nuclei and showed that they are both active and obscured by Compton-thick material. Although they cannot be resolved by NuSTAR, we were able to clearly detect, for the first time, both the primary and the reflection continuum components thanks to the unprecedented quality of the NuSTAR data at energies >10 keV. The NuSTAR hard X-ray spectrum is dominated by the primary continuum piercing through an absorbing column density which is mildly optically thick to Compton scattering (tau similar or equal to 1.2, N-H similar to 1.5 x 10(24) cm(-2)). We detect moderately hard X-ray (>10 keV) flux variability up to 20% on short (15-20 ks) timescales. The amplitude of the variability is largest at similar to 30 keV and is likely to originate from the primary continuum of the southern nucleus. Nevertheless, the mean hard X-ray flux on longer timescales (years) is relatively constant. Moreover, the two nuclei remain Compton-thick, although we find evidence of variability in the material along the line of sight with column densities N-H <= 2 x 1023 cm(-2) over long (similar to 3-15 yr) timescales. The observed X-ray emission in the NuSTAR energy range is fully consistent with the sum of the best-fit models of the spatially resolved Chandra spectra of the two nuclei.

Precipitation climatology over India: validation with observations and reanalysis datasets and spatial trends	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Changing rainfall patterns have significant effect on water resources, agriculture output in many countries, especially the country like India where the economy depends on rain-fed agriculture. Rainfall over India has large spatial as well as temporal variability. To understand the variability in rainfall, spatial-temporal analyses of rainfall have been studied by using 107 (1901-2007) years of daily gridded India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets. Further, the validation of IMD precipitation data is carried out with different observational and different reanalysis datasets during the period from 1989 to 2007. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project data shows similar features as that of IMD with high degree of comparison, whereas Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation data show similar features but with large differences, especially over northwest, west coast and western Himalayas. Spatially, large deviation is observed in the interior peninsula during the monsoon season with National Aeronautics Space Administration-Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (NASA-MERRA), pre-monsoon with Japanese 25 years Re Analysis (JRA-25), and post-monsoon with climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) reanalysis datasets. Among the reanalysis datasets, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) shows good comparison followed by CFSR, NASA-MERRA, and JRA-25. Further, for the first time, with high resolution and long-term IMD data, the spatial distribution of trends is estimated using robust regression analysis technique on the annual and seasonal rainfall data with respect to different regions of India. Significant positive and negative trends are noticed in the whole time series of data during the monsoon season. The northeast and west coast of the Indian region shows significant positive trends and negative trends over western Himalayas and north central Indian region.

Causes of WRF surface energy fluxes biases in a stratocumulus region	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												In this study, we evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model to simulate surface energy fluxes in the southeast Pacific stratocumulus region. A total of 18 simulations is performed for the period of October to November 2008, with various combinations of boundary layer, microphysics, and cumulus schemes. Simulated surface energy fluxes are compared to those measured during VOCALS-REx. Using a process-based model evaluation, errors in surface fluxes are attributed to errors in cloud properties. Net surface flux errors are mostly traceable to errors in cloud liquid water path (LWPcld), which produce biases in downward shortwave radiation. Two mechanisms controlling LWPcld are diagnosed. One involves microphysics schemes, which control LWPcld through the production of raindrops. The second mechanism involves boundary layer and cumulus schemes, which control moisture available for cloud by regulating boundary layer height. In this study, we demonstrate that when parameterizations are appropriately chosen, the stratocumulus deck and the related surface energy fluxes are reasonably well represented. In the most realistic experiments, the net surface flux is underestimated by about 10 W m(-2). This remaining low bias is due to a systematic overestimation of the total surface cooling due to sensible and latent heat fluxes in our simulations. There does not appear to be a single physical reason for this bias. Finally, our results also suggest that inaccurate representation of boundary layer height is an important factor limiting further gains in model realism.																	0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	2016	46	1-2					571	584		10.1007/s00382-015-2599-9							WOS:000370040100036

Information-rich spectral channels for simulated retrievals of partial column-averaged methane	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE												Space-based remote sensing of the column-averaged methane dry air mole fraction (XCH4) has greatly increased our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns in the global methane cycle. The potential to retrieve multiple pieces of vertical profile information would further improve the quantification of CH4 across space-time scales. We conduct information analysis for channel selection and evaluate the prospects of retrieving multiple pieces of information as well as total column CH4 from both ground-based and space-based near-infrared remote sensing spectra. We analyze the degrees of freedom of signal (DOF) in the CH4 absorption bands near 2.3m and 1.6m and select approximate to 1% of the channels that contain >95% of the information about the CH4 profile. The DOF is around 4 for fine ground-based spectra (resolution=0.01cm(-1)) and 3 for coarse space-based spectra (resolution=0.20cm(-1)) based on channel selection and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 300. The DOF varies from 2.2 to 3.2 when SNR is between 100 and 300, and spectral resolution is 0.20cm(-1). Simulated retrieval tests in clear-sky conditions using the selected channels reveal that the retrieved partial column-averaged CH4 values are not sensitive to the a priori profiles and can reflect local enhancements of CH4 in different partial air columns. Both the total and partial column-averaged retrieval errors in all tests are within 1% of the true state. These simulated tests highlight the possibility to retrieve up to three to four pieces of information about the vertical distribution of CH4 in reality.

Coherent Model of L-Band Radar Scattering by Soybean Plants: Model Development, Evaluation, and Retrieval	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												An improved coherent branching model for L-band radar remote sensing of soybean is proposed by taking into account the correlated scattering among scatterers. The novel feature of the analytical coherent model consists of conditional probability functions to eliminate the overlapping effects of branches in the former branching models. Backscattering coefficients are considered for a variety of scenarios over the full growth cycle for vegetation water content (VWC) and the complete drydown conditions for soil moisture. The results of the coherent model show that HH scattering has a significant difference up to 3 dB from that of the independent scattering when VWC is low, e.g., 0.2 kg/m(2). Forward model calculations are performed for the scattering from the soybean field for the full range of three axes of root-mean-square (RMS) height of bare soil, VWC, and soil moisture using the coherent model. The soybean volume scattering including the double-bounce term is combined with the back scattering of bare soil from the numerical Maxwell solutions that incorporates RMS height, soil permittivity, and correlation length, to form the forward model lookup table for the vegetated soil. The results are compared with data from 13 soybean fields collected as part of the soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Time-series retrieval of soil moisture is also applied to the soybean fields by inverting the forward model lookup table. During the retrieval, the VWC is optimized with physical constraints obtained from ground measurements. The retrieval performances are significantly improved using the proposed coherent model: the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the soil moisture retrieval is decreased from 0.09 to 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) and the correlation coefficient is increased from 0.66 to 0.92.

In this paper, we assess the use of TanDEM-X data, in combination with an external digital terrain model (DTM), tomap boreal canopy heights. A comparison of the TanDEM-X canopy height model (CHM) to a validated reference lidar CHMwas performed based on two definitions of canopy height: canopy surface height (CSH) and dominant height (DH) at spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 25 m, and at stand level. We found the TanDEM-X CHM to have a coarser resolution than the corresponding lidar CHM. This was apparent in the height validation of the TanDEM-X CHM, which had a RMSE of 2.7 m at the 5-m resolution, 1.9 mat the 25-m resolution, and 1.5m at stand level. The height differences between the InSAR and lidar surfaces varied between 1.3 and 1.5 m, but InSAR heights were below the height of dominant trees by 4.6-7.5 m. Similar discrepancies were observed for the lidar CSH relatively to DH (6.04, 8.98, and 8.05 m, respectively). The results show that the TanDEM-X interferometric heights are very close to the lidar reference height and that penetration below the DH is caused by propagation of the microwave signal between the tree apices and the main foliage surface in boreal forest. Finally, the accuracy of InSAR height estimates was not sensitive to tree density effects, but was moderately affected by local incidence angles (LIAs), gap volume, and canopy height.

Spatio-temporal variability of snow water equivalent in the extra-tropical Andes Cordillera from distributed energy balance modeling and remotely sensed snow cover	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Seasonal snow cover is the primary water source for human use and ecosystems along the extratropical Andes Cordillera. Despite its importance, relatively little research has been devoted to understanding the properties, distribution and variability of this natural resource. This research provides high-resolution (500 m), daily distributed estimates of end-of-winter and spring snow water equivalent over a 152 000 km(2) domain that includes the mountainous reaches of central Chile and Argentina. Remotely sensed fractional snow-covered area and other relevant forcings are combined with extrapolated data from meteorological stations and a simplified physically based energy balance model in order to obtain melt-season melt fluxes that are then aggregated to estimate the end-of-winter (or peak) snow water equivalent (SWE). Peak SWE estimates show an overall coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.68 and RMSE of 274 mm compared to observations at 12 automatic snow water equivalent sensors distributed across the model domain, with R-2 values between 0.32 and 0.88. Regional estimates of peak SWE accumulation show differential patterns strongly modulated by elevation, latitude and position relative to the continental divide. The spatial distribution of peak SWE shows that the 4000-5000 a.s.l. elevation band is significant for snow accumulation, despite having a smaller surface area than the 3000-4000 a.s.l. band. On average, maximum snow accumulation is observed in early September in the western Andes, and in early October on the eastern side of the continental divide. The results presented here have the potential of informing applications such as seasonal forecast model assessment and improvement, regional climate model validation, as well as evaluation of observational networks and water resource infrastructure development.

Examination of Surface Temperature Modification by Open-Top Chambers along Moisture and Latitudinal Gradients in Arctic Alaska Using Thermal Infrared Photography	REMOTE SENSING												Passive warming manipulation methodologies, such as open-top chambers (OTCs), are a meaningful approach for interpretation of impacts of climate change on the Arctic tundra biome. The magnitude of OTC warming has been studied extensively, revealing an average plot-level warming of air temperature that ranges between 1 and 3 degrees C as measured by shielded resistive sensors or thermocouples. Studies have also shown that the amount of OTC warming depends in part on location climate, vegetation, and soil properties. While digital infrared thermometers have been employed in a few comparisons, most of the focus of the effectiveness of OTC warming has been on air or soil temperature rather than tissue or surface temperatures, which directly translate to metabolism. Here we used thermal infrared (TIR) photography to quantify tissue and surface temperatures and their spatial variability at a previously unavailable resolution (3-6 mm(2)). We analyzed plots at three locations that are part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX)-Arctic Observing Network (AON-ITEX) network along both moisture and latitudinal gradients spanning from the High Arctic (Barrow, AK, USA) to the Low Arctic (Toolik Lake, AK, USA). Our results show a range of OTC surface warming from 2.65 to 1.27 degrees C (31%-10%) at our three sites. The magnitude of surface warming detected by TIR imagery in this study was comparable to increases in air temperatures previously reported for these sites. However, the thermal images revealed wide ranges of surface temperatures within the OTCs, with some surfaces well above ambient unevenly distributed within the plots under sunny conditions. We note that analyzing radiometric temperature may be an alternative for future studies that examine data acquired at the same time of day from sites that are in close geographic proximity to avoid the requirement of emissivity or atmospheric correction for validation of results. We foresee future studies using TIR photography to describe species-level thermodynamics that could prove highly valuable toward a better understanding of species-specific responses to climate change in the Arctic.

Quantifying Marine Boundary Layer Water Vapor beneath Low Clouds with Near-Infrared and Microwave Imagery	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												This study investigates the synergy of collocated microwave radiometry and near-infrared imagery to estimate the marine boundary layer water vapor beneath uniform cloud fields. Microwave radiometry provides the total column water vapor, while the near-infrared imagery provides the water vapor above the cloud layers. The difference between the two gives the vapor between the surface and the cloud top, which may be interpreted as the boundary layer water vapor. In combining the two datasets, we apply several flags as well as proximity tests to remove pixels with high clouds and/or intrapixel heterogeneity. Comparisons against radiosonde and ECMWF reanalysis data demonstrate the robustness of these boundary layer water vapor estimates. Last, it is shown that the measured AMSR-MODIS boundary layer water vapor can be analyzed using sea surface temperature and cloud-top pressure information by employing simple equations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship.

Jupiter: Cosmic Jekyll and Hyde	ASTROBIOLOGY												It has been widely reported that Jupiter has a profound role in shielding the terrestrial planets from comet impacts in the Solar System, and that a jovian planet is a requirement for the evolution of life on Earth. To evaluate whether jovians, in fact, shield habitable planets from impacts (a phenomenon often referred to as the Jupiter as shield concept), this study simulated the evolution of 10,000 particles in each of the jovian inter-planet gaps for the cases of full-mass and embryo planets for up to 100 My. The results of these simulations predict a number of phenomena that not only discount the Jupiter as shield concept, they also predict that in a Solar System like ours, large gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter had a different, and potentially even more important, role in the evolution of life on our planet by delivering the volatile-laden material required for the formation of life. The simulations illustrate that, although all particles occupied non-life threatening orbits at their onset of the simulations, a significant fraction of the 30,000 particles evolved into Earth-crossing orbits. A comparison of multiple runs with different planetary configurations revealed that Jupiter was responsible for the vast majority of the encounters that kicked outer planet material into the terrestrial planet region, and that Saturn assisted in the process far more than has previously been acknowledged. Jupiter also tends to fix the aphelion of planetesimals at its orbit irrespective of their initial starting zones, which has the effect of slowing their passages through the inner Solar System, and thus potentially improving the odds of accretion of cometary material by terrestrial planets. As expected, the simulations indicate that the full-mass planets perturb many objects into the deep outer Solar System, or eject them entirely; however, planetary embryos also did this with surprising efficiency. Finally, the simulations predict that Jupiter's capacity to shield or intercept Earth-bound comets originating in the outer Solar System is poor, and that the importance of jovian planets on the formation of life is not that they act as shields, but rather that they deliver life-enabling volatiles to the terrestrial planets.

Increasing Daily Precipitation Intensity Associated with Warmer Air Temperatures over Northern Eurasia	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												This study uses 45 years of observational records from 517 historical surface weather stations over northern Eurasia to examine changing precipitation characteristics associated with increasing air temperatures. Results suggest that warming air temperatures over northern Eurasia have been accompanied by higher precipitation intensity but lower frequency and little change in annual precipitation total. An increase in daily precipitation intensity of around 1%-3% per each degree of air temperature increase is found for all seasons as long as a station's seasonal mean air temperature is below about 15 degrees-16 degrees C. This threshold temperature may be location dependent. At temperatures above this threshold, precipitation intensity switches to decreasing with increasing air temperature, possibly related to decreasing water vapor associated with extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, the major atmospheric circulation of the Arctic Oscillation, Scandinavian pattern, east Atlantic-western Eurasian pattern, and polar-Eurasian pattern also have significant influences on precipitation intensity in winter, spring, and summer over certain areas of northern Eurasia.

JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS												An analytical stress model is developed for the evaluation of thermal stresses in an inhomogeneously bonded assembly of the ball-grid-array (BGA) or column grid array (CGA) type. It is shown that one can get away with employing a simpler model intended for an assembly with a homogeneous bond, if the gaps between the supports (BGA balls or CGA columns) are small, so that the ratio of the pitch p (the distance between the joint centers) to the joint widths 2l is below 5, and the product kl of the parameter k of the interfacial shearing stress and half the assembly length l in the equivalent homogeneously bonded assembly is above 2.5. This is indeed the case for actual BGA and CGA systems.

A decade (2003-12) of landfalling ARs impacting the North American west coast (between 32.5 degrees and 52.5 degrees N) is collected to assess the skill of five commonly used satellite-based precipitation products [T3B42, T3B42 real-time (T3B42RT), CPC morphing technique (CMORPH), PERSIANN, and PERSIANN-Cloud Classification System (CCS)] in capturing ARs' precipitation rate and pattern. AR detection was carried out using a database containing twice-daily satellite-based integrated water vapor composite observations. It was found that satellite products are more consistent over ocean than land and often significantly underestimate precipitation rate over land compared to ground observations. Incorrect detection of precipitation from IR-based methods is prevalent over snow and ice surfaces where microwave estimates often show underestimation or missing data. Bias adjustment using ground observation is found very effective to improve satellite products, but it also raises concern regarding near-real-time applicability of satellite products for ARs. The analysis using individual case studies (6-8 January and 13-14 October 2009) and an ensemble of AR events suggests that further advancement in capturing orographic precipitation and precipitation over cold and frozen surfaces is needed to more reliably quantify AR precipitation from space.

Low water contents in diamond mineral inclusions: Proto-genetic origin in a dry cratonic lithosphere	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The mantle is the major reservoir of Earth's water, hosted within Nominally Anhydrous Minerals (NAMs) (e.g., Bell and Rossman, 1992; Peslier et al., 2010; Peslier, 2010; Nestola and Smyth, 2015), in the form of hydrogen bonded to the silicate's structural oxygen. From whence cometh this water? Is the water in these minerals representative of the Earth's primitive upper mantle or did it come from melting events linked to crustal formation or to more recent metasomatic/re-fertilization events? During diamond formation, NAMs are encapsulated at hundreds of kilometers depth within the mantle, thereby possibly shielding and preserving their pristine water contents from re-equilibrating with fluids and melts percolating through the lithospheric mantle. Here we show that the NAMs included in diamonds from six locales on the Siberian Craton contain measurable and variable H2O concentrations from 2 to 34 parts per million by weight (ppmw) in olivine, 7 to 276 ppmw in clinopyroxene, and 11-17 ppmw in garnets. Our results suggest that if the inclusions were in equilibrium with the diamond-forming fluid, the water fugacity would have been unrealistically low. Instead, we consider the H2O contents of the inclusions, shielded by diamonds, as pristine representatives of the residual mantle prior to encapsulation, and indicative of a protogenetic origin for the inclusions. Hydrogen diffusion in the diamond does not appear to have modified these values significantly. The H2O contents of NAMs in mantle xenoliths may represent some later metasomatic event(s), and are not always representative of most of the continental lithospheric mantle. Results from the present study also support the conclusions of Peslier et al. (2010) and Novella et al. (2015) that the dry nature of the SCLM of a craton may provide stabilization of its thickened continental roots. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This study asks the question of whether GCMs are ready to be operationalized for streamflow forecasting in South Asian river basins, and if so, at what temporal scales and for which water management decisions are they likely to be relevant? The authors focused on the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins for which there is a gridded hydrologic model calibrated for the 2002-10 period. The North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) suite of eight GCM hindcasts was applied to generate precipitation forecasts for each month of the 1982-2012 (30 year) period at up to 6 months of lead time, which were then downscaled according to the bias-corrected statistical downscaling (BCSD) procedure to daily time steps. A global retrospective forcing dataset was used for this downscaling procedure. The study clearly revealed that a regionally consistent forcing for BCSD, which is currently unavailable for the region, is one of the primary conditions to realize reasonable skill in streamflow forecasting. In terms of relative RMSE (normalized by reference flow obtained from the global retrospective forcings used in downscaling), streamflow forecast uncertainty (RMSE) was found to be 38%-50% at monthly scale and 22%-35% at seasonal (3 monthly) scale. The Ganges River (regulated) experienced higher uncertainty than the Brahmaputra River (unregulated). In terms of anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), the streamflow forecasting at seasonal (3 monthly) scale was found to have less uncertainty (>0.3) than at monthly scale (<0.25). The forecast skill in the Brahmaputra basin showed more improvement when the time horizon was aggregated from monthly to seasonal than the Ganges basin. Finally, the skill assessment for the individual seasons revealed that the flow forecasting using NMME data had less uncertainty during monsoon season (July-September) in the Brahmaputra basin and in postmonsoon season (October-December) in the Ganges basin. Overall, the study indicated that GCMs can have value for management decisions only at seasonal or annual water balance applications at best if appropriate historical forcings are used in downscaling. The take-home message of this study is that GCMs are not yet ready for prime-time operationalization for a wide variety of multiscale water management decisions for the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins.

Energy spectra of He-3-rich solar energetic particles associated with coronal waves	15TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ASTROPHYSICS CONFERENCE: "THE SCIENCE OF ED STONE: CELEBRATING HIS 80TH BIRTHDAY"	Journal of Physics Conference Series				15th Annual International Astrophysics Conference - The Science of Ed Stone - Celebrating his 80th Birthday	APR 04-08, 2016	Westin Cape Coral Resort, Cape Coral, FL		Westin Cape Coral Resort			In addition to their anomalous abundances, 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) show puzzling energy spectral shapes varying from rounded forms to power laws where the later are characteristics of shock acceleration. Solar sources of these particles have been often associated with jets and narrow CMEs, which are the signatures of magnetic reconnection involving open field. Recent reports on new associations with large-scale EUV waves bring new insights on acceleration and transport of 3He-rich SEPs in the corona. We examined energy spectra for 32 3He-rich SEP events observed by ACE at Ll near solar minimum in 2007-2010 and compared the spectral shapes with solar flare signatures obtained from STEREO EUV images. We found the events with jets or brightenings tend to be associated with rounded spectra and the events with coronal waves with power laws. This suggests that coronal waves may be related to the unknown second stage mechanism commonly used to interpret spectral forms of 3He-rich SEPs.

Such observations will enable improvement in cloud and moisture simulations in global climate models as well as precipitation forecasts on a global basis. Measurements at a range of frequencies in the millimeter- and submillimeter-wave frequency range provide sensitivity to ice particle size distribution in the range of tens to hundreds of micrometers. To perform this measurement on a global basis, a new millimeter- and submillimeter-wave instrument is currently under development with suitable mass, power and volume to be deployed on 6U-Class nanosatellites. To achieve miniaturized receivers in this frequency range, InP MMIC technology has been scaled to 25-nm gate length transistors, enabling demonstration of low-noise amplifiers with sufficient gain at frequencies up to 1 THz. This technology is being applied to develop direct-detection submillimeter-wave receivers at 240 GHz, 310 GHz and 670 GHz. InP MMIC technology has also enabled multipliers for local oscillators and subharmonic mixers for temperature and humidity sounding channels near atmospheric absorption lines at 118.75, 183.31 and 380.20 GHz.																	2162-2027		978-1-4673-8485-8				2016																	WOS:000391406200058

Subharmonic MMIC mixers were also developed using United Monolithic Semiconductor's GaAs Schottky diode process, and cover V-band with 15-21 dB conversion loss. These components form the front end of receivers that could be used for radio astronomy.

Identification of rare minerals in high spatial and spectral resolution Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) visible/shortwave infrared (VSWIR) images has been a challenge due to the presence of both additive and multiplicative noise and other artifacts, affecting all collected images, in addition to the limited spatial extent of regions hosting these minerals. In an effort to automate this task we evaluate various clustering algorithms using the detection of rare jarosite, associated with spectrally similar minerals in CRISM imagery, as a case study. We compare non-parametric Bayesian and standard clustering algorithms and show that a recently developed doubly non-parametric Bayesian model could be effective for this task.				Dundar, M.

Our goal in this work is both to explore the emerging capabilities of microimaging VSWIR spectroscopy and to contribute to understanding the petrologic diversity of the HED suite and the evolution of Vesta. Using a combination of manual and automated hyperspectral classification techniques, we identify four major classes of materials based on VSWIR absorptions that include pyroxene, olivine, Febearing feldspars, and glass-bearing/featureless materials. Results show microimaging spectroscopy is an effective method for rapidly and non-destructively characterizing small compositional variations of meteorite samples and for locating rare phases for possible follow-up investigation. Future work will include incorporating SEM/EDS results to quantify sources of spectral variability and placing observations within a broader geologic framework of the differentiation and evolution of Vesta.

Here we used a prototype instrument to image serpentinized igneous rocks and carbonate-rich travertine deposits to evaluate performance, relative to traditional techniques: XRD (mineralogical analysis of bulk powders with no texture preservation) and SEM/EDS (analysis of phases and textures using chemical data from polished thin sections). VSWIR microimaging spectroscopy is ideal for identifying spatially coherent rare phases, below XRD detection limits. The progress of alteration can also be inferred from spectral parameters and may correspond to phases that are amorphous in XRD. However, VSWIR microimaging spectroscopy can sometimes be challenging with analyses of very dark materials (reflectance < 0.05) and mineral mixtures occurring at a spatial scales multiple factors below the pixel size. Abundances derived from linear unmixing typically agree with those from XRD and EDS within similar to 10%.																			978-1-5090-0608-3				2016																	WOS:000425944200119

Synchrotron emission generated by ultra-relativistic electrons trapped in Jupiter's magnetosphere will be detected and measured by the MWR Radiometer over a range of wavelengths from 2 cm to 50 cm. Synchrotron data collected with the MWR Radiometer will be used for two purposes: a) to improve the atmospheric measurements, and b) to provide new constraints on the synchrotron emission itself. The ancillary MWR data analysis requires a fast synchrotron radiation model that can be used in conjunction with the atmospheric retrieval algorithm. This paper describes an extension of the Levin at al. (2001) multi-zonal, multi-parameter model to a spacecraft point of view, along with a few testing and validation cases.

Within the PPU, the Anode Power Supply (APS) module is a 10kW modular power stage and is the key to the HTB PPU. This paper is to present the design, development, fabrication, testing and thermal demonstration of the 10kW HTB APS. The system architecture and the paradigm shift of the HTB PPU is also to be described. In addition, the extreme environments electronic and packaging technologies are addressed as the fundamental technology path. The HTB PPU is intended for power processing in the area of space solar electric propulsion, where reduction of in-space mass and volume are desired, and sometimes even critical, to achieve the goals of future space flight missions. The concept of the HTB PPU can also be applied to other extreme environment applications, such as geothermal and petroleum deep-well drilling, where higher temperature operation is required.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374904008

This paper details the ongoing development of a modular dual-band active antenna tile, with the primary intended use in airborne and small platform space applications for radar remote sensing. A secondary objective is to develop the modular tile, such that it will be used as the basis for a building block required for a future spaceborne instrument, reducing instrument cost and mission risk. The actual development of such a spaceborne mission is likely + 10 years out, so we are focusing current efforts on developing this technology to fill the science gap, while the community waits for the more global coverage of an orbiting instrument. An airborne instrument is an asset regardless of an orbital instrument, as evidenced by the success of UAVSAR.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374904035

For example, Mars rovers can enhance localization accuracy by selectively driving over feature-rich terrain where visual odometry can be used. In general, having an accurate localization is vital for autonomous mobile exploration platforms such as rovers and aerial vehicles. However, typical path planning methods tend to narrowly focus on minimizing path length. Our proposed path planning algorithm, namely Error Propagation A*(EPA*), intelligently balances path length and localization. EPA* is a graph search algorithm, where a linear error propagation law is derived before the search on each edge of the graph. Using the propagation law, EPA* can quickly find a path that minimizes a given objective function, which includes both path length and error covariance. We demonstrate the EPA* algorithm using the real data from Curiosity. The result demonstrates that the EPA* algorithm can find a path that balances the path length and the expected localization error, as expected.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374901008

Small Areostationary Telecommunications Orbiter Concepts for Mars in the 2020s	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings				IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Current Mars science orbiters carry UHF proximity payloads to provide limited access and data services to landers and rovers on Mars surface. In the era of human spaceflight to Mars, very high rate and reliable relay services will be needed to serve a large number of supporting vehicles, habitats, and orbiters, as well as astronaut EVAs. These will likely be provided by a robust network of orbiting assets in very high orbits, such as areostationary orbits. In the decade leading to that era, telecommunications orbiters can be operated at areostationary orbit that can support a significant population of robotic precursor missions and build the network capabilities needed for the human spaceflight era. Telecommunications orbiters of modest size and cost, delivered by Solar Electric Propulsion to areostationary orbit, can provide continuous access at very high data rates to users on the surface and in Mars orbit.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374904020

Potential Cislunar and Interplanetary Proving Ground Excursion Trajectory Concepts	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings				IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA has been investigating potential translunar excursion concepts to take place in the 2020s that would be used to test and demonstrate long duration life support and other systems needed for eventual Mars missions in the 2030s. These potential trajectory concepts could be conducted in the proving ground, a region of cislunar and near-Earth interplanetary space where international space agencies could cooperate to develop the technologies needed for interplanetary spaceflight. Enabled by high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) technologies, the excursion trajectory concepts studied are grouped into three classes of increasing distance from the Earth and increaseing technical difficulty: the first class of excursion trajectory concepts would represent a 90-120 day round trip trajectory with abort to Earth options throughout the entire length, the second class would be a 180-210 day round trip trajectory with periods in which aborts would not be available, and the third would be a 300-400 day round trip trajectory without aborts for most of the length of the trip. This paper provides a top-level summary of the trajectory and mission design of representative example missions of these three classes of excursion trajectory concepts.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374901089

To overcome some of these barriers, a modular " chiplet" motif is proposed around which a scalable and heterogeneous architecture multi-generational roadmap for microelectronics can be based that preserves many of the benefits of a SoC approach. A chiplet is defined as a small, high-performance nodal architecture that can be connected to other chiplets using a number of universal links for high-speed communications. The links can be either parallel or serial, each conveying the same information. Parallel links are used in multichip module / 2.5D packaging, in which a number of chiplets may be a packaged into a tightly coupled configuration (having in theory thousands of interconnects). Serial links are used in simpler forms of packaging to connect nodes across boards, backplanes, and boxes. The universality is important for two reasons. First, by establishing an equivalence between parallel and serial links, the same grouping of chips can be packaged in several different ways that result in functionally equivalent implementations (except that the inter-nodal latency will vary between parallel and serial connections). The performance of the links can be evolved over time to take advantage of the fastest available transport (including optical) or the widest parallel embodiments (for aggressive 3-D throughsilicon via connections). Second, since the links only pass information, it is conceivable that node designs can be substantially different, allowing heterogeneous mixtures of chiplets, to include not only different embodiments of the same processor, but also wholly different classes of node types, to include ultradense memory " servers" (capable of managing multiple high-speed streams through the same link mechanisms), field programmable gate array (FPGA) clusters, and even extended to include complex, configurable analog and radiofrequency functional blocks in the future. By establishing standard messaging protocols, node arrangements can selforganize as more copies of different node types are added, creating a natural approach for building systems flexibly based on the best of breed semiconductor and packaging technologies. This paper will introduce the basic form of the chiplet concept inspired from joint AFRL/NASA work on next-generation space processing and previous work on scaled reconfigurable processing architectures, and describe some of the features we believe necessary to support scalability and heterogeneity with semiconductor technologies, transport concepts, and advanced packaging approaches.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374903052

Apollo Program experience warns that opening an EVA hatch directly to the surface will bring dust into the ascent vehicle. To prevent inadvertent return of potential Martian contaminants to Earth, careful consideration must be given to the way in which crew ingress their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). For architectures involving more than one surface element-such as an ascent vehicle and a pressurized rover or surface habitat-a retractable tunnel that eliminates extravehicular activity (EVA) ingress is an attractive solution. Beyond addressing the immediate MAV access issue, a reusable tunnel may be useful for other surface applications, such as rover to habitat transfer, once its primary mission is complete. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) team is studying the optimal balance between surface tunnel functionality, mass, and stowed volume as part of the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC). The study team began by identifying the minimum set of functional requirements needed for the tunnel to perform its primary mission, as this would presumably be the simplest design, with the lowest mass and volume. This Minimum Functional Tunnel then becomes a baseline against which various tunnel design concepts and potential alternatives can be traded, and aids in assessing the mass penalty of increased functionality. Preliminary analysis indicates that the mass of a single-mission tunnel is about 237 kg, not including mass growth allowance.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374903003

An ion propulsion system based on these developments has been considered for many SEP technology demonstration missions, including the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) concept. These studies and the high-power SEP technology developments have generated excitement within NASA about the use of the ARRM ion propulsion system design for other types of potential missions. One application of interest is for Mars missions, especially with the types of orbiters now under consideration for flights in the early 2020's to replace the aging Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. High-power SEP can deliver large payloads to Mars with many additional capabilities, including large orbital plane changes and round-trip missions, compared to chemically-propelled spacecraft. Another application for high-power SEP is for exo-planet observation missions, where a large starshade spacecraft would need to be repositioned with respect to its companion telescope relatively frequently and rapidly. SEP is an enabling technology for the ambitious science goals of these types of missions. This paper will discuss the benefits of high-power SEP for these concepts based on the STMD technologies now under development.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374903094

At its core is a novel high-resolution imaging spectrometer that records solar reflected light between 1.99 and 2.42 mu m at 1 nm resolution, including strong methane (CH4) bands in the short-wave infrared. The push-broom spectrometer will leverage recent advancements in grating design and large-format 2D focal plane arrays to enable-for the first time-the high spectral resolution necessary for trace gas retrievals combined with high-performance imaging capabilities developed for surface remote sensing. AMPS features a 36 degrees field of view with 600 resolved spatial elements across track (1 mRad) and 431 pixels in the spectral dimension. All other aspects of the instrument, such as the telescope, cryo-cooler, image stabilizer, GPS, are identical to available airborne JPL spectrometers in operation. The AMPS design is based on the next generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG), which has been used for high resolution mapping of CH4 concentrations from a controlled release experiment [1] and over existing natural gas fields [2]. A real time CH4 plume detection capability originally developed for AVIRIS-NG and successfully demonstrated over oil fields [3] will also be implemented with AMPS. This will facilitate surveys over existing oil and gas fields to identify and attribute CH4 emissions to individual point source locations, permit adaptive surveys with repeat imaging of suspected sources, and allow real time communication to site operators or ground crews equipped with additional instruments to verify observed plumes. AMPS will enable quantitative imaging of CH4 plumes at unprecedented spatial resolution and precision. Using a slow moving platform such as a helicopter at 100 m flight altitude (60 m image swath) will permit imaging CH4 enhancements at 10 cm spatial resolution and an unprecedented accuracy of 0.05 g CH4/m(2). This will allow robust detection of CH4 emissions as low as 0.17 m(3)/h (6 standard cubic feet per hour), an order of magnitude smaller than what current airborne systems can detect. Using fixed-wing aircraft, AMPS can also be flown faster and higher (1 to 8 km flight altitude), thereby providing larger image swaths (0.6 to 4.8 km swaths respectively) and effective large scale surveys. Mapping CH4 emissions to individual point source locations could allow site operators to identify and mitigate these emissions, which reflect both a potential safety hazard and lost revenue. For the regulatory and scientific communities, understanding the distribution (spatial, temporal) and size of these emissions is of interest given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic emissions, including industrial point source emissions and fugitive CH4 from oil and gas infrastructure.

In this mission concept, the spacecraft would perform touch-and-go maneuver at a small body to collect a comet surface sample. Immediately after the sample is captured the FiSI would perform in situ verification of the comet sample. Sample volume would be estimated and images of the collected sample acquired and evaluated. If the captured sample volume were deemed insufficient, the sample collection maneuver would be re-attempted, multiple times if necessary, until a baseline sample volume was positively confirmed. This repeatability would improve the potential science outcome of the sample return mission. Our proof-of-concept FiSI hardware consists of nine imaging fiberscopes integrated into a single bundle. The nine fiberscopes are designed to provide wide swath coverage of overlapping fields of view within a sample measurement station. The achieved image resolution is in excess of 4 linepair/mm at 20 mm working distance. Surface color and texture of a comet sample simulant would clearly be discernible at this fidelity. The distal end of these fiberscopes are designed to tolerate harsh temperature and radiation environments near a comet while sensitive electronics and optical components at the proximal end can be placed in a more benign electronics bay of the notional spacecraft. An early FiSI prototype was tested in a -50 degrees C chamber and showed no image degradation. To study the FiSI proof-of-concept system response in a microgravity-like environment, a preliminary experiment was attempted using a neutral buoyancy sample. The test result was consistent with Monte Carlo simulation.																	1095-323X		978-1-4673-7676-1				2016																	WOS:000388374902031

To meet this goal, the RPS Program, working closely with the Department of Energy, performs mission and system studies (such as the recently released Nuclear Power Assessment Study), assesses the readiness of promising technologies to infuse in future generators, assesses the sustainment of key RPS capabilities and knowledge, forecasts and tracks the Program's budgetary needs, and disseminates current information about RPS to the community of potential users. This process has been refined and used to determine the current content of the RPS Program's portfolio. This portfolio currently includes an effort to mature advanced thermoelectric technology for possible integration into an enhanced Multi-Mission Radioisotope Generator (eMMRTG), sustainment and production of the currently deployed MMRTG, and technology investments that could lead to a future Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG).

The SMAP radiometer began acquiring routine science data on March 31, 2015 and continues to operate nominally. SMAP's radiometer-derived soil moisture product (L2_SM_P) provides soil moisture estimates posted on a 36 km fixed Earth grid using brightness temperature observations from descending (6 am) passes and ancillary data. A beta quality version of L2_SM_P was released to the public in September, 2015, with the fully validated L2_SM_P soil moisture data expected to be released in May, 2016. Additional improvements (including optimization of retrieval algorithm parameters and upscaling approaches) and methodology expansions (including increasing the number of core sites, model-based intercomparisons, and results from several intensive field campaigns) are anticipated in moving from accuracy assessment of the beta quality data to an evaluation of the fully validated L2_SM_P data product.

In this paper, we propose a novel low rank anomaly detection algorithm in hyperspectral images (HSI), where three components are involved. First, due to the highly mixed nature of pixels in HSI, instead of using the raw pixel directly for anomaly detection, the proposed algorithm applies spectral unmixing algorithms to obtain the abundance vectors and uses these vectors for anomaly detection. Second, for better classification, a dictionary is built based on the mean-shift clustering of the abundance vectors to better represent the highly-correlated background and the sparse anomaly. Finally, a low-rank matrix decomposition is proposed to encourage the sparse coefficients of the dictionary to be low-rank, and the residual matrix to be sparse. Anomalies can then be extracted by summing up the columns of the residual matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach constantly achieves high detection rate while maintaining low false alarm rate regardless of the type of images tested.

In this study, we aim to separate the decorrelation caused by natural changes from the one caused by the major event by analyzing the coherence behavior using a temporal decorrelation model. We formulated the temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion and dielectric changes. By applying the model into the multi-temporal coherence before the event, we extracted the temporal decorrelation components induced by natural phenomena. Based on the extracted parameters, their decorrelation probabilities related to natural changes were estimated in canopy and ground. The model parameters are also extracted from the interferometric SAR data acquired across the event. We compared probabilities between the natural phenomena and the certain event in order to assign the changed regions. Pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 80% are selected as changed due to the event. A case study for detecting volcanic ash during the eruption of the Shinmoedake volcano in January 2011 was carried out using L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR data.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-3332-4				2016							3394	3397		10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729877							WOS:000388114603104

That was largely based on a syntheticaperture concept then under development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). At the time the required technology was not perceived as being sufficiently mature, and PATH was therefore put in the "third tier" group of missions. Now, under the NASA Earth Science Technology Office's (ESTO) Instrument Incubator Program (IIP), the key technology has been developed and has been brought to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, required for mission implementation, thus enabling the PATH mission.

As the inherent material limitations of Si devices are being swiftly realized, wide-bandgap (WBG) materials such as SiC have become increasingly attractive for high power applications. In particular, SiC power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors' (MOSFETs) high breakdown field tolerance, superior thermal conductivity and low-resistivity drift regions make these devices an excellent candidate for power dense, low loss, high frequency switching applications in extreme environment conditions. In this paper, a novel power processing unit (PPU) architecture is proposed utilizing commercially available 4H-SiC power MOSFETs from CREE Inc. A multiphase straight boost converter topology is implemented to supply up to 10 kW full-scale. High Temperature Gate Bias (HTGB) and High Temperature Reverse Bias (HTRB) characterization is performed to evaluate the long-term reliability of both the gate oxide and the body diode of the SiC components. Finally, susceptibility of the CREE SiC MOSFETs to damaging effects from heavy-ion radiation representative of the on-orbit galactic cosmic ray environment are explored. The results provide the baseline performance metrics of operation as well as demonstrate the feasibility of a hard-switched PPU in harsh environments.																	1541-7026		978-1-4673-9136-8				2016																	WOS:000387121900107

We have targeted the WR4 (170-260 GHz) and WR3 (220-325 GHz) waveguide bands for the module development. The modules include two different methods of E-plane probes which have been developed for low loss, and stability at high frequencies. MMIC LNAs were also developed for these frequency ranges and fabricated in Northrop Grumman Corporation's 35 nm InP HEMT technology, and we have experimentally verified that noise performance is lower than reported in prior work. The best results include a miniature LNA module with 550K noise at 224 GHz, and a wideband LNA module with 15 dB gain from 230-280 GHz.																	0149-645X	2576-7216	978-1-5090-0698-4				2016																	WOS:000390313200221

It is the first ever RF MEMS switch reported to be operating above 220 GHz. The switch is based on a MEMS-reconfigurable surface which can block the wave propagation in the waveguide by short-circuiting the electrical field lines of the TE10 mode. The switch is designed for optimized isolation in the blocking state and for optimized insertion loss in the non-blocking state. The measurement results of the first prototypes show better than 15 dB isolation in the blocking state and better than 3 dB insertion loss in the non-blocking state for 500-750 GHz. The higher insertion loss is mainly attributed to the insufficient metal thickness and surface roughness on the waveguide sidewalls. Two switch designs with different number of blocking elements are fabricated and compared. The overall switch bandwidth is limited by the waveguide only and not by the switch technology itself.

Studying these clouds can potentially lead to a better understanding of the dense clouds seen in the central starburst regions in nearby galaxies or in the early universe. The clouds share an unusual feature: they form stars at an unusually slow rate compared to other Milky Way clouds of similar mass and density. Here we use interferometer data from ALMA and the SMA to show that this reduced star formation rate is a consequence of the cloud density structure: CMZ clouds have unusually flat density slopes. The clouds do, for example, exceed the average density of the Orion A molecular cloud by an order of magnitude on spatial scales similar to 5 pc, but the cores of CMZ clouds with similar to 0.1 pc radius often have masses and densities lower than what is found in the Orion KL region. This relative absence of highest-density gas probably explains the suppression of star formation. The clouds are relatively turbulent, and ALMA observations of H2CO and SiO indicate that the turbulence is induced by high-velocity shocks. We speculate that these shocks might prevent the formation of high-mass cores.

It offers high Strehl ratios at near-IR wavelengths (y-K band) with stable pointing and coronagraphs with extremely small inner working angles, optimized for imaging faint companions very close to the host. In the visible, it has several interferometric imagers which offer polarimetric and spectroscopic capabilities. A recent addition is the RHEA spectrograph enabling spatially resolved high resolution spectroscopy of the surfaces of giant stars, for example. New capabilities on the horizon include post-coronagraphic spectroscopy, spectral differential imaging, nulling interferometry as well as an integral field spectrograph and an MKID array. Here we present the new modules of SCExAO, give an overview of the current commissioning status of each of the modules and present preliminary results.

A Method to Assess Localized Impact of Better Floodplain Topography on Flood Risk Prediction	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Many studies have highlighted the need for a higher accuracy global digital elevation model (DEM), mainly in river floodplains and deltas and along coastlines. In this paper, we present a method to infer the impact of a better DEM on applications and science using the Lower Zambezi basin as a use case. We propose an analysis based on a targeted observation algorithm to evaluate potential data acquisition subregions in terms of their impact on the prediction of flood risk over the entire study area. Consequently, it becomes trivial to rank these subregions in terms of their contribution to the overall accuracy of flood prediction. The improvement from better topography data may be expressed in terms of economic output and population affected, providing a multifaceted assessment of the value of acquiring better elevation data. Our results highlight the notion that having higher resolution measurements would improve our current large-scale flood inundation prediction capabilities in the Lower Zambezi by at least 30% and significantly reduce the number of people affected as well as the economic loss associated with high magnitude flooding. We believe this procedure to be simple enough to be applied to other regions where high quality topographic and hydrodynamic data are currently unavailable.

Process improvements in the production of silicon immersion gratings	ADVANCES IN OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION II	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Advances in Optical and Mechanical Technologies for Telescopes and Instrumentation II	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, UNITED KINGDOM	SPIE				We have explored a number of lithographic techniques and improvements to produce the resist lines that then define the grating groove edges of silicon immersion gratings. In addition to our lithographic process using contact printing with photomasks, which is our primary technique for the production of immersion gratings, we explored two alternative fabrication methods, direct-write electron beam and photo-lithography. We have investigated the application of antireflection (AR) coatings during our contact printing lithography method to reduce the effect of Fizeau fringes produced by the contact of the photomask on the photoresist surface. This AR coating reduces the amplitude of the periodic errors by a factor of 1.5. Electron beam (e-beam) patterning allows us to manufacture gratings that can be used in first order, with groove spacing down to 0.5 micrometer or smaller (2,000 grooves/mm), but could require significant e-beam write times of up to one week to pattern a full-sized grating. The University of Texas at Austin silicon diffractive optics group is working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop an alternate e-beam method that employs chromium liftoff to reduce the write time by a factor of 10. We are working with the National Institute of Standards and Technology using laser writing to explore the possibility of creating very high quality gratings without the errors introduced during the contact-printing step. Both e-beam and laser patterning bypass the contact photolithography step and directly write the lines in photoresist on our silicon substrates, but require increased cost, time, and process complexity.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0203-8; 978-1-5106-0204-5				2016	9912		1						UNSP 99123Z	10.1117/12.2233388							WOS:000387747900120

The ideal performance and complexity of the optical systems depends strongly on the shape of the telescope aperture. Unfortunately, large primary mirrors tend to be segmented and have various obstructions, which limit the performance of most conventional coronagraph designs. We present a new family of vortex coronagraphs with numerically-optimized gray-scale apodizers that provide the sensitivity needed to directly image faint exoplanets with large, segmented aperture telescopes, including the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) as well as potential next-generation space telescopes.

Whilst orbiting in the close vicinity of the nucleus the ROSETTA magnetometers detected a new type of low-frequency wave possibly generated by a cross-field current instability due to freshly ionized cometary water group particles. During separation, descent and landing of the lander PHILAE on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we used the unique opportunity to perform combined measurements with the magnetometers onboard ROSETTA (RPCMAG) and its lander PHILAE (ROMAP). New details about the spatial distribution of wave properties along the connection line of the ROSETTA orbiter and the lander PHILAE are revealed. An estimation of the observed amplitude, phase and wavelength distribution will be presented as well as the measured dispersion relation, characterizing the new type of low-frequency waves. The propagation direction and polarization features will be discussed using the results of a minimum variance analysis. Thoughts about the size of the wave source will complete our study.				tsurutani, bruce/G-5835-2019; Heinisch, Philip/X-8325-2019	tsurutani, bruce/0000-0001-7299-9835; Heinisch, Philip/0000-0003-1873-3598; Carr, Chris/0000-0002-6879-3970												0992-7689	1432-0576					2016	34	7					609	622		10.5194/angeo-34-609-2016							WOS:000381097000004

We identify 5065 glaciers covering a planimetric area of 2326 +/- 186 km(2), most of which is located in the Altai mountain subregion. The total glacier count is 15% higher, but the total glacier area is 32 +/- 11.6% lower, than the estimated glacier coverage provided in version 4.0 of the Randolph Glacier Inventory. We investigate the distribution of glacier size within North Asia and find that the majority of glaciers (82%) are smaller than 0.5km(2) but only account for a third of the total glacier area, with the largest 1% (60 glaciers >= 5km(2)) accounting for 28% of the total area. We present hypsometric characterizations of North Asian glaciers, largely substantiating existing findings that glaciers in this region are dominated by cold, relatively dry conditions. We provide a detailed assessment of errors and determine the uncertainty in our area estimate to be +/- 8.0%, with snow-cover uncertainty the largest contributing factor. Based on this assessment, the new glacier inventory presented here is more complete and of higher quality than other currently available data sources.

We simulate the spin-orbit dynamics of these systems and map the possible spin configurations of the satellites on surface of section plots. The presence of chaotic regions in the phase space has important consequences for the evolution of binary asteroids. It may substantially increase spin synchronization timescales, delay BYORP-type evolution, and extend the lifetime of binaries.

Linear methods are the fastest approach but their applicability regime is limited because of the chaotic dynamics of near-Earth asteroids. Among nonlinear methods, Monte Carlo algorithms are the most reliable ones but also most computationally intensive and so unpractical for routine impact monitoring. In the last 15 years, the Line of Variations method has been the most successful technique thanks to its computational efficiency and capability of detecting low probability events deep in the nonlinear regime. We also present some more recent techniques developed to deal with the new challenges arising in the impact hazard assessment problem. In particular, we describe keyhole maps as a tool to go beyond strongly scattering encounters and how to account for nongravitational perturbations, especially the Yarkovsky effect, when their contribution is the main source of prediction uncertainty. Finally, we discuss systematic ranging to deal with the short-term hazard assessment problem for newly discovered asteroids, when only a short observed arc is available thus leading to severe degeneracies in the orbit estimation process.																	1743-9213	1743-9221	978-1-10713-825-4				2016	10	318					221	230		10.1017/S1743921315007310							WOS:000455238100031

While most objects do not have sufficient observational data to reveal such slight acceleration, we do identify 42 asteroids with a "valid" detection of the Yarkovsky effect, i.e., those with a signal at least 3 times greater than the formal uncertainty and a value compatible with the Yarkovsky mechanism. We also identify a special category of non-detection, which we refer to as "weak signal," where the objects are of a size that would permit a clear detection if the Yarkovsky effect is maximized, and yet the orbit is clearly incompatible with such accelerations. The implication is that the Yarkovsky effect is reduced in these cases, presumably due to mid-range obliquity, but possibly also due to size, bulk density, thermal inertia, albedo, or spin rate markedly different from assumptions. Finally, there are a number of asteroids showing a significant signal for nongravitational acceleration, and yet with a magnitude too great to be attributed to the Yarkovsky effect. We term these "spurious detections" because most are due to erroneous optical astrometry, often involving a single isolated night from precovery observations. Some cases may be due to other nongravitational accelerations, such as outgassing, mass loss, or micro-meteoroid flux.

THE STRIKINGLY UNIFORM, HIGHLY TURBULENT INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM OF THE MOST LUMINOUS GALAXY IN THE UNIVERSE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS												Observed at z = 4.601 and with L-bol = 3.5 x 10(14) L-circle dot, W2246-0526 is the most luminous galaxy known in the universe. and hosts a deeply buried active galactic nucleus (AGN)/supermassive black hole (SMBH). Discovered using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, W2246-0526 is classified as a hot dust-obscured galaxy, based on its luminosity and dust temperature. Here, we present spatially resolved ALMA [C-II] 157.7 mu m observations of W2246-0526, providing unique insight into the kinematics of its interstellar medium (ISM). The measured [C-II]-to-far-infrared ratio is similar to 2 x 10(-4), implying ISM conditions that compare only with the most obscured, compact starbursts and AGNs in the local universe today. The spatially resolved [C-II] line is strikingly uniform and very broad, 500-600 km s(-1) wide, extending throughout the entire galaxy over about 2.5 kpc, with modest shear. Such a large, homogeneous velocity dispersion indicates a highly turbulent medium. W2246-0526 is unstable in terms of the energy and momentum that are being injected into the ISM, strongly suggesting that the gas is being blown away from the system isotropically, likely reflecting a cathartic state on its road to becoming an unobscured quasar. W2246-0526 provides an extraordinary laboratory to study and model the properties and kinematics of gas in an extreme environment under strong feedback, at a time when the universe was 1/10 of its current age: a system pushing the limits that can be reached during galaxy formation.

I. DISCOVERY OF AN EXTREMELY YOUNG CLASS 0 PROTOSTELLAR OBJECT AND A PROTO-BROWN DWARF CANDIDATE IN THE BRIGHT-RIMMED CLUMP PGCC G192.32-11.88	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES												We are performing a series of observations with ground-based telescopes toward Planck Galactic cold clumps (PGCCs) in the lambda Orionis complex in order to systematically investigate the effects of stellar feedback. In the particular case of PGCC G192.32-11.88, we discovered an extremely young Class 0 protostellar object (G192N) and a proto-brown dwarf candidate (G192S). G192N and G192S are located in a gravitationally bound brightrimmed clump. The velocity and temperature gradients seen in line emission of CO isotopologues indicate that PGCC G192.32-11.88 is externally heated and compressed. G192N probably has the lowest bolometric luminosity (similar to 0.8 L-circle dot) and accretion rate (6.3 x 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1)) when compared with other young Class 0 sources (e.g., PACS Bright Red Sources) in the Orion complex. It has slightly larger internal luminosity (0.21 +/- 0.01 L-circle dot) and outflow velocity (similar to 14 km s(-1)) than the predictions of first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs). G192N might be among the youngest Class 0 sources, which are slightly more evolved than an FHSC. Considering its low internal luminosity (0.08 +/- 0.01 L-circle dot) and accretion rate (2.8 x 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1)), G192S is an ideal proto-brown dwarf candidate. The star formation efficiency (similar to 0.3%-0.4%) and core formation efficiency (similar to 1%) in PGCC G192.32-11.88 are significantly smaller than in other giant molecular clouds or filaments, indicating that the star formation therein is greatly suppressed owing to stellar feedback.

Our study aims to provide a guide to cirrus microphysics, which is compiled from an extensive set of model simulations, covering the broad range of atmospheric conditions for cirrus formation and evolution. The model results are portrayed in the same parameter space as field measurements, i.e., in the Ice Water Content-Temperature (IWC-T) parameter space. We validate this cirrus analysis approach by evaluating cirrus data sets from 17 aircraft campaigns, conducted in the last 15 years, spending about 94 h in cirrus over Europe, Australia, Brazil as well as South and North America. Altogether, the approach of this study is to track cirrus IWC development with temperature by means of model simulations, compare with observations and then assign, to a certain degree, cirrus microphysics to the observations. Indeed, the field observations show characteristics expected from the simulated Cirrus Guide. For example, high (low) IWCs are found together with high (low) ice crystal concentrations N-ice. An important finding from our study is the classification of two types of cirrus with differing formation mechanisms and microphysical properties: the first cirrus type forms directly as ice (in situ origin cirrus) and splits in two subclasses, depending on the prevailing strength of the updraft: in slow updrafts these cirrus are rather thin with lower IWCs, while in fast updrafts thicker cirrus with higher IWCs can form. The second type consists predominantly of thick cirrus originating from mixed phase clouds (i.e., via freezing of liquid droplets - liquid origin cirrus), which are completely glaciated while lifting to the cirrus formation temperature region (< 235 K). In the European field campaigns, slow updraft in situ origin cirrus occur frequently in low- and high-pressure systems, while fast updraft in situ cirrus appear in conjunction with jet streams or gravity waves. Also, liquid origin cirrus mostly related to warm conveyor belts are found. In the US and tropical campaigns, thick liquid origin cirrus which are formed in large convective systems are detected more frequently.

Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying feedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold meltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and heat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface cooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the Southern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation, and increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact with the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that ice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level several meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear response. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise in about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the lower end of the 10-40-year range, but the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help explain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in controlling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global temperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000-year) timescale of deep-ocean ventilation affects the timescale for natural CO2 change and thus the timescale for paleo-global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this paleo-millennial timescale should not be misinterpreted as the timescale for ice sheet response to a rapid, large, human-made climate forcing. These climate feedbacks aid interpretation of events late in the prior interglacial, when sea level rose to +6-9 m with evidence of extreme storms while Earth was less than 1 A degrees C warmer than today. Ice melt cooling of the North Atlantic and Southern oceans increases atmospheric temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, thus driving more powerful storms. The modeling, paleoclimate evidence, and ongoing observations together imply that 2 A degrees C global warming above the preindustrial level could be dangerous. Continued high fossil fuel emissions this century are predicted to yield (1) cooling of the Southern Ocean, especially in the Western Hemisphere; (2) slowing of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, warming of the ice shelves, and growing ice sheet mass loss; (3) slowdown and eventual shutdown of the Atlantic overturning circulation with cooling of the North Atlantic region; (4) increasingly powerful storms; and (5) nonlinearly growing sea level rise, reaching several meters over a timescale of 50-150 years. These predictions, especially the cooling in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic with markedly reduced warming or even cooling in Europe, differ fundamentally from existing climate change assessments. We discuss observations and modeling studies needed to refute or clarify these assertions.

Investigating Alaskan methane and carbon dioxide fluxes using measurements from the CARVE tower	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Northern high-latitude carbon sources and sinks, including those resulting from degrading permafrost, are thought to be sensitive to the rapidly warming climate. Because the near-surface atmosphere integrates surface fluxes over large ( aEuro-500-1000aEuro-km) scales, atmospheric monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) mole fractions in the daytime mixed layer is a promising method for detecting change in the carbon cycle throughout boreal Alaska. Here we use CO2 and CH4 measurements from a NOAA tower 17aEuro-km north of Fairbanks, AK, established as part of NASA's Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE), to investigate regional fluxes of CO2 and CH4 for 2012-2014. CARVE was designed to use aircraft and surface observations to better understand and quantify the sensitivity of Alaskan carbon fluxes to climate variability. We use high-resolution meteorological fields from the Polar Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model (hereafter, WRF-STILT), along with the Polar Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (PolarVPRM), to investigate fluxes of CO2 in boreal Alaska using the tower observations, which are sensitive to large areas of central Alaska. We show that simulated PolarVPRM-WRF-STILT CO2 mole fractions show remarkably good agreement with tower observations, suggesting that the WRF-STILT model represents the meteorology of the region quite well, and that the PolarVPRM flux magnitudes and spatial distribution are generally consistent with CO2 mole fractions observed at the CARVE tower. One exception to this good agreement is that during the fall of all 3 years, PolarVPRM cannot reproduce the observed CO2 respiration. Using the WRF-STILT model, we find that average CH4 fluxes in boreal Alaska are somewhat lower than flux estimates by Chang et al. (2014) over all of Alaska for May-September 2012; we also find that enhancements appear to persist during some wintertime periods, augmenting those observed during the summer and fall. The possibility of significant fall and winter CO2 and CH4 fluxes underscores the need for year-round in situ observations to quantify changes in boreal Alaskan annual carbon balance.

In order to obtain added value from space-borne measurements, they have to suffice stringent accuracy and precision requirements, with the latter being less crucial as it can be reduced by just enhanced sample size. Validation of CO2 column-averaged dry air mole fractions (XCO2) heavily relies on measurements of the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Owing to the sparseness of the network and the requirements imposed on space-based measurements, independent additional validation is highly valuable. Here, we use observations from the High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) flights from 01/2009 through 09/2011 to validate CO2 measurements from satellites (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite - GOSAT, Thermal Emission Sounder - TES, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder - AIRS) and atmospheric inversion models (CarbonTracker CT2013B, Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) v13r1). We find that the atmospheric models capture the XCO2 variability observed in HIPPO flights very well, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) of 0.93 and 0.95 for CT2013B and MACC, respectively. Some larger discrepancies can be observed in profile comparisons at higher latitudes, in particular at 300aEuro-hPa during the peaks of either carbon uptake or release. These deviations can be up to 4aEuro-ppm and hint at misrepresentation of vertical transport. Comparisons with the GOSAT satellite are of comparable quality, with an r(2) of 0.85, a mean bias mu of -0.06aEuro-ppm, and a standard deviation sigma of 0.45aEuro-ppm. TES exhibits an r(2) of 0.75, mu of 0.34aEuro-ppm, and sigma of 1.13aEuro-ppm. For AIRS, we find an r(2) of 0.37, mu of 1.11aEuro-ppm, and sigma of 1.46aEuro-ppm, with latitude-dependent biases. For these comparisons at least 6, 20, and 50 atmospheric soundings have been averaged for GOSAT, TES, and AIRS, respectively. Overall, we find that GOSAT soundings over the remote Pacific Ocean mostly meet the stringent accuracy requirements of about 0.5aEuro-ppm for space-based CO2 observations.

Harmonizing satellite CO2 measurements is particularly important since the differences in instruments, observing geometries, sampling strategies, etc. imbue different measurement characteristics in the various satellite CO2 data products. We focus on validating model and satellite observation attributes that impact flux estimates and CO2 assimilation, including accurate error estimates, correlated and random errors, overall biases, biases by season and latitude, the impact of coincidence criteria, validation of seasonal cycle phase and amplitude, yearly growth, and daily variability. We evaluate dry-air mole fraction (X-CO2) for Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) (Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space, ACOS b3.5) and SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) (Bremen Optimal Estimation DOAS, BESD v2.00.08) as well as the CarbonTracker (CT2013b) simulated CO2 mole fraction fields and the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) CO2 inversion system (v13.1) and compare these to Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) observations (GGG2012/2014). We find standard deviations of 0.9, 0.9, 1.7, and 2.1 ppm vs. TCCON for CT2013b, MACC, GOSAT, and SCIAMACHY, respectively, with the single observation errors 1.9 and 0.9 times the predicted errors for GOSAT and SCIAMACHY, respectively. We quantify how satellite error drops with data averaging by interpreting according to error(2) = a(2) + b(2) / n (with n being the number of observations averaged, a the systematic (correlated) errors, and b the random (uncorrelated) errors). a and b are estimated by satellites, coincidence criteria, and hemisphere. Biases at individual stations have year-to-year variability of similar to 0.3 ppm, with biases larger than the TCCON-predicted bias uncertainty of 0.4 ppm at many stations. We find that GOSAT and CT2013b underpredict the seasonal cycle amplitude in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) between 46 and 53 degrees N, MACC overpredicts between 26 and 37 ffi N, and CT2013b underpredicts the seasonal cycle amplitude in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). The seasonal cycle phase indicates whether a data set or model lags another data set in time. We find that the GOSAT measurements improve the seasonal cycle phase substantially over the prior while SCIAMACHY measurements improve the phase significantly for just two of seven sites. The models reproduce the measured seasonal cycle phase well except for at Lauder_125HR (CT2013b) and Darwin (MACC). We compare the variability within 1 day between TCCON and models in JJA; there is correlation between 0.2 and 0.8 in the NH, with models showing 10-50% the variability of TCCON at different stations and CT2013b showing more variability than MACC. This paper highlights findings that provide inputs to estimate flux errors in model assimilations, and places where models and satellites need further investigation, e.g., the SH for models and 4567 ffi N for GOSAT and CT2013b.

Within two dedicated campaigns and five single-site intercomparison activities, 21 EARLINET systems from 18 EARLINET stations were intercompared between 2009 and 2013. A comprehensive strategy for campaign setup and data evaluation has been established. Eleven systems from nine EARLINET stations participated in the EARLINET Lidar Intercomparison 2009 (EARLI09). In this campaign, three reference systems were qualified which served as traveling standards thereafter. EARLINET systems from nine other stations have been compared against these reference systems since 2009. We present and discuss comparisons at signal and at product level from all campaigns for more than 100 individual measurement channels at the wavelengths of 355, 387, 532, and 607 nm. It is shown that in most cases, a very good agreement of the compared systems with the respective reference is obtained. Mean signal deviations in predefined height ranges are typically below +/- 2 %. Particle backscatter and extinction coefficients agree within +/- 2 x 10(-4) km(-1) sr(-1) and +/- 0.01 km(-1), respectively, in most cases. For systems or channels that showed larger discrepancies, an in-depth analysis of deficiencies was performed and technical solutions and upgrades were proposed and realized. The intercomparisons have reinforced confidence in the EARLINET data quality and allowed us to draw conclusions on necessary system improvements for some instruments and to identify major challenges that need to be tackled in the future.

Ground-based assessment of the bias and long-term stability of 14 limb and occultation ozone profile data records	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												The ozone profile records of a large number of limb and occultation satellite instruments are widely used to address several key questions in ozone research. Further progress in some domains depends on a more detailed understanding of these data sets, especially of their long-term stability and their mutual consistency. To this end, we made a systematic assessment of 14 limb and occultation sounders that, together, provide more than three decades of global ozone profile measurements. In particular, we considered the latest operational Level-2 records by SAGE II, SAGE III, HALOE, UARS MLS, Aura MLS, POAM II, POAM III, OSIRIS, SMR, GOMOS, MIPAS, SCIAMACHY, ACE-FTS and MAESTRO. Central to our work is a consistent and robust analysis of the comparisons against the ground-based ozonesonde and stratospheric ozone lidar networks. It allowed us to investigate, from the troposphere up to the stratopause, the following main aspects of satellite data quality: long-term stability, overall bias and short-term variability, together with their dependence on geophysical parameters and profile representation. In addition, it permitted us to quantify the overall consistency between the ozone profilers. Generally, we found that between 20 and 40 km the satellite ozone measurement biases are smaller than +/- 5 %, the short-term variabilities are less than 5-12% and the drifts are at most +/- 5% decade(-1) (or even +/- 3% decade(-1) for a few records). The agreement with ground-based data degrades somewhat towards the stratopause and especially towards the tropopause where natural variability and low ozone abundances impede a more precise analysis. In part of the stratosphere a few records deviate from the preceding general conclusions; we identified biases of 10% and more (POAM II and SCIAMACHY), markedly higher single-profile variability (SMR and SCIAMACHY) and significant long-term drifts (SCIAMACHY, OSIRIS, HALOE and possibly GOMOS and SMR as well). Furthermore, we reflected on the repercussions of our findings for the construction, analysis and interpretation of merged data records. Most notably, the discrepancies between several recent ozone profile trend assessments can be mostly explained by instrumental drift. This clearly demonstrates the need for systematic comprehensive multi-instrument comparison analyses.

MIPAS IMK/IAA CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2) measurements: accuracy, precision and long-term stability	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Profiles of CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2) of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) aboard the European satellite Envisat have been retrieved from versions MIPAS/4.61 to MI-PAS/4.62 and MIPAS/5.02 to MIPAS/5.06 level-1b data using the scientific level-2 processor run by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research (IMK) and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA). These profiles have been compared to measurements taken by the balloon-borne cryosampler, Mark IV (MkIV) and MIPAS-Balloon (MIPAS-B), the airborne MIPAS-STRatospheric aircraft (MIPAS-STR), the satellite-borne Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the High Resolution Dynamic Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), as well as the ground-based Halocarbon and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS) network for the reduced spectral resolution period (RR: January 2005-April 2012) of MIPAS. ACE-FTS, MkIV and HATS also provide measurements during the high spectral resolution period (full resolution, FR: July 2002-March 2004) and were used to validate MIPAS CFC-11 and CFC-12 products during that time, as well as profiles from the Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer, ILAS-II. In general, we find that MIPAS shows slightly higher values for CFC-11 at the lower end of the profiles (below similar to 15 km) and in a comparison of HATS ground-based data and MIPAS measurements at 3 km below the tropopause. Differences range from approximately 10 to 50 pptv (similar to 5-20 %) during the RR period. In general, differences are slightly smaller for the FR period. An indication of a slight high bias at the lower end of the profile exists for CFC-12 as well, but this bias is far less pronounced than for CFC-11 and is not as obvious in the relative differences between MIPAS and any of the comparison instruments. Differences at the lower end of the profile (below similar to 15 km) and in the comparison of HATS and MIPAS measurements taken at 3 km below the tropopause mainly stay within 10-50 pptv (corresponding to similar to 2-10% for CFC-12) for the RR and the FR period. Between similar to 15 and 30 km, most comparisons agree within 10-20 pptv (10-20 %), apart from ILAS-II, which shows large differences above similar to 17 km. Overall, relative differences are usually smaller for CFC-12 than for CFC-11. For both species -CFC-11 and CFC-12 - we find that differences at the lower end of the profile tend to be larger at higher latitudes than in tropical and subtropical regions. In addition, MIPAS profiles have a maximum in their mixing ratio around the tropopause, which is most obvious in tropical mean profiles. Comparisons of the standard deviation in a quiescent atmosphere (polar summer) show that only the CFC-12 FR error budget can fully explain the observed variability, while for the other products (CFC-11 FR and RR and CFC-12 RR) only two-thirds to three-quarters can be explained. Investigations regarding the temporal stability show very small negative drifts in MIPAS CFC-11 measurements. These instrument drifts vary between similar to 1 and 3% decade(-1). For CFC-12, the drifts are also negative and close to zero up to similar to 30 km. Above that altitude, larger drifts of up to similar to 50% decade(-1) appear which are negative up to similar to 35 km and positive, but of a similar magnitude, above.

Attribution of net carbon change by disturbance type across forest lands of the conterminous United States	CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT												Background: Locating terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon (C) will be critical to developing strategies that contribute to the climate change mitigation goals of the Paris Agreement. Here we present spatially resolved estimates of net C change across United States (US) forest lands between 2006 and 2010 and attribute them to natural and anthropogenic processes. Results: Forests in the conterminous US sequestered -460 +/- 48 Tg C year(-1), while C losses from disturbance averaged 191 +/- 10 Tg C year(-1). Combining estimates of net C losses and gains results in net carbon change of -269 +/- 49 Tg C year(-1). New forests gained -8 +/- 1 Tg C year(-1), while deforestation resulted in losses of 6 +/- 1 Tg C year(-1). Forest land remaining forest land lost 185 +/- 10 Tg C year(-1) to various disturbances; these losses were compensated by net carbon gains of -452 +/- 48 Tg C year(-1). C loss in the southern US was highest (105 +/- 6 Tg C year(-1)) with the highest fractional contributions from harvest (92%) and wind (5%). C loss in the western US (44 +/- 3 Tg C year(-1)) was due predominantly to harvest (66%), fire (15%), and insect damage (13%). The northern US had the lowest C loss (41 +/- 2 Tg C year(-1)) with the most significant proportional contributions from harvest (86%), insect damage (9%), and conversion (3%). Taken together, these disturbances reduced the estimated potential C sink of US forests by 42%. Conclusion: The framework presented here allows for the integration of ground and space observations to more fully inform US forest C policy and monitoring efforts.

J	Xu, L; Saatchi, SS; Yang, Y; Yu, YF; White, L				Xu, Liang; Saatchi, Sassan S.; Yang, Yan; Yu, Yifan; White, Lee			Performance of non-parametric algorithms for spatial mapping of tropical forest structure	CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT												Background: Mapping tropical forest structure is a critical requirement for accurate estimation of emissions and removals from land use activities. With the availability of a wide range of remote sensing imagery of vegetation characteristics from space, development of finer resolution and more accurate maps has advanced in recent years. However, the mapping accuracy relies heavily on the quality of input layers, the algorithm chosen, and the size and quality of inventory samples for calibration and validation. Results: By using airborne lidar data as the "truth" and focusing on the mean canopy height (MCH) as a key structural parameter, we test two commonly-used non-parametric techniques of maximum entropy (ME) and random forest (RF) for developing maps over a study site in Central Gabon. Results of mapping show that both approaches have improved accuracy with more input layers in mapping canopy height at 100 m (1-ha) pixels. The bias-corrected spatial models further improve estimates for small and large trees across the tails of height distributions with a trade-off in increasing overall mean squared error that can be readily compensated by increasing the sample size. Conclusions: A significant improvement in tropical forest mapping can be achieved by weighting the number of inventory samples against the choice of image layers and the non-parametric algorithms. Without future satellite observations with better sensitivity to forest biomass, the maps based on existing data will remain slightly biased towards the mean of the distribution and under and over estimating the upper and lower tails of the distribution.

J	Demosthenous, E; Borghesi, G; Mastorakos, E; Cant, RS				Demosthenous, Elena; Borghesi, Giulio; Mastorakos, Epaminondas; Cant, Robert Stewart			Direct Numerical Simulations of premixed methane flame initiation by pilot n-heptane spray autoignition	COMBUSTION AND FLAME												Autoignition of n-heptane sprays in a methane/air mixture and the subsequent methane premixed flame ignition, a constant volume configuration relevant to pilot-ignited dual fuel engines, was investigated by DNS. It was found that reducing the pilot fuel quantity, increases its autoignition time. This is attributed to the faster disappearance of the most reactive mixture fraction (predicted from homogeneous reactor calculations) which is quite rich. Consequently, ignition of the n-heptane occurs at leaner mixtures. The premixed methane flame is eventually ignited due to heating gained by the pressure rise caused by the n-heptane oxidation, and heat and mass transfer of intermediates from the n-heptane autoignition kernels. For large amounts of the pilot fuel, the combustion of the n-heptane results in significant adiabatic compression of the methane-air mixture. Hence the slow methane oxidation is accelerated and is further promoted by the presence of species in the oxidizer stream originating from the already ignited regions. For small amounts of the pilot fuel intermediates reach the oxidizer stream faster due to the very lean mixtures surrounding the n-heptane ignition kernels. Therefore, the premixed methane oxidation is initiated at intermediate temperatures. Depending on the amount of n-heptane, different statistical behaviour of the methane oxidation is observed when this is investigated in a reaction progress variable space. In particular for large amounts of n-heptane the methane oxidation follows roughly an autoignition regime, whereas for small amounts of n-heptane methane oxidation is similar to a canonical premixed flame. The data can be used for validation of various turbulent combustion models for dual-fuel combustion. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Modelling calving front dynamics using a level-set method: application to Jakobshavn Isbrae, West Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Calving is a major mechanism of ice discharge of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and a change in calving front position affects the entire stress regime of marine terminating glaciers. The representation of calving front dynamics in a 2-D or 3-D ice sheet model remains non-trivial. Here, we present the theoretical and technical framework for a level-set method, an implicit boundary tracking scheme, which we implement into the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM). This scheme allows us to study the dynamic response of a drainage basin to user-defined calving rates. We apply the method to Jakobshavn Isbr', a major marine terminating outlet glacier of the West Greenland Ice Sheet. The model robustly reproduces the high sensitivity of the glacier to calving, and we find that enhanced calving triggers significant acceleration of the ice stream. Upstream acceleration is sustained through a combination of mechanisms. However, both lateral stress and ice influx stabilize the ice stream. This study provides new insights into the ongoing changes occurring at Jakobshavn Isbr' and emphasizes that the incorporation of moving boundaries and dynamic lateral effects, not captured in flow-line models, is key for realistic model projections of sea level rise on centennial timescales.

L.; Laliberte, Frederic; Kwok, Ron; Derksen, Chris; King, Joshua			Landfast ice thickness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from observations and models	CRYOSPHERE												Observed and modelled landfast ice thickness variability and trends spanning more than 5 decades within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) are summarized. The observed sites (Cambridge Bay, Resolute, Eureka and Alert) represent some of the Arctic's longest records of landfast ice thickness. Observed end-of-winter (maximum) trends of landfast ice thickness (1957-2014) were statistically significant at Cambridge Bay (-4.31 +/- 1.4 cm decade(-1)), Eureka (-4.65 +/- 1.7 cm decade(-1)) and Alert (-4.44aEuro- +/- 1.6aEuro-cm (-1)) but not at Resolute. Over the 50+-year record, the ice thinned by similar to 0.24-0.26 m at Cambridge Bay, Eureka and Alert with essentially negligible change at Resolute. Although statistically significant warming in spring and fall was present at all sites, only low correlations between temperature and maximum ice thickness were present; snow depth was found to be more strongly associated with the negative ice thickness trends. Comparison with multi-model simulations from Coupled Model Intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5), Ocean Reanalysis Intercomparison (ORA-IP) and Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) show that although a subset of current generation models have a 'reasonable' climatological representation of landfast ice thickness and distribution within the CAA, trends are unrealistic and far exceed observations by up to 2 orders of magnitude. ORA-IP models were found to have positive correlations between temperature and ice thickness over the CAA, a feature that is inconsistent with both observations and coupled models from CMIP5.

The observed radiances have information of potential value to weather forecasting agencies and can be used to retrieve lower tropospheric temperature and water vapor globally for weather and climate science investigations. Multiple units can be flown to improve temporal coverage or in formation to provide new data products including 3D atmospheric motion vector winds. CIRAS incorporates key new instrument technologies including a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The detectors are hybridized to a commercial ROIC and commercial camera electronics. The second key technology is an MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed to provide imaging spectroscopy for atmospheric sounding in a CubeSat volume. The MGS has no moving parts and includes an immersion grating to reduce the volume and reduce distortion. The third key technology is an infrared blackbody fabricated with black silicon to have very high emissivity in a flat plate construction. JPL will also develop the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for CIRAS, while the spacecraft will be a commercially available CubeSat. The integrated system will be a complete 6U CubeSat capable of measuring temperature and water vapor profiles with good lower tropospheric sensitivity. The CIRAS is the first step towards the development of an Earth Observation Nanosatellite Infrared (EON-IR) capable of operational readiness to mitigate a potential loss of CrIS on JPSS or complement the current observing system with different orbit crossing times.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0347-9; 978-1-5106-0348-6				2016	9978								UNSP 997806	10.1117/12.2235986							WOS:000389680800003

Storm-triggered landslides in the Peruvian Andes and implications for topography, carbon cycles, and biodiversity	EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS												In this study, we assess the geomorphic role of a rare, large-magnitude landslide-triggering event and consider its effect on mountain forest ecosystems and the erosion of organic carbon in an Andean river catchment. Proximal triggers such as large rain storms are known to cause large numbers of landslides, but the relative effects of such low-frequency, high-magnitude events are not well known in the context of more regular, smaller events. We develop a 25-year duration, annual-resolution landslide inventory by mapping landslide occurrence in the Kosnipata Valley, Peru, from 1988 to 2012 using Landsat, QuickBird, and WorldView satellite images. Catchment-wide landslide rates were high, averaging 0.076% yr(-1) by area. As a result, landslides on average completely turn over hillslopes every similar to 1320 years, although our data suggest that landslide occurrence varies spatially and temporally, such that turnover times are likely to be non-uniform. In total, landslides stripped 26 +/- 4 tC km(-2) yr(-1) of organic carbon from soil (80 %) and vegetation (20 %) during the study period. A single rain storm in March 2010 accounted for 27% of all landslide area observed during the 25-year study and accounted for 26% of the landslide-associated organic carbon flux. An approximately linear magnitude-frequency relationship for annual landslide areas suggests that large storms contribute an equivalent landslide failure area to the sum of lower-frequency landslide events occurring over the same period. However, the spatial distribution of landslides associated with the 2010 storm is distinct. On the basis of precipitation statistics and landscape morphology, we hypothesise that focusing of storm-triggered landslide erosion at lower elevations in the Kosnipata catchment may be characteristic of longer-term patterns. These patterns may have implications for the source and composition of sediments and organic material supplied to river systems of the Amazon Basin, and, through focusing of regular ecological disturbance, for the species composition of forested ecosystems in the region.

Using optimum interpolation (OI), in situ and satellite observations are combined on a daily and 0.25 degrees spatial grid to form an SST analysis, i.e., a spatially complete field. A large-scale bias adjustment of the input infrared SSTs is made using buoy and ship observations as a reference. This is particularly important for the time periods when volcanic aerosols from the El Chichon and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions are widespread globally. The main source of SSTs is the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), available from late 1981 to the present, which is also the temporal span of this CDR. The input and processing choices made to ensure a consistent data set that meets the CDR requirements are summarized. A brief history and an explanation of the forward production schedule for the preliminary and science-quality final product are also provided. The data set is produced and archived at the newly formed National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) at doi:10.7289/V5SQ8XB5.

Although evidence suggests there is a strong linkage between lignin concentrations and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients in coastal waters, the characteristics of this linkage and the existence of a relationship that is applicable across coastal oceans remain unclear. Here, 421 paired measurements of dissolved lignin concentrations (sum of nine lignin phenols) and CDOM absorption coefficients [a(g)(lambda)] were used to examine their relationship along the river-ocean continuum (0-37 salinity) and across contrasting coastal oceans (sub-tropical, temperate, high-latitude). Overall, lignin concentrations spanned four orders of magnitude and revealed a strong, non-linear relationship with a(g)(lambda). The characteristics of the relationship (shape, wavelength dependency, lignin-composition dependency) and evidence from degradation indicators were all consistent with lignin being an important driver of CDOM variability in coastal oceans, and suggested physical mixing and long-term photodegradation were important in shaping the relationship. These observations were used to develop two simple empirical models for estimating lignin concentrations from a(g)(lambda) with a +/- 20% error relative to measured values. The models are expected to be applicable in most coastal oceans influenced by terrigenous inputs.				; Shen, Yuan/B-8222-2009	Fichot, Cedric/0000-0002-1099-5764; Shen, Yuan/0000-0001-6618-4226; Kaiser, Karl/0000-0002-4951-4665													2296-7745					2016	3								7	10.3389/fmars.2016.00007							WOS:000457358000007						
J	Fu, LL				Fu, Lee-Lueng			On the Decadal Trend of Global Mean Sea Level and Its Implication on Ocean Heat Content Change	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The variability of the trend of the global mean sea level (GMSL) on decadal scales is of great importance to understanding the long-term evolution of the GMSL. Trend determination is affected by the temporally correlated processes in the record, which have often not been properly accounted for in previous studies. The problem is treated here as one of optimal estimation weighted by the auto-covariance of the time series, which takes into account the various underlying time scales affecting trend estimation. On decadal scales, the estimated standard error of the trend determined from the GMSL record from radar altimetry is about 0.3 mm/yr, which is comparable to the widely quoted 0.4 mm/yr systematic error and cannot be neglected in the error budget. The time scale of the systematic errors is assumed to be much longer than decadal scale, over which the formal error of the trend estimate becomes dominant. The approach is also applied to determining steric sea level from altimeter-measured sea level and ocean mass estimated from the GRACE observations. The estimated trend error of steric sea level, 0.12 mm/yr, suggests that the change of the global ocean heat content over decadal scales can be estimated from space observations to an accuracy on the order of 0.1 W/m(2). The difference between the steric sea level, estimated from Argo plus the estimated contribution from the deep ocean, and that from altimeter and GRACE, 0.18 +/- 0.25 mm/yr, provides an estimate of the combined systematic errors of altimetry minus GRACE observations over the 10 year time span of overlapping Argo and GRACE data.																		2296-7745					2016	3								37	10.3389/fmars.2016.00037							WOS:000457358000036

Three rivers discharge into the bay, and relatively high values of syringyl:vanillyl phenols (0.73 +/- 0.07) and cinnamyl:vanillyl phenols (0.33 +/- 0.10) indicated large contributions of non-woody angiosperm tissues to lignin and tDOM. The physical mixing of river and seawater played an important role in controlling the concentrations and distributions of lignin phenols and chromophoric DOM (CDOM) optical properties in the bay. Lignin phenol concentrations and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm, a(350), were strongly correlated in river and bay waters. Measurements of lignin phenols and CDOM in bay waters indicated a variety of photochemical and biological transformations of tDOM, including oxidation reactions, photobleaching and a decrease in molecular weight. Photodegradation and biodegradation of lignin and CDOM were investigated in decomposition experiments with river water and native microbial assemblages exposed to natural sunlight or kept in the dark. There was a rapid and substantial removal of lignin phenols and CDOM during the first few days in the light treatment, indicating transformations of tDOM and CDOM can occur soon after discharge of buoyant river water into the bay. The removal of lignin phenols was slightly greater in the dark (34%) than in the light (30%) during the remaining 59 days of the incubation. Comparison of the light and dark treatments indicated biodegradation was responsible for 67% of total lignin phenols removal during the 62-day incubation exposed to natural sunlight, indicating biodegradation is a dominant removal process in Otsuchi Bay.

Torsion of a cylinder of partially molten rock with a spherical inclusion: Theory and simulation	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The processes that are involved in migration and extraction of melt from the mantle are not yet fully understood. Gaining a better understanding of material properties of partially molten rock could help shed light on the behavior of melt on larger scales in the mantle. In this study, we simulate three-dimensional torsional deformation of a partially molten rock that contains a rigid, spherical inclusion. We compare the computed porosity patterns to those found in recent laboratory experiments. The laboratory experiments show emergence of melt-rich bands throughout the rock sample, and pressure shadows around the inclusion. The numerical model displays similar melt-rich bands only for a small bulk-to-shear-viscosity ratio (five or less). The results are consistent with earlier two-dimensional numerical simulations; however, we show that it is easier to form melt-rich bands in three dimensions compared to two. The addition of strain-rate dependence of the viscosity causes a distinct change in the shape of pressure shadows around the inclusion. This change in shape presents an opportunity for experimentalists to identify the strain-rate dependence and therefore the dominant deformation mechanism in torsion experiments with inclusions.				; Katz, Richard/D-3364-2009; Wells, Garth/C-6375-2011	Rhebergen, Sander/0000-0001-6036-0356; Katz, Richard/0000-0001-8746-5430; Wells, Garth/0000-0001-5291-7951												1525-2027					JAN	2016	17	1					143	161		10.1002/2015GC006061							WOS:000370620600010

Trans-Pacific transport and evolution of aerosols: evaluation of quasi-global WRF-Chem simulation with multiple observations	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												A fully coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry) has been configured to conduct quasi-global simulation for 5 years (2010-2014) and evaluated with multiple observation data sets for the first time. The evaluation focuses on the simulation over the trans-Pacific transport region using various reanalysis and observational data sets for meteorological fields and aerosol properties. The simulation generally captures the overall spatial and seasonal variability of satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and absorbing AOD (AAOD) over the Pacific that is determined by the outflow of pollutants and dust and the emissions of marine aerosols. The assessment of simulated extinction Angstrom exponent (EAE) indicates that the model generally reproduces the variability of aerosol size distributions as seen by satellites. In addition, the vertical profile of aerosol extinction and its seasonality over the Pacific are also well simulated. The difference between the simulation and satellite retrievals can be mainly attributed to model biases in estimating marine aerosol emissions as well as the satellite sampling and retrieval uncertainties. Compared with the surface measurements over the western USA, the model reasonably simulates the observed magnitude and seasonality of dust, sulfate, and nitrate surface concentrations, but significantly underestimates the peak surface concentrations of carbonaceous aerosol likely due to model biases in the spatial and temporal variability of biomass burning emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production. A sensitivity simulation shows that the trans-Pacific transported dust, sulfate, and nitrate can make significant contribution to surface concentrations over the rural areas of the western USA, while the peaks of carbonaceous aerosol surface concentrations are dominated by the North American emissions. Both the retrievals and simulation show small interannual variability of aerosol characteristics for 2010-2014 averaged over three Pacific sub-regions. The evaluation in this study demonstrates that the WRF-Chem quasi-global simulation can be used for investigating trans-Pacific transport of aerosols and providing reasonable inflow chemical boundaries for the western USA, allowing one to further understand the impact of transported pollutants on the regional air quality and climate with high-resolution nested regional modeling.

Such models have a broad range of potential applications in studying the dynamics of marine ice sheets and tidewater glaciers, from process studies to future projections of ice mass loss and sea level rise. The Marine Ice Sheet-Ocean Model Intercomparison Project ( MISOMIP) is a community effort aimed at designing and coordinating a series of model intercomparison projects ( MIPs) for model evaluation in idealized setups, model verification based on observations, and future projections for key regions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS). Here we describe computational experiments constituting three interrelated MIPs for marine ice sheet models and regional ocean circulation models incorporating ice shelf cavities. These consist of ice sheet experiments under the Marine Ice Sheet MIP third phase ( MISMIP+), ocean experiments under the Ice Shelf-Ocean MIP second phase ( ISOMIP+) and coupled ice sheet-ocean experiments under the MISOMIP first phase ( MISOMIP1). All three MIPs use a shared domain with idealized bedrock topography and forcing, allowing the coupled simulations ( MISOMIP1) to be compared directly to the individual component simulations ( MISMIP+ and ISOMIP+). The experiments, which have qualitative similarities to Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf and the adjacent region of the Amundsen Sea, are designed to explore the effects of changes in ocean conditions, specifically the temperature at depth, on basal melting and ice dynamics. In future work, differences between model results will form the basis for the evaluation of the participating models.

Efficiently feeding single-mode fiber photonic spectrographs with an extreme adaptive optics system: on-sky characterization and preliminary spectroscopy	GROUND-BASED AND AIRBORNE INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Ground-Based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy VI	JUN 26-30, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				High-order wavefront correction is not only beneficial for high-contrast imaging, but also spectroscopy. The size of a spectrograph can be decoupled from the size of the telescope aperture by moving to the diffraction limit which has strong implications for ELT based instrument design. Here we present the construction and characterization of an extremely efficient single-mode fiber feed behind an extreme adaptive optics system (SCExAO). We show that this feed can indeed be utilized to great success by photonic-based spectrographs. We present metrics to quantify the system performance and some preliminary spectra delivered by the compact spectrograph.

VISIR is the midinfrared imager and spectrograph at ESO's VLT. The project team is comprised of ESO staff and members of the original VISIR consortium: CEA Saclay and ASTRON. The project plan was based on input from the ESO user community with the goal of enhancing the scientific performance and efficiency of VISIR by a combination of measures: installation of improved hardware, optimization of instrument operations and software support. The cornerstone of the upgrade is the 1k by 1k Si: As AQUARIUS detector array manufactured by Raytheon. In addition, a new prism spectroscopic mode covers the whole N-band in a single observation. Finally, new scientific capabilities for high resolution and high-contrast imaging are offered by sub-aperture mask and coronagraphic modes. In order to make optimal use of favourable atmospheric conditions, a water vapour monitor has been deployed on Paranal, allowing for real-time decisions and the introduction of a user-defined constraint on water vapour. During the commissioning in 2012, it was found that the on-sky sensitivity of the AQUARIUS detector was significantly below expectations. Extensive testing of the detector arrays in the laboratory and on-sky enabled us to diagnose the cause for the shortcoming of the detector as excess low frequency noise. It is inherent to the design chosen for this detector and cannot be remedied by changing the detector set-up. Since this is a form of correlated noise, its impact can be limited by modulating the scene recorded by the detector. After careful analysis, we have implemented fast (up to 4 Hz) chopping with field stabilization using the secondary mirror of the VLT. During commissioning, the upgraded VISIR has been confirmed to be more sensitive than the old instrument, and in particular for low-resolution spectroscopy in the N-band, a gain of a factor 6 is realized in observing efficiency. After overcoming several additional technical problems, VISIR is back in Science Operations since April 2015. In addition an upgrade of the IT infrastructure related to VISIR has been conducted in order to support burst-mode operations. Science Verification of the new modes was performed in Feb 2016. The upgraded VISIR is a powerful instrument providing close to background limited performance for diffraction-limited observations at an 8-m telescope. It offers synergies with facilities such as ALMA, JWST, VLTI and SOFIA, while a wealth of targets is available from survey works like WISE. In addition, it will bring confirmation of the technical readiness and scientific value of several aspects for future mid-IR instrumentation at Extremely Large Telescopes. We also present several lessons learned during the project.

Exploiting the Subaru prime focus, 2394 reconfigurable fibers will be distributed over the 1.3 deg field of view. The spectrograph has been designed with 3 arms of blue, red, and near-infrared cameras to simultaneously observe spectra from 380nm to 1260nm in one exposure at a resolution of similar to 1.6-2.7 angstrom. An international collaboration is developing this instrument under the initiative of Kavli IPMU. The project is now going into the construction phase aiming at undertaking system integration in 2017-2018 and subsequently carrying out engineering operations in 2018-2019. This article gives an overview of the instrument, current project status and future paths forward.

PFS will cover 1.3 degree diameter field with 2394 fibers to complement the imaging capability of Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC). The prime focus unit of PFS called Prime Focus Instrument (PFI) provides the interface with the top structure of Subaru telescope and also accommodates the optical bench in which Cobra fiber positioners are located. In addition, the acquisition and guiding cameras (AGCs), the optical fiber positioner system, the cable wrapper, the fiducial fibers, illuminator, and viewer, the field element, and the telemetry system are located inside the PFI. The mechanical structure of the PFI was designed with special care such that its deflections sufficiently match those of the HSC's Wide Field Corrector (WFC) so the fibers will stay on targets over the course of the observations within the required accuracy. In this report, the latest status of PFI development will be given including the performance of PFI components, the setup and performance of the integration and testing equipment.

APS is based on the successful Phasing Camera System (PCS) used to align the Keck Telescopes. Since the successful APS conceptual design in 2007, work has concentrated on risk mitigation, use case generation, and alignment algorithm development and improvement. Much of the risk mitigation effort has centered around development and testing of prototype APS software which will replace the current PCS software used at Keck. We present an updated APS design, example use cases and discuss, in detail, the risk mitigation efforts.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0191-8; 978-1-5106-0192-5				2016	9906		1						UNSP 99066A	10.1117/12.2231913							WOS:000387731100192

The WACMOS-ET project - Part 1: Tower-scale evaluation of four remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration algorithms	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The WAter Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy - EvapoTranspiration (WACMOS-ET) project has compiled a forcing data set covering the period 2005-2007 that aims to maximize the exploitation of European Earth Observations data sets for evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. The data set was used to run four established ET algorithms: the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), the Penman-Monteith algorithm from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). In addition, in situ meteorological data from 24 FLUXNET towers were used to force the models, with results from both forcing sets compared to tower-based flux observations. Model performance was assessed on several timescales using both sub-daily and daily forcings. The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for both satellite-and tower-based forcing as well as for the considered temporal resolutions. Simulations using the PM-MOD were mostly underestimated, while the SEBS performance was characterized by a systematic overestimation. In general, all four algorithms produce the best results in wet and moderately wet climate regimes. In dry regimes, the correlation and the absolute agreement with the reference tower ET observations were consistently lower. While ET derived with in situ forcing data agrees best with the tower measurements (R-2 = 0.67), the agreement of the satellite-based ET estimates is only marginally lower (R-2 = 0.58). Results also show similar model performance at daily and sub-daily (3-hourly) resolutions. Overall, our validation experiments against in situ measurements indicate that there is no single best-performing algorithm across all biome and forcing types. An extension of the evaluation to a larger selection of 85 towers (model inputs resampled to a common grid to facilitate global estimates) confirmed the original findings.

DPOD2008: A DORIS-Oriented Terrestrial Reference Frame for Precise Orbit Determination	IAG 150 YEARS	International Association of Geodesy Symposia				Scientific Assembly of the International-Association-of-Geodesy (IAG)	SEP 01-06, 2013	Potsdam, GERMANY	Int Assoc Geodesy				While accuracy of tracking station coordinates is of key importance for Precise Orbit Determination (POD) for altimeter satellites, reliability and operationality are also of great concern. In particular, while recent ITRF realizations should be the most accurate at the time of their computation, they cannot be directly used by the POD groups for operational consideration for several reasons such as new stations appearing in the network or new discontinuities affecting station coordinates. For POD purposes, we computed a new DORIS terrestrial frame called DPOD2008 derived from ITRF2008 (as previously done by DPOD2005 with regards to ITRF2005). In a first step, we will present the method used to validate the past ITRF2008 using more recent DORIS data and to derive new station positions and velocities, when needed. In particular, discontinuities in DORIS station positions and/or velocities are discussed. To derive new DORIS station coordinates, we used recent DORIS weekly time series of coordinates, recent GPS relevant time series at co-located sites and also dedicated GPS campaigns performed by IGN when installing new DORIS beacons. DPOD2008 also contains additional metadata that are useful when processing DORIS data, for example, periods during which DORIS data should not be used or at least for which data should be downweighted. In several cases, a physical explanation can be found for such temporary antenna instability. We then demonstrate improvements seen when using different reference frames, such as the original ITRF2008 solution, for precise orbit determination of altimeter satellites TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-2 over selected periods spanning 1993-2013.

The New IAU/IAG Joint Working Group on Theory of Earth Rotation	IAG 150 YEARS	International Association of Geodesy Symposia				Scientific Assembly of the International-Association-of-Geodesy (IAG)	SEP 01-06, 2013	Potsdam, GERMANY	Int Assoc Geodesy				The Earth's rotation is considered to be one of the three pillars of modern Geodesy. In 2012 the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) and the International Astronomical Union (IAU) initiated a process to establish a Joint Working Group (JWG) on the Theory of Earth Rotation with the purpose of promoting the development of improved theories of Earth rotation which reach the accuracy required to meet the needs of the near future as recommended by, e.g., GGOS, the Global Geodetic Observing System of the IAG. The JWG was approved by both organizations in April 2013 with the chairs being the two authors of this paper. Its structure comprises three SubWorking Groups (SWGs) addressing Precession/Nutation, Polar Motion and UT1, and Numerical Solutions and Validation, respectively. The SWGs should work in parallel for the sake of efficiency, but should keep consistency as an overall goal. This paper offers a view of the objectives and scope of the JWG and reports about its initial activities and plans.

Saturn kilometric radiation intensities during the Saturn auroral campaign of 2013	ICARUS												The Saturn auroral campaign carried out in the spring of 2013 used multiple Earth-based observations, remote-sensing observations from Cassini, and in situ-observations from Cassini to further our understanding of auroras at Saturn. Most of the remote sensing and Earth-based measurements are, by nature, not continuous. And, even the in situ measurements, while continuously obtained, are not always obtained in regions relevant to the study of the aurora. Saturn kilometric radiation, however, is remotely monitored nearly continuously by the Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument on Cassini. This radio emission, produced by the cyclotron maser instability, is tightly tied to auroral processes at Saturn as are auroral radio emissions at other planets, most notably Jupiter and Earth. This paper provides the time history of the intensity of the radio emissions through the auroral campaign as a means of understanding the temporal relationships between the sometimes widely spaced observations of the auroral activity. While beaming characteristics of the radio emissions are known to prevent single spacecraft observations of this emission from being a perfect auroral activity indicator, we demonstrate a good correlation between the radio emission intensity and the level of UV auroral activity, when both measurements are available.

Ground-based observations of Saturn's auroral ionosphere over three days: Trends in HI temperature, density and emission with Saturn local time and planetary period oscillation	ICARUS												On 19-21 April 2013, the ground-based 10-m W.M. Keck II telescope was used to simultaneously measure HI emissions from four regions of Saturn's auroral ionosphere: (1) the northern noon region of the main auroral oval; (2) the northern midnight main oval; (3) the northern polar cap and (4) the southern noon main oval. The H-3(+) emission from these regions was captured in the form of high resolution spectral images as the planet rotated. The results herein contain twenty-three H-3(+) temperatures, column densities and total emissions located in the aforementioned regions - ninety-two data points in total, spread over timescales of both hours and days. Thermospheric temperatures in the spring-time northern main oval are found to be cooler than their autumn-time southern counterparts by tens of K, consistent with the hypothesis that the total thermospheric heating rate is inversely proportional to magnetic field strength. The main oval H-3(+) density and emission is lower at northern midnight than it is at noon, in agreement with a nearby peak in the electron influx in the post-dawn sector and a minimum flux at midnight. Finally, when arranging the northern main oval H-3(+) parameters as a function of the oscillation period seen in Saturn's magnetic field the planetary period oscillation (PPO) phase - we see a large peak in H-3(+) density and emission at similar to 115 degrees northern phase, with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of similar to 44 degrees. This seems to indicate that the influx of electrons associated with the PPO phase at 90 is responsible at least in part for the behavior of all H(3)(+)parameters. A combination of the H-3(+) production and loss timescales and the 10 uncertainty in the location of a given PPO phase are likely, at least in part, to be responsible for the observed peaks in H-3(+) density and emission occurring at a later time than the peak precipitation expected at 90 PPO phase.

Simultaneous multi-scale and multi-instrument observations of Saturn's aurorae during the 2013 observing campaign	ICARUS												On 21 April 2013, during a co-ordinated Saturn auroral observing campaign, the northern and southern poles of the planet were observed from the Earth using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), Keck, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) simultaneously with the Cassini infrared, visible, and ultraviolet remote sensing instruments. We present simultaneous multi-scale and multi-wavelength analysis of the morphology of auroral emissions at Saturn. The visible main auroral emission vary between similar to 2 and 10 kR on timescales of minutes and across spatial scales of down to similar to 14 km on the planet. The H-2 Far Ultraviolet (FUV) brightness varies by a factor of similar to 10, from similar to 4-40 kR, over timescales of 1 min and spatial scales of 720 km. H-3(+) infrared emissions vary less than the H-2 emissions, from similar to 5-10 mu W m(-2) sr(-1), over similar spatial scales (similar to 300 km) and timescales of a few seconds to a few hours. The fine-scale temporal and spatial features seen in the main oval show that complex structures are present even during quiet solar wind conditions. Diffuse ultraviolet emissions southward of the southern midnight main oval that are not seen in the infrared, implying a steep temperature gradient of similar to 50 K over 2-4 degrees latitude equatorward of the main oval. Dynamics on scales of similar to 100 km at the poles are revealed by lower spatial resolution observations, the morphologies of which are partly consistent with overlapping local-time fixed and co-rotating current systems. We also present the first direct comparison of simultaneous infrared, visible, and ultraviolet auroral emissions at Saturn. Finally, the main auroral emissions are found to be approximately co-located in the midnight sector, forming an arc with a width of similar to 0.5-1 degrees, at 72-74 degrees southern latitude, moving slightly equatorward with increasing local-time.

Saturn's auroral morphology and field-aligned currents during a solar wind compression	ICARUS												On 21-22 April 2013, during a coordinated auroral observing campaign, instruments onboard Cassini and the Hubble Space Telescope observed Saturn's aurora while Cassini traversed Saturn's high latitude auroral field lines. Signatures of upward and downward field-aligned currents were detected in the nightside magnetosphere in the magnetic field and plasma measurements. The location of the upward current corresponded to the bright ultraviolet auroral arc seen in the auroral images, and the downward current region was located poleward of the upward current in an aurorally dark region. Within the polar cap magnetic field and plasma fluctuations were identified with periods of similar to 20 and similar to 60 min. The northern and southern auroral ovals were observed to rock in latitude in phase with the respective northern and southern planetary period oscillations. A solar wind compression impacted Saturn's magnetosphere at the start of 22 April 2013, identified by an intensification and extension to lower frequencies of the Saturn kilometric radiation, with the following sequence of effects: (1) intensification of the auroral field-aligned currents; (2) appearance of a localised, intense bulge in the dawnside (04-06 LT) aurora while the midnight sector aurora remained fainter and narrow; and (3) latitudinal broadening and poleward contraction of the nightside aurora, where the poleward motion in this sector is opposite to that expected from a model of the auroral oval's usual oscillation. These observations are interpreted as the response to tail reconnection events, initially involving Vasyliunas-type reconnection of closed mass-loaded magnetotail field lines, and then proceeding onto open lobe field lines, causing the contraction of the polar cap region on the night side.

Survey of Inter-Satellite Communication for Small Satellite Systems: Physical Layer to Network Layer View	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS												Small satellite systems enable a whole new class of missions for navigation, communications, remote sensing, and scientific research for both civilian and military purposes. As individual spacecraft are limited by the size, mass, and power constraints, mass-produced small satellites in large constellations or clusters could be useful in many science missions such as gravity mapping, tracking of forest fires, finding water resources, etc. The proliferation of small satellites will enable a better understanding of the near-Earth environment and provide an efficient and economical means to access the space through the use of multi-satellite solution. Constellation of satellites provide improved spatial and temporal resolution of the target. Small satellite constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing a single asset with several very capable spacecraft, which opens the door to new applications. Future space missions are envisioned to become more complex and operate farther from Earth, and will need to support autonomous operations with minimal human intervention. With increasing levels of autonomy, there will be a need for remote communication networks to enable communication between spacecraft. These space-based networks will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage intermediate nodes, and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives. Hence, inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in formation. In this survey, we present the various research being conducted in the small satellite community for implementing inter-satellite communications based on the open system interconnection (OSI) model. This survey also reviews the various design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI model, i.e., physical, data link, and network layer. Based on the survey, we also present a comprehensive list of design parameters useful for achieving inter-satellite communications for multiple small satellite missions. Specific topics include proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small satellite systems, enabling operations using a network of small satellites, and some examples of small satellite missions involving formation flying aspects.																	1553-877X						2016	18	4					2442	2473		10.1109/COMST.2016.2564990							WOS:000389202500006

Capturing Complete Spatial Context in Satellite Observations of Greenhouse Gases	IMAGING SPECTROMETRY XXI	Proceedings of SPIE				SPIE's 21st Imaging Spectrometry Conference	AUG 29-30, 2016	San Diego, CA	SPIE				Scientific consensus from a 2015 pre-Decadal Survey workshop highlighted the essential need for a wide-swath (mapping) low earth orbit (LEO) instrument delivering carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements with global coverage. OCO-2 pioneered space-based CO2 remote sensing, but lacks the CH4, CO and mapping capabilities required for an improved understanding of the global carbon cycle. The Carbon Balance Observatory (CARBO) advances key technologies to enable high-performance, cost-effective solutions for a space-based carbon-climate observing system. CARBO is a compact, modular, 15-30 degrees field of view spectrometer that delivers high-precision CO2, CH4, CO and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data with weekly global coverage from LEO. CARBO employs innovative immersion grating technologies to achieve diffraction-limited performance with OCO-like spatial (2x2 km(2)) and spectral (lambda/Delta lambda approximate to 20,000) resolution in a package that is >50% smaller, lighter and more cost-effective. CARBO delivers a 25- to 50-fold increase in spatial coverage compared to OCO-2 with no loss of detection sensitivity. Individual CARBO modules weigh < 20 kg, opening diverse new space-based platform opportunities.

Mid and thermal infrared remote sensing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory	INFRARED TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS XLII	Proceedings of SPIE				42 Conference on Infrared Technology and Applications XLII	APR 18-21, 2016	Baltimore, MA	SPIE				The mid and thermal infrared (MTIR) for the Earth surface is defined between 3 and 14 mu m. In the outer solar system, objects are colder and their Planck response shifts towards longer wavelengths. Hence for these objects (e.g. icy moons, polar caps, comets, Europa), the thermal IR definition usually stretches out to 50 mu m and beyond. Spectroscopy has been a key part of this scientific exploration because of its ability to remotely determine elemental and mineralogical composition. Many key gas species such as methane, ammonia, sulfur, etc. also have vibrational bands which show up in the thermal infrared spectrum above the background response. Over the past few decades, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been building up a portfolio of technology to capture the MTIR for various scientific applications. Three recent sensors are briefly reviewed: The airborne Hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES), the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Mars Climate Sounder (MCS)/DIVINER. Each of these sensors utilize a different technology to provide a remote sensing product based on MTIR science. For example, HyTES is a push-brooming hyperspectral imager which utilizes a large format quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP). The goal is to transition this to a new complementary barrier infrared photodetector (CBIRD) with a similar long wave cut-off and increased sensitivity. ECOSTRESS is a push-whisk Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) based high speed, multi-band, imager which will eventually observe and characterize plant/vegetation functionality and stress index from the International Space Station (ISS) across the contiguous United States (CONUS). MCS/DIVINER utilizes thermopile technology to capture the thermal emission from the polar caps and shadow regions of the moon. Each sensor utilizes specific JPL technology to capture unique science.

Analysis of high altitude clouds in the martian atmosphere based on Mars Climate Sounder observations	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SUN, EARTH, AND LIFE (ISSEL), 2016	Journal of Physics Conference Series				International Symposium on Sun Earth and Life (ISSEL)	JUN 03-04, 2016	Inst Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, INDONESIA	Indonesian Academy of Sciences, National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, Tamaris Hydro, BFI Finance	Inst Teknologi Bandung			High altitude clouds have been observed in the Martian atmosphere. However, their properties still remain to be characterized. Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is an instrument that measures radiances in the thermal infrared, both in limb and nadir views. It allows us to retrieve vertical pro fi les of radiance, temperature and aerosols. Using the MCS data and radiative transfer model coupled with an automated inversion routine, we can investigate the chemical composition of the high altitude clouds. We will present the fi rst results on the properties of the clouds. CO2 ice is the best candidate to be the main component of some high altitude clouds due to the most similar spectral variation compared to water ice or dust, in agreement with previous studies. Using cloud composition of contaminated CO2 ice (dust core surrounded by CO2 ice) might improve the fi tting result, but further study is needed.

ChemCam activities and discoveries during the nominal mission of the Mars Science Laboratory in Gale crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY												At Gale crater, Mars, ChemCam acquired its first laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) target on Sol 13 of the landed portion of the mission (a Sol is a Mars day). Up to Sol 800, more than 188 000 LIBS spectra were acquired on more than 5800 points distributed over about 650 individual targets. We present a comprehensive review of ChemCam scientific accomplishments during that period, together with a focus on the lessons learned from the first use of LIBS in space. For data processing, we describe new tools that had to be developed to account for the uniqueness of Mars data. With regard to chemistry, we present a summary of the composition range measured on Mars for major-element oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O) based on various multivariate models, with associated precisions. ChemCam also observed H, and the non-metallic elements C, O, P, and S, which are usually difficult to quantify with LIBS. F and Cl are observed through their molecular lines. We discuss the most relevant LIBS lines for detection of minor and trace elements (Li, Rb, Sr, Ba, Cr, Mn, Ni, and Zn). These results were obtained thanks to comprehensive ground reference datasets, which are set to mimic the expected mineralogy and chemistry on Mars. With regard to the first use of LIBS in space, we analyze and quantify, often for the first time, each of the advantages of using stand-off LIBS in space: no sample preparation, analysis within its petrological context, dust removal, sub-millimeter scale investigation, multi-point analysis, the ability to carry out statistical surveys and whole-rock analyses, and rapid data acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of ChemCam performance to survey the geochemistry of Mars, and its valuable support of decisions about selecting where and whether to make observations with more time and resource-intensive tools in the rover's instrument suite. In the end, we present a bird's-eye view of the many scientific results: discovery of felsic Noachian crust, first observation of hydrated soil, discovery of manganese-rich coatings and fracture fills indicating strong oxidation potential in Mars' early atmosphere, characterization of soils by grain size, and wide scale mapping of sedimentary strata, conglomerates, and diagenetic materials.

Jeremy			Methods and limitations of focal plane sensing, estimation, and control in high-contrast imaging	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS												Coronagraphy is a very promising method for directly imaging exoplanets, but the performance of a coronagraph is highly sensitive to quasi-static aberrations within the telescope. The resultant speckles are suppressed in the final focal plane using a wavefront control system that estimates the field at the final focal plane to avoid any noncommon path error. This requires a set of probe images that modulate the field so that it may be estimated. With an estimate of the focal plane electric field, a control law is defined to suppress the speckle field so that the planet can be imaged. Characterizing the planet requires that the speckle field be suppressed simultaneously over the bandpass of interest. The choice of control law, bandpass, estimator, and probing methodology has implications in the control solutions and contrast performance. Here, we compare wavefront probing, estimation, and control algorithms, and describe their practical implementation.

JPL will provide a high-contrast imaging coronagraph instrument-one of two major astronomical instruments. In order to achieve the low noise performance required to detect planets under extremely low flux conditions, the electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) has been baselined for both of the coronagraph's sensors-the imaging camera and integral field spectrograph. JPL has established an EMCCD test laboratory in order to advance EMCCD maturity to technology readiness level-6. This plan incorporates full sensor characterization, including read noise, dark current, and clock-induced charge. In addition, by considering the unique challenges of the WFIRST space environment, degradation to the sensor's charge transfer efficiency will be assessed, as a result of damage from high-energy particles such as protons, electrons, and cosmic rays. Science-grade CCD201-20 EMCCDs have been irradiated to a proton fluence that reflects the projected WFIRST orbit. Performance degradation due to radiation displacement damage is reported, which is the first such study for a CCD201-20 that replicates the WFIRST conditions. In addition, techniques intended to identify and mitigate radiation-induced electron trapping, such as trap pumping, custom clocking, and thermal cycling, are discussed.

Jeremy			Coronagraph instrument for WFIRST-AFTA	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS												The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a NASA observatory concept, now in phase A study, which is designed to perform wide-field imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys for dark energy research and other astrophysical studies. It will also perform microlensing surveys to look for distant exoplanets in our galaxy, and direct imaging studies of some of the very nearest exoplanets. The current astrophysics focused telescope assets (AFTA) design of the mission makes use of an existing 2.4-m telescope, which yields enhanced sensitivity and imaging performance in all these science programs. AFTA also enables the addition of a coronagraph instrument (CGI) for direct imaging and spectroscopy of nearby giant exoplanets (including some that were discovered by radial velocity and other methods), and also for observing debris disks around the candidate host stars. This paper outlines the context for the other papers in this special volume on the WFIRST-AFTA CGI, covering the science, design, engineering, and technology development of the observatory and its CGI.

J	Kwok, R; Morison, J				Kwok, Ron; Morison, James			Sea surface height and dynamic topography of the ice-covered oceans from CryoSat-2: 2011-2014	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We examine 4 years (2011-2014) of sea surface heights (SSH) from CryoSat-2 (CS-2) over the ice-covered Arctic and Southern Oceans. Results are from a procedure that identifies and determines the heights of sea surface returns. Along 25 km segments of satellite ground tracks, variability in the retrieved SSHs is between similar to 2 and 3 cm (standard deviation) in the Arctic and is slightly higher (similar to 3 cm) in the summer and the Southern Ocean. Average sea surface tilts (along these 25 km segments) are 0.013.8 cm/10 km in the Arctic, and slightly lower (0.012.0 cm/10 km) in the Southern Ocean. Intra-seasonal variability of CS-2 dynamic ocean topography (DOT) in the ice-covered Arctic is nearly twice as high as that of the Southern Ocean. In the Arctic, we find a correlation of 0.92 between 3 years of DOT and dynamic heights (DH) from hydrographic stations. Further, correlation of 4 years of area-averaged CS-2 DOT near the North Pole with time-variable ocean-bottom pressure from a pressure gauge and from GRACE, yields coefficients of 0.83 and 0.77, with corresponding differences of <3 cm (RMS). These comparisons contrast the length scale of baroclinic and barotropic features and reveal the smaller amplitude barotropic signals in the Arctic Ocean. Broadly, the mean DOT from CS-2 for both poles compares well with those from the ICESat campaigns and the DOT2008A and DTU13MDT fields. Short length scale topographic variations, due to oceanographic signals and geoid residuals, are especially prominent in the Arctic Basin but less so in the Southern Ocean.

Mineralogy, provenance, and diagenesis of a potassic basaltic sandstone on Mars: CheMin X-ray diffraction of the Windjana sample (Kimberley area, Gale Crater)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												The Windjana drill sample, a sandstone of the Dillinger member (Kimberley formation, Gale Crater, Mars), was analyzed by CheMin X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the MSL Curiosity rover. From Rietveld refinements of its XRD pattern, Windjana contains the following: sanidine (21% weight, similar to Or(95)); augite (20%); magnetite (12%); pigeonite; olivine; plagioclase; amorphous and smectitic material (similar to 25%); and percent levels of others including ilmenite, fluorapatite, and bassanite. From mass balance on the Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) chemical analysis, the amorphous material is Fe rich with nearly no other cationslike ferrihydrite. The Windjana sample shows little alteration and was likely cemented by its magnetite and ferrihydrite. From ChemCam Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer (LIBS) chemical analyses, Windjana is representative of the Dillinger and Mount Remarkable members of the Kimberley formation. LIBS data suggest that the Kimberley sediments include at least three chemical components. The most K-rich targets have 5.6% K2O, similar to 1.8 times that of Windjana, implying a sediment component with >40% sanidine, e.g., a trachyte. A second component is rich in mafic minerals, with little feldspar (like a shergottite). A third component is richer in plagioclase and in Na2O, and is likely to be basaltic. The K-rich sediment component is consistent with APXS and ChemCam observations of K-rich rocks elsewhere in Gale Crater. The source of this sediment component was likely volcanic. The presence of sediment from many igneous sources, in concert with Curiosity's identifications of other igneous materials (e.g., mugearite), implies that the northern rim of Gale Crater exposes a diverse igneous complex, at least as diverse as that found in similar-age terranes on Earth.

Glaciers are commonly underlain by deformable till whose mechanical properties and influence on ice flow are not well understood but are critical for reliable projections of future glacier states. Using synoptic-scale observations of glacier motion in different seasons to constrain numerical ice flow models, we study the mechanics of the bed beneath Hofsjokull, a land-terminating ice cap in central Iceland. Our results indicate that the bed deforms plastically and weakens following incipient summertime surface melt. Combining the inferred basal shear traction fields with a Coulomb-plastic bed model, we estimate the spatially distributed effective basal water pressure and show that changes in basal water pressure and glacier accelerations are non-local and non-linear. These results motivate an idealized physical model relating mean basal water pressure and basal slip rate wherein the sensitivity of glacier flow to changes in basal water pressure is inversely related to the ice surface slope.

Deep radiostratigraphy of the East Antarctic plateau: connecting the Dome C and Vostok ice core sites	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Several airborne radar-sounding surveys are used to trace internal reflections around the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica Dome C and Vostok ice core sites. Thirteen reflections, spanning the last two glacial cycles, are traced within 200 km of Dome C, a promising region for million-year-old ice, using the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics High-Capacity Radar Sounder. This provides a dated stratigraphy to 2318 m depth at Dome C. Reflection age uncertainties are calculated from the radar range precision and signal-to-noise ratio of the internal reflections. The radar stratigraphy matches well with the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS) radar stratigraphy obtained independently. We show that radar sounding enables the extension of ice core ages through the ice sheet with an additional radar-related age uncertainty of similar to 1/3-1/2 that of the ice cores. Reflections are extended along the Byrd-Totten Glacier divide, using University of Texas/Technical University of Denmark and MCoRDS surveys. However, core-to-core connection is impeded by pervasive aeolian terranes, and Lake Vostok's influence on reflection geometry. Poor radar connection of the two ice cores is attributed to these effects and suboptimal survey design in affected areas. We demonstrate that, while ice sheet internal radar reflections are generally isochronal and can be mapped over large distances, careful survey planning is necessary to extend ice core chronologies to distant regions of the East Antarctic ice sheet.

Jeffrey			Enhanced thermoelectric properties of the Zintl phase BaGa2Sb2 via doping with Na or K	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												Na- or K-doped samples of Ba1-x(Na, K)(x)Ga2Sb2 were prepared by ball-milling followed by hot-pressing. The topological analysis of the electron density of BaGa2Sb2 implies a polar covalent nature of the Sb-Ga bonds in which the Sb atoms receive the electrons transferred from Ba rather than the Ga atoms. Successful doping of BaGa2Sb2 with Na or K was confirmed with combined microprobe and X-ray diffraction analysis. Alkali metal doping of BaGa2Sb2 increased the p-type charge carrier concentration to almost the predicted optimum values (similar to 10(20) h(+) cm(-3)) needed to achieve high thermoelectric performance. With increasing alkali metal concentration, electronic transport was shifted from non-degenerate semiconducting behaviour observed for BaGa2Sb2 to degenerate one for Na- or K-doped compounds. Overall, the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT, values reached up to similar to 0.65 at 750 K, considerably higher than the undoped sample (zT similar to 0.1 at 600 K), and a slight improvement relative to previously reported Zn-doped samples (similar to 0.6 at 800 K).

Next-generation space logistics paradigms are expected to be more complex, involving multiple exploration destinations and in situ resource utilization. Optional in situ resource utilization brings additional complexity to the interplanetary supply chain network design problem. This paper presents an interdependent network flow modeling method for determining optimal logistics strategies for space exploration and its application to the human exploration of Mars. It is found that a strategy using lunar resources in the cislunar network may improve overall launch mass to low Earth orbit for recurring missions to Mars compared to NASA's Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0, even when including the mass of the in situ resource utilization infrastructures that need to be predeployed. Other findings suggest that chemical propulsion using liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen, lunar in situ resource utilization water production, and the use of aerocapture significantly contribute to reducing launch mass from Earth. A sensitivity analysis of in situ resource utilization reveals that, under the given assumptions, local lunar resources become attractive at productivity levels above 1.8 kg/year/kg in the context of future human exploration of Mars.					de Weck, Olivier/0000-0001-6677-383X												0022-4650	1533-6794				JAN	2016	53	1					25	38		10.2514/1.A33235							WOS:000372469200003

The computational time required to form and solve the equations-of-motion of a simple n-length pendulum using the GPU is compared with a standard serial CPU implementation, a rudimentary parallelization on the CPU using OpenMP, and some combinations of the CPU and the GPU. The hybrid version uses the GPU for a select number of levels in the recursive sweeps and uses an OpenMP parallelization on a multi-core CPU for the remaining levels of recursion. The results demonstrate a significant performance increase when the GPU is used despite recursive algorithms being ill-suited to hardware designed for Single Instruction Multi-Data (SIMD). This is largely due to the tree-type structure of recursive processes, with half of the required operations being contained in the first level of recursion for a binary tree.																			978-3-319-30614-8; 978-3-319-30612-4				2016	42						19	31		10.1007/978-3-319-30614-8_2							WOS:000385278600002

A pervasive role for biomass burning in tropical high ozone/low water structures	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Air parcels with mixing ratios of high O-3 and low H2O (HOLW) are common features in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) mid-troposphere (300-700 hPa). Here, using data collected during aircraft sampling of the TWP in winter 2014, we find strong, positive correlations of O-3 with multiple biomass burning tracers in these HOLW structures. Ozone levels in these structures are about a factor of three larger than background. Models, satellite data and aircraft observations are used to show fires in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia are the dominant source of high O-3 and that low H2O results from large-scale descent within the tropical troposphere. Previous explanations that attribute HOLW structures to transport from the stratosphere or mid-latitude troposphere are inconsistent with our observations. This study suggest a larger role for biomass burning in the radiative forcing of climate in the remote TWP than is commonly appreciated.

Demonstration of a near-IR line-referenced electro-optical laser frequency comb for precision radial velocity measurements in astronomy	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												An important technique for discovering and characterizing planets beyond our solar system relies upon measurement of weak Doppler shifts in the spectra of host stars induced by the influence of orbiting planets. A recent advance has been the introduction of optical frequency combs as frequency references. Frequency combs produce a series of equally spaced reference frequencies and they offer extreme accuracy and spectral grasp that can potentially revolutionize exoplanet detection. Here we demonstrate a laser frequency comb using an alternate comb generation method based on electro-optical modulation, with the comb centre wavelength stabilized to a molecular or atomic reference. In contrast to mode-locked combs, the line spacing is readily resolvable using typical astronomical grating spectrographs. Built using commercial off-the-shelf components, the instrument is relatively simple and reliable. Proof of concept experiments operated at near-infrared wavelengths were carried out at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Keck-II telescope.

Located in aggrading stands in the temperate zone, they have provided a strong foundation for testing critical assumptions in terrestrial biosphere models that are being used to project future interactions between forest productivity and the atmosphere, despite the limited inference space of these experiments with regards to the range of global ecosystems. Now, a new generation of FACE experiments in mature forests in different biomes and over a wide range of climate space and biodiversity will significantly expand the inference space. These new experiments are: EucFACE in a mature Eucalyptus stand on highly weathered soil in subtropical Australia; AmazonFACE in a highly diverse, primary rainforest in Brazil; BIFoR-FACE in a 150-yr-old deciduous woodland stand in central England; and SwedFACE proposed in a hemiboreal, Pinus sylvestris stand in Sweden. We now have a unique opportunity to initiate a model-data interaction as an integral part of experimental design and to address a set of cross-site science questions on topics including responses of mature forests; interactions with temperature, water stress, and phosphorus limitation; and the influence of biodiversity.

Narrow-ridge distributed feedback lasers were developed with plasma-etched sidewall corrugations and infrared-transparent dielectric cladding, enabling fabrication without any epitaxial steps beyond the initial growth of the planar laser wafer. The devices exhibit single-mode emission with stable, mode-hop-free tuning and side-mode suppression greater than 25 dB. We demonstrate packaged single mode devices with continuous-wave threshold power consumption near 1 W above room temperature.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0002-7				2016	9767									10.1117/12.2213990							WOS:000378312100031

The Dark Energy Survey and Operations: Years 1 to 3	OBSERVATORY OPERATIONS: STRATEGIES, PROCESSES, AND SYSTEMS VI	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Observatory Operations - Strategies, Processes, and Systems VI	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an operating optical survey aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe using four complementary methods: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type la supernovae. To perform the 5000 sq-degree wide field and 30 sq-degree supernova surveys, the DES Collaboration built the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square-degree, 570-Megapixel CCD camera that was installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DES has completed its third observing season out of a nominal five. This paper describes DES "Year 1" (Y1) to "Year 3" (Y3), the strategy, an outline of the survey operations procedures, the efficiency of operations and the causes of lost observing time. It provides details about the quality of the first three season's data, and describes how we are adjusting the survey strategy in the face of the El Niflo Southern Oscillation.

Simultaneous Water Vapor and Dry Air Optical Path Length Measurements and Compensation with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer	OPTICAL AND INFRARED INTERFEROMETRY AND IMAGING V	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Optical and Infrared Interferometry and Imaging V	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer uses a near-infrared camera to measure the optical path length variations between the two AO-corrected apertures and provide high-angular resolution observations for all its science channels (1.5-13 microns). There is however a wavelength dependent component to the atmospheric turbulence, which can introduce optical path length errors when observing at a wavelength different from that of the fringe sensing camera. Water vapor in particular is highly dispersive and its effect must be taken into account for high-precision infrared interferometric observations as described previously for VLTI/MIDI or the Keck Interferometer Nuller. In this paper, we describe the new sensing approach that has been developed at the LBT to measure and monitor the optical path length fluctuations due to dry air and water vapor separately. After reviewing the current performance of the system for dry air seeing compensation, we present simultaneous H-, K-, and N-band observations that illustrate the feasibility of our feedforward approach to stabilize the path length fluctuations seen by the LBTI nuller.

Overview of LBTI: a multipurpose facility for high spatial resolution observations	OPTICAL AND INFRARED INTERFEROMETRY AND IMAGING V	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Optical and Infrared Interferometry and Imaging V	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) is a high spatial resolution instrument developed for coherent imaging and nulling interferometry using the 14.4 m baseline of the 2x8.4 m LBT. The unique telescope design, comprising of the dual apertures on a common elevation-azimuth mount, enables a broad use of observing modes. The full system is comprised of dual adaptive optics systems, a near-infrared phasing camera, a 1-5 mu m camera (called LMIRCam), and an 8-13 mu m camera (called NOMIC). The key program for LBTI is the Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial planetary Systems (HOSTS), a survey using nulling interferometry to constrain the typical brightness from exozodiacal dust around nearby stars. Additional observations focus on the detection and characterization of giant planets in the thermal infrared, high spatial resolution imaging of complex scenes such as Jupiter's moon, Io, planets forming in transition disks, and the structure of active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Several instrumental upgrades are currently underway to improve and expand the capabilities of LBTI. These include: Improving the performance and limiting magnitude of the parallel adaptive optics systems; quadrupling the field of view of LMIRcam (increasing to 20"x20"); adding an integral field spectrometry mode; and implementing a new algorithm for path length correction that accounts for dispersion due to atmospheric water vapor. We present the current architecture and performance of LBTI, as well as an overview of the upgrades.

These images will be required in order to determine the key mechanisms for planet formation at the time when processes of grain growth, protoplanet assembly, magnetic fields, disk/planet dynamical interactions and complex radiative transfer all interact - making some planetary systems habitable and others inhospitable. We will present the overall vision for the PFI concept, focusing on the key technologies and requirements that are needed to achieve the science goals. Based on these key requirements, we will define a cost envelope range for the design and highlight where the largest uncertainties lie at this conceptual stage.

PFI will be optimised to provide a complete census of the protoplanet population at all stellocentric radii and over the age range from 0.1 to similar to 100 Myr. Within this age period, planetary systems undergo dramatic changes and the final architecture of planetary systems is determined. Our goal is to study the planetary birth on the natural spatial scale where the material is assembled, which is the "Hill Sphere" of the forming planet, and to characterise the protoplanetary cores by measuring their masses and physical properties. Our science working group has investigated the observational characteristics of these young protoplanets as well as the migration mechanisms that might alter the system architecture. We simulated the imprints that the planets leave in the disk and study how PFI could revolutionise areas ranging from exoplanet to extragalactic science. In this contribution we outline the key science drivers of PFI and discuss the requirements that will guide the technology choices, the site selection, and potential science/technology tradeoffs.

The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) exozodi survey aims at providing a ten-fold improvement over current state of the art, measuring dust emission levels down to a typical accuracy of similar to 12 zodis per star, for a representative ensemble of similar to 30+ high priority targets. Such measurements promise to yield a final accuracy of about 2 zodis on the median exozodi level of the targets sample. Reaching a 1. measurement uncertainty of 12 zodis per star corresponds to measuring interferometric cancellation ("null") levels, i.e visibilities at the few 100 ppm uncertainty level. We discuss here the challenges posed by making such high accuracy mid-infrared visibility measurements from the ground and present the methodology we developed for achieving current best levels of 500 ppm or so. We also discuss current limitations and plans for enhanced exozodi observations over the next few years at LBTI.

The goals of being sensitive to dust emission on solar system scales and resolving the Hill-sphere around forming giant planets can best be accomplished through sub-milliarcsecond imaging in the thermal infrared. Exploiting the 8-13 micron atmospheric window, a ground-based long-baseline interferometer with approximately 20 apertures including 10km baselines will have the necessary resolution to image structure down 0.1 milliarcseconds (0.014 AU) for T Tauri disks in Taurus. Even with large telescopes, this array will not have the sensitivity to directly track fringes in the mid-infrared for our prime targets and a fringe tracking system will be necessary in the near-infrared. While a heterodyne architecture using modern mid-IR laser comb technology remains a competitive option (especially for the intriguing 24 and 40 mu m atmospheric windows), the prioritization of 3-5 mu m observations of CO/H2O vibrotational levels by the PFI-Science Working Group (SWG) pushes the TWG to require vacuum pipe beam transport with potentially cooled optics. We present here a preliminary study of simulated L- and N-band PFI observations of a realistic 4-planet disk simulation, finding 21x2.5m PFI can easily detect the accreting protoplanets in both L and N-band but can see non-accreting planets only in L band. We also find that even an ambitious PFI will lack sufficient surface brightness sensitivity to image details of the fainter emission from dust structures beyond similar to 5 AU, unless directly illuminated or heated by local energy sources. That said, the utility of PFI at N-band is highly dependent on the stage of planet formation in the disk and we require additional systematic studies in conjunction with the PFI-SWG to better understand the science capabilities of PFI, including the potential to resolve protoplanetary disks in emission lines to measure planet masses using position-velocity diagrams. We advocate for a specific technology road map in order to reduce the current cost driver (telescopes) and to validate high accuracy fringe tracking and high dynamic range imaging at L, M band. In conclusion, no technology show-stoppers have been identified for PFI to date, however there is high potential for breakthroughs in medium-aperture (4-m class) telescopes architecture that could reduce the cost of PFI by a factor of 2 or more.

Landsat swath imaging spectrometer design	OPTICAL ENGINEERING												This paper describes the design of a high-throughput and high-uniformity pushbroom imaging spectrometer and telescope system that is capable of Landsat swath and resolution while providing better than 10 nm per pixel spectral resolution over the full visible to short-wave infrared band. The design is based on a 3200 x 480 element x 18 mu mpixel size focal plane array, two of which are utilized to cover the full swath. At an optical speed of F/1.8, the system is the fastest proposed to date to our knowledge. The utilization of only two Dyson-type spectrometer modules fed from the same telescope reduces system complexity while providing a solution within achievable detector technology. Two telescope designs are shown to achieve the required swath and resolution from different altitudes. Predictions of complete system response are shown. Also, it is shown that detailed ghost analysis is a requirement for this type of spectrometer and forms an essential part of a complete design.

S.			Peeling the astronomical onion	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS												Water ice is the most abundant solid in the Universe. Understanding the formation, structure and multiplicity of physicochemical roles for water ice in the cold, dense interstellar environments in which it is predominantly observed is a crucial quest for astrochemistry as these are regions active in star and planet formation. Intuitively, we would expect the mobility of water molecules deposited or synthesised on dust grain surfaces at temperatures below 50 K to be very limited. This work delves into the thermally-activated mobility of H2O molecules on model interstellar grain surfaces. The energy required to initiate this process is studied by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy of small quantities of water on amorphous silica and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces as the surface is annealed. Strongly non-Arrhenius behaviour is observed with an activation energy of 2 kJ mol(-1) on the silica surface below 25 K and 0 kJ mol(-1) on both surfaces between 25 and 100 K. The astrophysical implication of these results is that on timescales shorter than that estimated for the formation of a complete monolayer of water ice on a grain, aggregation of water ice will result in a non-uniform coating of water, hence leaving bare grain surface exposed. Other molecules can thus be formed or adsorbed on this bare surface.

But despite this awareness and the availability of a wide variety of decision models, we found no single model that adequately describes all the ways that decisions can fail and how flawed decisions contribute to mishaps. In this paper, we present our model of decision failure. Then we show how we used this model to gain insight into that decisions that have contributed to NASA mishaps (including the Challenger). This work presents both the model and the insights from its application. The theoretical contribution is a new way to encode and analyze the decision data found in mishap reports, providing insight into the causes of decision failure. The practical contribution is the potential for using this to improve decision-making at NASA and other high -reliability organizations.																	1060-3425		978-0-7695-5670-3				2016							5635	5641		10.1109/HICSS.2016.697							WOS:000432711505085

One source of such is the Software Quality Assurance standard. All NASA sponsored projects are expected to implement these requirements. However given the diversity of projects and practices at different NASA centers it is impossible to a-priori dictate how these requirements are to be economically satisfied on a given project. Under the auspices of NASA's Software Assurance Research Program the authors have been developing a value-based methodology to guide practitioners in defensibly and economically planning and executing assurance effort to satisfy this standard. The methodology exploits the intimate relationship between assurance value and risk informed decision making. This paper describes this relationship, the value-based methodology for scaling assurance efforts, support for using the methodology, and our practice-based validation of the approach.																	1060-3425		978-0-7695-5670-3				2016							5642	5651		10.1109/HICSS.2016.698							WOS:000432711505086

The objective hybrid power system will deliver grid-ready AC power while simultaneously providing thermal energy storage for dispatchable electrical power generation in post sunset conditions. The challenging system level requirements flow-down critical temperature differential and thermal transport requirements to multiple system components and their interfaces. By integrating and demonstrating multiple technologies, the FSPOT-X hybrid power system seeks to efficiently convert photons to electrons maximizing heat transfer efficiency across system element interfaces. These include: I1) capturing all incident sunlight from the solar concentrator in a receiver cavity to maximize energy generation from the CPV cells, 12) extracting PV thermalization heat from the receiver and into the reflux chamber, 13) moving heat from the reflux chamber through the thermal transfer interface, 14) using the thermal transfer interface to shift heat into the TAPC's hot heat exchanger, 15) storing excess unused heat in phase change material, and 16) disposal of waste heat at the system level. For each of these thermal interfaces, effective and efficient technical means are being used and applied in order to maximize overall system efficiency for delivery of a next generation cost-effective and market-ready solar power system.																			978-0-7918-5684-0				2016									V001T03A005								WOS:000374279400017

Titan Science with the James Webb Space Telescope	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC												The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled for launch in 2018, is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) but with a significantly larger aperture (6.5 m) and advanced instrumentation focusing on infrared science (0.6-28.0 mu m). In this paper, we examine the potential for scientific investigation of Titan using JWST, primarily with three of the four instruments: NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI, noting that science with NIRISS will be complementary. Five core scientific themes are identified: (1) surface (2) tropospheric clouds (3) tropospheric gases (4) stratospheric composition, and (5) stratospheric hazes. We discuss each theme in depth, including the scientific purpose, capabilities, and limitations of the instrument suite and suggested observing schemes. We pay particular attention to saturation, which is a problem for all three instruments, but may be alleviated for NIRCam through use of selecting small sub-arrays of the detectors-sufficient to encompass Titan, but with significantly faster readout times. We find that JWST has very significant potential for advancing Titan science, with a spectral resolution exceeding the Cassini instrument suite at near-infrared wavelengths and a spatial resolution exceeding HST at the same wavelengths. In particular, JWST will be valuable for time-domain monitoring of Titan, given a five-to ten-year expected lifetime for the observatory, for example, monitoring the seasonal appearance of clouds. JWST observations in the post-Cassini period will complement those of other large facilities such as HST, ALMA, SOFIA, and next-generation ground-based telescopes (TMT, GMT, EELT).

They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve VOD and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the NASA Aquarius sensor. The global VOD distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved VOD is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The VOD and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band VOD and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

The mechanisms operate at liquid helium temperature in flight. A three-point contact design keeps the mechanical bearings relatively small but allows for a large (305 mm) diameter clear aperture. A worm gear driven by a cryogenic stepper motor allows for precise positioning and prevents undesired rotation when the motors are depowered. A custom-built optical encoder system monitors the bearing angle to an absolute accuracy of +/-0.1 degrees. The system performed well in SPIDER. during its successful 16 day flight.

Theia addresses a number of other science cases strongly synergistic with ongoing/planned missions, such as the nature of compact objects, motions of stars in young stellar clusters, follow-up of Gaia objects of interest. The "point and stare" operational mode will enable Theia to answer some of the most profound questions that the results of the Gaias survey will ask. Extremely-high-precision astrometry at 1-pas level can only be reached from space. The Theia spacecraft, which will carry a 0.8-m telescope, is foreseen to operate at L2 for 3,5 years. The preliminary Theia mission assessment allowed to identify a safe and robust mission architecture that demonstrates the mission feasibility within the Soyuz ST launch envelope and a small M-class mission cost cap. We present here the features of the mission that has been submitted to the last ESA M4 call in January 2015.

It will be optimized for direct imaging and spectroscopy of potentially habitable exoplanets, and will also enable a wide range of general astrophysics science. HabEx aims to fully characterize planetary systems around nearby solar-type stars for the first time, including rocky planets, possible water worlds, gas giants, ice giants, and faint circumstellar debris disks. In particular, it will explore our nearest neighbors and search for signs of habitability and biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars. Such high spatial resolution, high contrast observations require a large (roughly greater than 3.5m), stable, and diffraction-limited optical space telescope. Such a telescope also opens up unique capabilities for studying the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. We present some preliminary science objectives identified for HabEx by our Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT), together with a first look at the key challenges and design trades ahead.

The EBL is the integrated light of all extragalactic sources of emission back to the early Universe. At near-infrared wavelengths, measurement of the EBL is a promising way to detect the diffuse light from the first collapsed structures at redshift z similar to 10, which are impossible to detect as individual sources. However, recently, the intra-halo light (IHL) model is advocated as the main contribution to the EBL, and our new result of the EBL fluctuation from CIBER-1 experiment is also supporting this model. In this model, EBL is contributed by accumulated light from stars in the dark halo regions of low-redshift (z<2) galaxies, those were tidally stripped by the interaction of satellite dwarf galaxies. Thus, in order to understand the origin of the EBL, both the spatial fluctuation observations with multiple wavelength bands and the absolute spectroscopic observations for the EBL are highly required. After the successful initial CIBER-1 experiment, we are now developing a new instrument CIBER-2, which is comprised of a 28.5-cm aluminum telescope and three broad-band, wide-field imaging cameras. The three wide-field (2.3x2.3 degrees) imaging cameras use the 2Kx2K HgCdTe HAWAII-2RG arrays, and cover the optical and near-infrared wavelength range of 0.5-0.9 mu m, 1.0-1.4 mu m and 1.5-2.0 mu m, respectively. Combining a large area telescope with the high sensitivity detectors, CIBER-2 will be able to measure the spatial fluctuations in the EBL at much fainter levels than those detected in previous CIBER-1 experiment. Additionally, we will use a linear variable filter installed just above the detectors so that a measurement of the absolute spectrum of the EBL is also possible. In this paper, the scientific motivation and the expected performance for CIBER-2 will be presented. The detailed designs of the telescope and imaging cameras will also be discussed, including the designs of the mechanical, cryogenic, and electrical systems.

Potential large missions enabled by NASA's Space Launch System	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Large space telescope missions have always been limited by their launch vehicle's mass and volume capacities. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was specifically designed to fit inside the Space Shuttle and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is specifically designed to fit inside an Ariane 5. Astrophysicists desire even larger space telescopes. NASA's "Enduring Quests Daring Visions" report calls for an 8- to 16-m Large UV-Optical-IR (LUVOIR) Surveyor mission to enable ultra-high-contrast spectroscopy and coronagraphy. AURA's "From Cosmic Birth to Living Earth" report calls for a 12-m class High-Definition Space Telescope to pursue transformational scientific discoveries. NASA's "Planning for the 2020 Decadal Survey" calls for a Habitable Exoplanet Imaging (HabEx) and a LUVOIR as well as Far-IR and an X-Ray Surveyor missions. Packaging larger space telescopes into existing launch vehicles is a significant engineering complexity challenge that drives cost and risk. NASA's planned Space Launch System (SLS), with its 8 or 10-m diameter fairings and ability to deliver 35 to 45-mt of payload to Sun-Earth-Lagrange-2, mitigates this challenge by fundamentally changing the design paradigm for large space telescopes. This paper reviews the mass and volume capacities of the planned SLS, discusses potential implications of these capacities for designing large space telescope missions, and gives three specific mission concept implementation examples: a 4-m monolithic off-axis telescope, an 8-m monolithic on-axis telescope and a 12-m segmented on-axis telescope.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-0187-1; 978-1-5106-0188-8				2016	9904								UNSP 99040G	10.1117/12.2233684							WOS:000385794100015

Data Processing and Algorithm Development for the WFIRST Coronagraph: Comparison of RDI and ADI Strategies and Impact of Spatial Sampling on Post-Processing	SPACE TELESCOPES AND INSTRUMENTATION 2016: OPTICAL, INFRARED, AND MILLIMETER WAVE	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Space Telescopes and Instrumentation - Optical, Infrared, and Millimeter Wave	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2016	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE				Direct detection and characterization of mature giant or sub-Neptune exoplanets in the visible will require space based instruments optimized for high-contrast imaging with contrasts of 10-9. In this context, the coronagraph instrument (CGI) on the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will reach raw contrasts of about 10-8 or better using state-of-the-art starlight suppression and wavefront control techniques. A ten-fold contrast improvement is therefore required using post-processing techniques in order to detect 10-9 planets from speckles. Post-processing techniques that are successful on both ground-based and space-based instruments need to be validated at such high contrast levels. In this communication, we investigate speckle subtraction techniques for different observation strategies and hardware parameters on WFIRST-like simulated images in the presence of deformable mirrors and an hybrid lyot coronagraph (HLC). We compare the contrast gain after post-processing in both speckle-noise and photon-noise dominated regimes for two different observing scenarios: the reference star differential imaging (RDI) and the angular differential imaging (ADI). We find that the ADI observing strategy is more robust to speckle and photon noises than the RDI observing strategy, enabling up to a threefold gain with respect to the latter. Thus, we recommend that the telescope be able to roll by at least 13 off nominal. We investigated the impact of spatial sampling on post-processed sensitivity, in the context of design trade studies for the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) component of the instrument. Our preliminary results suggest that the spatial sampling can be halved from the baseline sampling rate (4 lenslets per A/D) without any degradation in final contrast, thereby reducing the integration time required for spectroscopic characterization. In the speckle-noise dominated regime, we also find that at Nyquist sampling or higher, sub-pixel reference to -target offsets have a negligible impact on the level of residual speckles after post-processing.

Materials Outgassing Rate Decay in Vacuum at Isothermal Conditions	SYSTEMS CONTAMINATION: PREDICTION, CONTROL, AND PERFORMANCE 2016	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Systems Contamination: Prediction, Control, and Performance	AUG 31-SEP 01, 2016	San Diego, CA	SPIE				As a laboratory for scientific research, the International Space Station has been in Low Earth Orbit for over 17 years and is planned to be on-orbit for another 10 years. The ISS has been maintaining a relatively pristine contamination environment for science payloads. Materials outgassing induced contamination is currently the dominant source for sensitive surfaces on ISS and modelling the outgassing rate decay over a 20 to 30 year period is challenging. Using ASTM E 1559 rate data, materials outgassing is described herein as a diffusion-reaction process with the interface playing a key role. The observation of -1/2 (diffusion) or non-integers (reaction limited) as rate decay exponents for common ISS materials indicate classical reaction kinetics is unsatisfactory in modelling materials outgassing. Nonrandonmess of reactant concentrations at the interface is the source of this deviation from classical reaction kinetics. A t(1/2) decay is adopted as the result of the correlation of the contaminant layer thicknesses and composition on returned ISS hardware, the existence of high outgassing silicone exhibiting near diffusion limited decay, the confirmation of non depleted material after ten years in Low Earth Orbit, and a potential slowdown of long term materials outgassing kinetics due to silicone contaminants at the interface.																	0277-786X		978-1-5106-0295-3; 978-1-5106-0296-0				2016	9952								995206	10.1117/12.2241212							WOS:000391232000004

It is unclear, however, what underlying mechanisms are responsible for the observed increasing trend of SCA in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Using output data from the Multi-scale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), we investigated how well the SCA of atmosphere-ecosystem CO2 exchange was simulated with 15 contemporary terrestrial ecosystem models during the period 1901-2010. Also, we made attempt to evaluate the contributions of potential mechanisms such as atmospheric CO2, climate, land-use, and nitrogen deposition, through factorial experiments using different combinations of forcing data. Under contemporary conditions, the simulated global-scale SCA of the cumulative net ecosystem carbon flux of most models was comparable in magnitude with the SCA of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Results from factorial simulation experiments showed that elevated atmospheric CO2 exerted a strong influence on the seasonality amplification. When the model considered not only climate change but also land-use and atmospheric CO2 changes, the majority of the models showed amplification trends of the SCAs of photosynthesis, respiration, and net ecosystem production (+0.19 % to +0.50 % yr(-1)). In the case of land- use change, it was difficult to separate the contribution of agricultural management to SCA because of inadequacies in both the data and models. The simulated amplification of SCA was approximately consistent with the observational evidence of the SCA in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Large inter-model differences remained, however, in the simulated global tendencies and spatial patterns of CO2 exchanges. Further studies are required to identify a consistent explanation for the simulated and observed amplification trends, including their underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, this study implied that monitoring of ecosystem seasonality would provide useful insights concerning ecosystem dynamics.

However, the increasing demand for water and diminishing sources have led to groundwater depletion, which occurs when withdrawal rates exceed recharge rates and, therefore, is a problem in several regions of the world under pressure of population growth and climate changes. Because of the lack of sufficient data, it is difficult to estimate and quantify the rate of groundwater depletion regionally and globally, particularly for transboundary regions. However, the new satellite dataset of NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provides a unique approach to estimating changes in groundwater storage. In this chapter, we review the existing studies on GRACE-based estimates of global groundwater depletion in the past decade.

While these problems are in reality continuous control problems, we solve them by searching a discrete space of future actions. Additionally, while the environment is a continuous space, the ocean model we use is a discrete cell-based model. We show that even with an imperfect model of ocean currents, planning in the ocean current model can significantly improve results for a specific problem of controlling a vertically profiling float when a trade-off between remaining at the same location as a virtual mooring and collecting more data with more profiles is available. We also present anecdotal data from an April 2015 deployment of EM-APEX floats.																	2334-0835	2334-0843					2016							431	439									WOS:000492982200052

We use the CSHELL spectrograph (R similar to 46,000) at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF), combined with an isotopic methane absorption gas cell for common optical path relative wavelength calibration. We have developed a sophisticated RV forward modeling code that accounts for fringing and other instrumental artifacts present in the spectra. With a spectral grasp of only 5 nm, we are able to reach long-term radial velocity dispersions of similar to 20-30 m s(-1) on our survey targets.

Reduced major axis approach for correcting GPM/GMI radiometric biases to coincide with radiative transfer simulation	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER												Correcting radiometric biases is crucial prior to the use of satellite observations in a physically based retrieval or data assimilation system. This study proposes an algorithm - RARMA (Radiometric Adjustment using Reduced Major Axis) for correcting the radiometric biases so that the observed radiances coincide with the simulation of a radiative transfer model. The RARMA algorithm is a static bias correction algorithm, which is developed using the reduced major axis (RMA) regression approach. NOAA's Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) has been used as the basis of radiative transfer simulation for adjusting the observed radiometric biases. The algorithm is experimented and applied to the recently launched Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). Experimental results demonstrate that radiometric biases are apparent in the GMI instrument. The RARMA algorithm has been able to correct such radiometric biases and a significant reduction of observation residuals is revealed while assessing the performance of the algorithm. The experiment is currently tested on clear scenes and over the ocean surface, where, surface emissivity is relatively easier to model, with the help of a microwave emissivity model (FASTEM-5).

We analyze the phase matching conditions for frequency doubling and parametric down conversion in the resonators, and find the configurations allowing for simultaneous occurrence of these two processes. Such double phase matching gives us access to a variety of interesting quantum nonlinear optical phenomena. For example, it can lead to antibunched emission of photon pairs through the quantum Zeno photonic blockade.

A multi-paradigm language for reactive synthesis	ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE												This paper proposes a language for describing reactive synthesis problems that integrates imperative and declarative elements. The semantics is defined in terms of two-player turn-based infinite games with full information. Currently, synthesis tools accept linear temporal logic (LTL) as input, but this description is less structured and does not facilitate the expression of sequential constraints. This motivates the use of a structured programming language to specify synthesis problems. Transition systems and guarded commands serve as imperative constructs, expressed in a syntax based on that of the modeling language PROMELA. The syntax allows defining which player controls data and control flow, and separating a program into assumptions and guarantees. These notions are necessary for input to game solvers. The integration of imperative and declarative paradigms allows using the paradigm that is most appropriate for expressing each requirement. The declarative part is expressed in the LTL fragment of generalized reactivity(1), which admits efficient synthesis algorithms, extended with past LTL. The implementation translates PROMELA to input for the SLUGS synthesizer and is written in PYTHON. The AMBA AHB bus case study is revisited and synthesized efficiently, identifying the need to reorder binary decision diagrams during strategy construction, in order to prevent the exponential blowup observed in previous work.
