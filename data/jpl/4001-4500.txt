S	Cheung, KM; Divsalar, D; Bryant, S			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Divsalar, Dariush; Bryant, Scott			Two-Way Ranging and Doppler for Multiple orbiting Spacecraft at Mars	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Mars exploration requires multiple orbiters and surface infrastructures on Mars. Location determination is essential to support various human and robotic activities on the Mars surface and in orbits. A robust communication coverage is required for data transmission between assets on Mars surface and orbiters in addition to the communication between orbiters and Earth. In this paper a notional Mars Regional Navigation Satellite System is proposed that provides continuous or near-continuous in-situ navigation and timing services for the robotic and human missions in the vicinity of a Mars landing site. For such a system the Earth's deep space stations have to perform orbit determination (OD) for the Mars orbiters so that their locations are known to a reasonable degree of accuracy. This provides the user vehicles the ability to estimate their locations using the orbiter-vehicle range measurements. In this paper we introduce a new flight-ground collaborative architecture that provides simultaneous Doppler and ranging for multiple spacecraft in the Mars vicinity. We illustrate the simultaneous ranging and Doppler approach using an example of four Mars orbiters. We assume the two-way ranging and Doppler operate in the X-band frequency range. The operational Deep Space Network (DSN) MultipleSpacecraft-Per-Antenna (MSPA) method is basically a static Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) scheme for spacecraft in the same ground antenna beam. For the four Mars orbiters, the downlinks operate in four allocated frequency bands separated by three guard bands to prevent interferences. The guard bands have to be wide enough to accommodate the Doppler shifts between the frequency-adjacent orbiters. For the uplink, we assume the orbiters share a single X-band uplink, and each orbiter identifies its own commands by its unique spacecraft ID. The uplinks received by the four orbiters exhibit different Doppler and Doppler rate effects due to their different dynamics with respect to Earth. To perform two-way ranging and Doppler measurements a pseudo noise (PN) sequence is transmitted. A method of partial Doppler compensation for each orbiter is employed. Some preliminary results show that 45 KHz and 2.6 Hz/s upper bound the residual Doppler and residual Doppler rate respectively. In this paper we propose a new spacecraft receiver 2-way tracking architecture. A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) with sweeping frequency will be used to coherently acquire and estimate the uplink Doppler frequency on the fly. After Doppler frequency estimation, the PN ranging signal will be acquired and then passively generated to be phase modulated on the downlink X-band carrier frequency. The downlink carrier is generated coherently by PLL from the uplink carrier after applying the turn around ratio and is transmitted at downlink X-Band to the DSN station. Four Receiver Ranging Processors (RRP's) at the ground station again uses PLL with sweep frequency to acquire and to measure the Doppler frequency with some error. After acquiring the PN sequence the ground station then tracks the PN sequence for ranging measurements. This paper sets up a two-way ranging and Doppler system for analysis and simulations. The results will show the accuracy of Doppler measurements to be used for orbit determination of four orbiters at Mars. The use of DSN's Doppler-Rate-Aided Ranging Processing and how it affects the ranging accuracy is discussed. Simulation of ranging is subject of our future paper.

S	Cheung, KM; Lightsey, G; Lee, C			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lightsey, Glenn; Lee, Charles			Accuracy/Computation Performance of a New Trilateration Scheme for GPS-Style Localization	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				We recently introduced a new geometric trilateration (GT) method for GPS-style positioning. Preliminary single-point analysis using simplistic error assumptions indicates that the new scheme delivers almost indistinguishable localization accuracy as the traditional Newton-Raphson (NR) approach. Also, the same computation procedure can be used to perform high-accuracy relative positioning between a reference vehicle and an arbitrary number of target vehicles. This scheme has the potential to enable a) new mission concepts in collaborative science, b) in-situ navigation services for human Mars missions, and c) lower cost and faster acquisition of GPS signals for consumer-grade GPS products. 1. The new scheme is derived from Pythagoras Theorem, whereas the NR method is based on the principle of linear regression. 2. The NR method uses the absolute locations (x(i), y(i), z(i))'s of the GPS satellites as input to each step of the localization computation. The GT method uses the Directional Cosines U-i's from Earth's center to the GPS satellite S-i. 3. Both the NR method and the GT method iterate to converge to a localized solution. In each iteration step, multiple matrix operations are performed. The NR method constructs a different matrix in each iterative step, thus requires performing a new set of matrix operations in each step. The GT scheme uses the same matrix in each iteration, thus requiring computing the matrix operations only once for all subsequent iterations. In this paper, we perform an in-depth comparison between the GT scheme and the NR method in terms of a) GPS localization accuracy in the GPS operation environment, b) its sensitivity with respect to systematic errors and random errors, and c) computation load required to converge to a localization solution.

However, they pose new challenges for exploration. The low gravity, unknown terrain complexity, and desire to go below the surface (ideally to a water ocean) require new robotic mobility systems for viable roving. We present the iterative development of an Ice Screw End Effector (ISEE). Using an actuated alpinist ice screw, the tool can support a 250N load in glacial ice as the hand/foot of a climbing rover while simultaneously extracting 1.4cm diameter ice cores. These smaller, more manageable cores can replace monolithic ice cores for collection in inhospitable terrain where robotic access is required. The collection and analysis of ice cores can explain climate trends, show changes in pollution levels, document extremophile life, and reveal volcanic activity. A sequence of small cores could be collected from various stratigraphic layers by a climbing robot that can ascend sheer ice walls, descend crevasses, or maneuver across the ceilings of ice caves. This low-mass, spatially distributed ice collection strategy presents the opportunity for new paradigms in ice collection, such as 2D grid sampling from ice cliffs, horizontal collection of material along ice strata, and low-impact sampling in biologically sensitive areas. We present the motivation, electromechanical design, and testing results for the ISEE and discuss the findings of the recent deployment of the tool. The required weight on bit for various densities and temperatures of ice tested in the laboratory is presented and a force-control loop for modulating this value is demonstrated. A mechanism for sample transfer is described along with a simple sample caching architecture. Descriptions of the field sites and samples obtained is also included. We outline a path forward for future tool iteration and prospective robotic integration for the next series of deployments.

Electronic Packaging and Passive Devices for Low Temperature Space Applications	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In addition to the challenges of cold operation for active devices, passive devices and packaging materials exhibit changes in electrical behavior as a function of temperature. Results on the temperature dependent behavior of capacitors and substrate materials as a function of temperature and frequency to -185 degrees C will be discussed. These properties may further change if the materials exhibit degradation due to mechanical loading. Whether the electronics are intended to operate at cold temperatures or simply survive exposure to cold temperatures, the packaging technologies between the electronics and the outside world are required to survive multiple extreme low temperature cycles, which combine the challenges of cold temperature exposure and fatigue at low temperatures. To that end, the impact of extreme low temperatures on the mechanical behavior of various key electronic packaging materials will be discussed along with experimental results obtained from several representative assemblies that have been thermally cycled or shock cycled down to -120 degrees C or lower.

Yet, because of the apparent youthfulness of Venus' surface features, long-duration seismic observations are in high demand in order to determine and understand the dynamic processes taking place in lieu of plate tectonics. The Venus Airglow Measurements and Orbiter for Seismicity (VAMOS) mission concept would make use of the dense Venusian atmosphere as a medium to conduct seismic vibrations from the surface to the ionosphere. Here, the resulting atmospheric gravity waves and acoustic waves can be observed in the form of perturbations in airglow emissions, the basic principles for which have been demonstrated at Earth following a tsunami and at Venus with the European Venus Express's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument. In addition, these observations would enable VAMOS to determine the crustal structure and ionospheric variability of Venus without approaching the surface or atmosphere themselves. Equipped with an instrument of modest size and mass, the baseline VAMOS spacecraft is designed to fit within a SmallSat form factor and travel to Venus predominantly under its own power. VAMOS would enter into an orbit uniquely suited for the long-duration, full-disk staring observations required for seismic readings. VAMOS' journey would be enabled by modern solar electric propulsion technology and SmallSat avionics, which allow the spacecraft to reach Venus and autonomously filter observation data on board to detect Venus-quake events. Currently, trade studies are being conducted to determine mission architecture robustness to launch and rideshare opportunities. Key spacecraft challenges for VAMOS, just as with many SmallSat-based mission concepts, include thermal and power management, onboard processing capabilities, telecommunications throughput, and propulsion technology. The VAMOS mission concept is being studied at JPL as part of the NASA Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program, which will not only produce a viable and exciting mission concept for a Venus SmallSat, but will have the opportunity to examine many issues facing the development of SmallSats for planetary exploration. These include SmallSat solar electric propulsion, autonomy, telecommunications, and resource management that can be applied to various inner solar system mission architectures.

S	DiNicola, M; Mccoy, K; Everline, C; Reinholtz, K; Post, E			IEEE	DiNicola, Michael; Mccoy, Kelli; Everline, Chet; Reinholtz, Kirk; Post, Ethan			A Mathematical Model for Assessing the Probability of Contaminating Europa	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Europa Clipper mission must comply with the NASA Planetary Protection requirement in NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR) 8020.12D, which states: "The probability of inadvertent contamination of an ocean or other liquid water body must be less than 1x10-4 per mission". Mathematical approaches designed to assess compliance with this requirement have been offered in the past, but no accepted methodology was in-place to trace the end-to-end probability of contamination: from a terrestrial microorganism surviving in a non-terrestrial ocean, to the impact scenario that put them there, to potential flight system failures that led to impact, back to the initial bioburden launched with the spacecraft. As a result, hardware could presumably be either over- or undercleaned. Over-specified microbial reduction protocols can greatly add to the cost (and schedule) of a project. On the other hand, if microbes on hardware are not sufficiently eliminated, there is increased risk of potentially contaminating another body with terrestrial microorganisms - adversely affecting scientific exploration and possibly conflicting with international treaty. Discussed here is the Icy Bodies Planetary Protection Probabilistic Model, a mathematical model developed by the Clipper Project to demonstrate compliance with the NPR requirement above: Given an initial bioburden launched with the Clipper flight system, the model calculates the probability of inadvertently contaminating the Icy Bodies Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. For purposes of the paper, discussions are focused on contamination of Europa specifically. This model first calculates the probability of the hypothetical event that Clipper fails to perform a planned maneuver and impacts Europa. Then the model assesses the conditional probability at least one viable microorganism survives the impact and reaches the Europa ocean. An initial bioburden launched with the Clipper flight system is provided to the model from the Planetary Protection Equipment List (PPEL). Since there is uncertainty as to which trajectory Clipper would follow to Europa if a maneuver is missed, tens-of-thousands of trajectories are sampled and weighted by their probability of occurrence, given that a particular maneuver is not performed. Flight system reliability and exposure to micro-meteoroids, as pertains to maneuverability, are included in this calculation. Microorganism survival probabilities are calculated along each of these potential trajectories by quantifying microorganism mortality when exposed to the known lethality factors of space such as radiation, temperature and vacuum. The concept of a bio-region is introduced, a critical notion to this modeling which allows us to understand how lethality depends on the flight system design and configuration. This paper will briefly address each of these topics, driving assumptions and areas of uncertainty and conservatism. Preliminary model results are summarized.

The signal processing components required for successful operation are defined. Performance analysis for the uncoded case for N CubeSats is derived. Software simulations are used to obtain the performance of N CubeSats using a coded optical CDMA multiple access scheme. Results from successful completion of this investigation might be used in the future for near-Earth and deep space optical communication scenarios that require science data from CubeSats to be transmitted to Earth. An M-ary Pulse Position modulation (PPM) format is considered. Low phase offset autocorrelation and cross correlation signature sequences are used for spreading. Tradeoffs between the weights, lengths, and maximum number of such sequences are assessed, and their performance with optical PPM modulation is accurately analyzed in the presence of multiuser interference. For a hard decision optical receiver with photon counting detectors, a low rate protograph code is proposed. The code is optimized using the reciprocal channel approximation, which is a one dimensional density evolution. Performance analysis is provided for uncoded and simulated coded optical CDMA under three background noise regimes and for up to N=15 CubeSats and signature sequences of weights 5 and 3. Our results show, for example, that in the case of 2-PPM and using weight 5 signature sequences for a single CubeSat, there is a 7 dB coding gain (with respect to the uncoded case) at a BER of 10(-4), whereas for 15 CubeSats there is a 12 to 15 dB coding gain at the same BER depending on the received background noise intensity. We have demonstrated that with the proposed coding scheme, the loss due to multiuser interference is less than 1 dB for 15 CubeSats. Leveraging existing laboratory hardware to test the deep-space optical CDMA concept, an experiment is performed. Four gain-switched lasers near 1550 nm are combined with a WDM multiplexer to generate 3 channels of CDMA signals plus a background noise channel. CDMA modulation signals are encoded across multiple lasers using a multi-channel logic analyzer. Light is attenuated to the single photon level and measured with a superconducting nanowire single photon detector with time-correlated single photon counting electronics.

S	Dooley, J			IEEE	Dooley, Jennifer			Mission Concept for a Europa Lander	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				A NASA HQ-directed study team led by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with partners including Applied Physics Lab, Marshall Space Flight Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, Langley Research Center and Sandia National Laboratory has recently presented a mission concept for a Europa Lander that would search for bio-signatures and signs of life in the near-subsurface of the Jovian moon. The mission would follow the Europa Clipper multiple-flyby mission, planned for launch in June of 2022, which would provide reconnaissance imagery and other data to the Lander for use in selecting a scientifically compelling site and certifying it for engineering safety. The Europa Lander concept accommodates the Model Payload identified by the Europa Lander Science Definition Team (SDT) and documented in the Europa Lander Study 2016 Report released in February of 2017. The currently envisioned Europa Lander would launch on an SLS Block 1B as early as October of 2025 into a Delta VEGA trajectory, arriving in the Jovian system as early as July of 2030. The baseline design of the integrated flight system includes a dedicated Carrier and Relay Stage, a Deorbit Vehicle composed of a Deorbit Stage consisting of a solid rocket motor (SRM), an MSL-like sky-crane Descent Stage, and a Lander which accommodates the instrument suite. The Lander would be powered by primary batteries over a 20-day surface mission. The science goals envisioned by the SDT require five samples taken from a depth of 10cm, a depth chosen to ensure minimal radiation processing of the potential biomarkers. Mission challenges include the large launch mass, unknown terrain topography, surface composition and materials properties, the high radiation environment, and complying with stringent planetary protection requirements. The mission concept uses a strategy of early risk reduction and overlapping requirements to provide robustness to harsh and uncertain environments. Early risk reduction efforts are aimed at maturing technologies associated with the sampling system, the intelligent landing system, high specific energy batteries, low mass and power motor controllers, and a thermal sterilization system.

JUpiter MagnetosPheric boundary ExploreR (JUMPER)	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			MAGNETOPAUSE	We present the JUpiter MagnetosPheric boundary ExploreR, JUMPER, a Jupiter orbiting SmallSat mission concept to explore the planet's upstream solar wind environment and magnetospheric boundaries and measure the energetic neutral atom (ENA) emissions from its space environment. JUMPER's instrument payload consists of a plasma sensor, a magnetometer, and a neutral atom imager. Measurements from these instruments will complement simultaneous observations of Jupiter's magnetosphere, radio emissions, and/or aurora from a Jupiter orbiting spacecraft (e.g. Europa Clipper, to Observer, JOLT) and/or Earth-based observatories, providing simultaneous, multi-point observations to study the dynamics of this system. JUMPER's science objectives drive several top-level requirements on mission design. The most important is an orbit that extends beyond Jupiter's bow shock and magnetopause on the planet's dayside. Mission design is also constrained by the necessity to ride share on a primary vehicle, preferably until after Jupiter orbit insertion. The JUMPER spacecraft design derives heritage from SmallSats developed for Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)led missions such as those on the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission. The spacecraft design consists of a frame supporting four triple-deployed solar array panels, a propulsion system, and three science instruments positioned to accommodate their field-of-views (FOVs). Embedded within the frame is an radiation vault that will house a majority of the electronics for the spacecraft avionics and payload subsystems. The spacecraft consists of 5 systems: 1) Mechanical, Structural and Thermal (MST) 2) Flight Avionics System (FAS), 3) Electrical Power System (EPS), 4) Communication and Data System (CDS), and 5) Hydrazine Propulsion System (OPS). JUMPER was funded for full mission concept development through NASA's Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program. This paper describes some of the concept study results.

To achieve relevant integration of hardware and software while maintaining rapid algorithm development capabilities and high testing throughput, the Controls and Autonomy for Sample Acquisition and Handling (CASAH) software system was developed. CASAH is an implementation of the Intelligent Robotics System Architecture (IRSA), which mimics JPL Flight Software (FSW) in that it is divided into modules that run separate processes that communicate via message passing, each module is assigned an owner that is a single developer, and the operator initiates requests via a text-based interface that interprets sequences of commands. IRSA enables a modular breakdown of CASAH that follows that of 2020 Flight Software, so developers can take an algorithm from a module in CASAH and re-code it into the same module in FSW. As deployment of CASAH has grown to ten testbeds - each with different hardware and objectives - bottom-up design decisions have been intentionally made to keep the system lightweight and maintainable by a very small team. To date, CASAH has been used to run 1393 different tests. This work describes CASAH, the testbeds and functionality it supports, the tools used to manage the development and sharing of code, and the features of the software. Lessons learned over the past three years of development and deployment are provided.

The Motion Control Subsystem system-level test program was executed to identify potential areas of risk as well as qualify actuators and the Rover Motor Controller Assembly (RMCA). Actuators were tested in a flight-like configuration in a thermal chamber at ambient temperature, +70 degrees C, and -70 degrees C. The tests performed include Winding Resistance, Brake Disengage/Engage, Startup/Halt Sensitivity, No Load, Cogging Profile/Powered Torque Ripple, and Dynamometer. The test setups and methods for understanding results were outlined. Early test results identified areas of risk which resulted in an engineering change: a new RMCA FPGA rate estimator algorithm and changes to the controller conductance loop. The continuation of this testing and future work will inform development of flight software and operational procedure.

Specific areas of investigation include: 1) implementation of "split-pass" relay capability for support to collocated landers, 2) modifications of the extended mission orbit for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission (MAVEN), and 3) introduction of Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) coding. We report here on each of these potential upgrades, quantify the performance implications each would have on future Mars relay services in the context of future mission support scenarios, and provide a status on implementation.

Backward planetary protection (aka, containment assurance) requires "breaking-the-chain of contact" with Mars: any Mars material that would reach Earth would have to be inside a robustly sealed sample container, with a high probability that the container exterior is completely free of Mars dust. Furthermore, the integrity of the sample container would have to be maintained (with an unprecedented degree of confidence) until it is delivered to a secure receiving facility on Earth. NASA's Mars 2020 mission has identified, as one of its four principal objectives, caching of carefully selected samples on the Mars surface for possible return to Earth by a future mission (or set of missions). While no decision has been made as to if or when the future mission(s) might take place, the NASA Mars Exploration Program has initiated a preliminary investigation of mission options and development of technology that could be needed for implementation of the most likely options. This paper briefly describes the status of the ongoing investigation of mission options for potential Mars sample return (MSR) following the collection of samples by the 2020 rover, and focuses on work in progress to develop corresponding break-the-chain technology that would be required for MSR, including notional methods for container sealing, isolation, and sterilization.

Our implementation divides control software into decoupled behavior, user-interface, and hardware-level bus modules. This decoupling at the module level is accomplished by auto-generating human-readable message types that are tailored to the exact hardware topology of whatever system is currently in use. These message types provide modules with a common framework for exchanging state information and relaying commands to devices while being agnostic to the communication protocol itself. We also detail how to structure behavior and bus modules to facilitate modularity and flexibility with third-party software. This software package has been used with success on multiple technology development testbeds at JPL, an example of which is given in this paper, and has proven to provide developers a light-weight and highly reconfigurable system for efficient debugging and practical code sharing.

Progress Towards Flight Software Hybrid Controllers from Formal Specifications	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The manual translation of informally defined requirements into statecharts, from which source code can be generated automatically, can be an error-prone, labor-intensive process. Design errors sometimes propagate into final implementation code, only to be discovered during testing and verification. However, the requirements that the software needs to satisfy can be formally defined via temporal logics. In this paper, an approach to automatically synthesize flight-software hybrid-controllers for dynamic systems from formal specifications is given. First, specifications for a specific control functionality are defined by a set of linear temporal logic formulas. These, together with a model of the dynamical system, are then used as inputs to the Caltech-developed temporal logic planning toolbox (TuLiP), which searches for a control design. This results in a controller that is hybrid as it combines a finite state controller together with low-level continuous control actions. We map the resulting controller design to UML statecharts, which can be given as input to the Statechart Autocoder (SCA) developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. SCA maps statechart controller designs to software implementation C code suitable for flight applications. By construction, the resulting code will meet the original formal design specifications, thus eliminating latent design errors. This paper describes the new 2nd generation interface developed to specify and convert the TuLiP-produced design to more optimized (e.g., reduced number of states and transitions) input UML (as XML file) for the JPL Statechart Autocoder. By applying intermediate optimization procedures, in which indistinguishable states are merged and transitions are grouped, the size of the statechart and the resulting code is reduced substantially. This is demonstrated by revisiting our 2016 speed-controller example showing reduction by more than 75 % of the states synthesized in the original example.	[Haesaert, S.; Murray, R.

S	Hale, AS			IEEE	Hale, Amy Snyder			Juno's Science Planning Process: Development and Evolution Since Launch	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA's Juno spacecraft arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016 after a 5-year interplanetary cruise. In initial concept, Juno's science planning and operations process was extremely simple, with instruments operating in a very repetitive (from orbit to orbit) and non-interactive fashion. That initially simple, non-interactive, planning process has undergone significant changes and enhancements over the course of the project's lifetime, with the most significant changes occurring after launch. Since Juno's launch in August 2011, a new science investigation has been added (the Radiation Monitoring Investigation, which uses Juno's Stellar Reference Units (SRUs) and Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instrument to monitor the Jovian radiation environment), as has a power modeling process that takes into account the details of instrument operation on any given orbit. Additionally, the planned capture orbit was changed from 107 days to two 53.5-day orbits, and the planned science orbit was changed from an 11-day period to a 14-day period. Lastly, a tactical science planning process was developed in order to allow Juno's science teams to make changes to their observation plans from one orbit to the next, a capability that did not exist in the original baseline. Since arrival at Jupiter, the science planning process and timeline has undergone further changes, as the project chose to remain in the 53-day period capture orbit for the entirety of the science mission. In this paper, I will discuss the drivers that led to the significant changes to Juno's initial baseline science planning process that were implemented during cruise, how these new processes were developed, and how they were to be implemented for the instrument teams and the Juno mission system as a whole. Budgetary and human-factor impacts, such as workload considerations, will also be discussed, when applicable. We will discuss the post-Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI) change to Juno's science orbit through the lens of science planning and operations, and discuss how the process Juno currently uses was finally settled on.

With growing availability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open source software, high-altitude ballooning (HAB) has become a viable option for rapid prototyping of ideas in near-space conditions. A product of the Jet Propulsions Laboratory's (JPL) collaborative Innovation to Flight (i2F) program, the Zephyrus system is a proposed HAB solution for high-altitude testing and atmospheric observation, a cheaper and easy-to-use alternative to traditional HAB systems. The Zephyrus system permits testing of small- to mid-sized instruments in the upper atmosphere (approximately 35,000 m maximum altitude) using a reusable common architecture. Over the summer of 2017, the i2F team demonstrated all of these key features of the Zephyrus platform via four test flights. Zephyrus I, II, III, and IV were successfully launched, tracked, and recovered over groundtracks of up to approximately 50 km and altitudes of approximately 30,000 m by a team averaging eight individuals, while accomplishing a majority of the intended science. This included a turnaround time of less than two weeks between two flight tests with differing instrumentation. Lessons from the Zephyrus I flight were successfully used in the Zephyrus II flight to speed up launch time and operations procedures (e.g. rigorous pre-launch preparation). Likewise, the Zephyrus III flight brought the cost of relaunching a mid-sized payload to 28,500 m down significantly. Many diverse instruments and experiments were tested during the Zephyrus missions (e.g. inflatable origami reflectors, flexible solar panels), demonstrating the system's versatility. From concept to first flight of Zephyrus I in just five weeks, followed by turnarounds as short as two weeks, the team demonstrated that it is entirely possible to bring to bear cost-effective, hobbyist HAB techniques in meaningful high-altitude testing using a new reusable test platform.

Assigned for an initial launch date in 2023, the Psyche team was given direction shortly after selection to research the possibility for earlier opportunities. Ultimately, the team was able to identify a launch opportunity in 2022 with a reduced flight time to its destination. This was accomplished in large part to crosscutting trades centered on the electrical power subsystem. These trades were facilitated through the Psyche mission's planned use of Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), which enables substantial flexibility with respect to trajectory design. In combination with low-thrust trajectory analysis tools, the team was able to robustly converge to solutions with a higher fidelity and accuracy of results. These trades also took advantage of the 1300 series product line produced by Space Systems Loral (SSL), which enabled power growth while maintaining strong system-level heritage through its modular design that has been utilized on a large number of geostationary (GEO) communications satellites.

However, when line-of-sight with the mothership is not always available, or for surface rovers that travel large distances, alternative mothership-independent localization techniques may be required. On-board vision-based techniques have demonstrated effective localization in terrestrial applications as well as for Mars rovers, but may be unreliable on small bodies where rovers must contend with fast-moving shadows and issues acquiring images such as dusty lenses, sun blinding, and a rotating field of view. We investigate the feasibility of an entirely new localization approach based on surface gravimetry, where a rover can constrain its location on the surface by precisely measuring the local gravity vector. This mothership-independent localization technique is well-suited to hopping rovers that can bounce and tumble over the surface of small bodies; it is insensitive to surface illumination, and even works at night. We develop a Bayesian framework for computing localization "likelihood maps" from gravimetry data, accounting for all sensor and model uncertainties. We then propose a method for deriving landing distributions of a bouncing rover from simulation data to serve as a prior for the localization estimate. Finally, we conduct a case study on the Philae lander, where we show how this approach could have helped reject localization hypotheses and significantly narrow the search area for the lost Philae lander.

This minimally-functioning state isolates faults, establishes contact with Earth, and orients the vehicle into a power positive attitude until operators intervene. Though 'safings' are inherently unpredictable, mission teams build in time margin during operations to determine root causes and restore functionality. Planning and managing this margin is both critical and enabling on mission architectures dependent on near-continuous operability - such as low-thrust electric propulsion missions. To better quantify the occurrences and severity of safe mode anomalies, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has assembled a database of safings from past and active missions. Currently nearly 240 records are captured from 21 beyond-Earth missions, stemming from a collaboration between teams at JPL, Ames Research Center, Goddard Space Flight Center, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. This paper discusses the event database, explores a statistical approach in modeling the occurrences and severity of safing events, presents a simulation technique, and details recommendations to benefit future concepts.

NUI is capable of operating both autonomously and, with the addition of a hair-thin unarmormed fiber optic tether, as a remotely operated vehicle. We operated NUI in both modes during the expeditions. Overlying ice makes operating robotic vehicles on the sea floor challenging because sea ice moves and ice breakers typically cannot hold station with equipment over the side. Operators on board the ship and the vehicle will drift apart during a mission, often by kilometers. This complicates navigation, communication and recovery. NUI's unique tether enables standoff distances of several kilometers while under direct human control. Autonomous operation and recovery operations in case of tether loss rely on a combination of onboard autonomy and acoustic communication. We report the design and operation of NUI's unarmored microtether, the hybrid control methodology that enables operating the vehicle directly or semi-autonomously and handles forced transitions between modes in case of tether loss, and the use of acoustics for communication and navigation. We conclude by discussing what aspects of the technology already developed for under-ice robotic exploration of deep ocean environments and presented here, would be most readily transferable to future NASA missions.

A Case Study in Attitude Determination and Control on the Cassini Mission to Saturn	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Cassini spacecraft design was such that the instruments were fixed mounted to the spacecraft body which required rotation of the entire spacecraft to point the instruments in the proper direction in order to take observations. The operations of the Cassini optical remote sensing instruments required a high level of spacecraft-pointing stability to minimize image distortion during an exposure window. This case study provides highlights of the Cassini missions, and overviews of the hardware, software, and aspects of the systems engineering and operations approaches. It focuses on the flight performance of the Cassini spacecraft's pointing stability with respect to mission requirements, sources of spacecraft jitter, and the two spacecraft control modes using the reaction-wheel assembly or the reaction control system composed of eight thrusters. It also summarizes the steps that needed to be taken to manage attitude control performance over a 20-year flight operations period.

A cold gas system comprised of a supply tank of gas, a plenum tank, some solenoid control valves, and a small nozzle is proposed to fill this need. This paper summarizes results from an extensive development test program conducted at Mars-like conditions to investigate the performance drivers of such a system. Over 400 tests were conducted at Martian pressure to explore the effect of the working gas mass flow rate, molecular weight, plenum size, ambient back pressure, nozzle design, pulsed operation, and nozzle height above the surface on dust suspension and entrainment. The results of this testing have been used to inform a design for flight. This design has now been baselined to fly on the Mars 2020 rover. An overview of the design is provided along with a discussion of the challenges that have been overcome in order to implement this tool for flight. This includes a discussion of the challenges of designing a system that can withstand temperatures as low as -135 C, the subsequent selection of materials for this application, and thermal cycling test results of candidate solenoid valves.

Flight Plasma Diagnostics for High-Power, Solar-Electric Deep-Space Spacecraft	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA's Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) mission concept plans included a set of plasma and space environment instruments, the Plasma Diagnostic Package (PDP), to fulfill ARRM requirements for technology extensibility to future missions. The PDP objectives were divided into the classes of 1) Plasma thruster dynamics, 2) Solar array-specific environmental effects, 3) Plasma environmental spacecraft effects, and 4) Energetic particle spacecraft environment. A reference design approach and interface requirements for ARRM's PDP was generated by the PDP team at JPL and GRC. The reference design consisted of redundant single-string avionics located on the ARRM spacecraft bus as well as solar array, driving and processing signals from multiple copies of several types of plasma, effects, and environments sensors distributed over the spacecraft and array. The reference design sensor types were derived in part from sensors previously developed for USAF Research Laboratory (AFRL) plasma effects campaigns such as those aboard TacSat-2 in 2007 and AEHF-2 in 2012. ARRM project leadership also encouraged the PDP team to convene a team of topical subject matter experts from across the country to review and confirm the reference design and to consider effective alternatives and/or enhancements to the reference design. This activity was proposed and accepted as an interactive, informal JPL "A-team" study and a cadre of 25 participants gathered in early 2017 for discussions. The outcome of the two-day A-team study was that the PDP reference design would allow the most important induced-environment unknowns to be measured in the appropriate space environment. Another outcome addressed technology developments of new or improved space plasma environmental sensors. The A-team study concluded that selected developments would lead to improved measurements that could efficiently provide important and otherwise unavailable information about plasma thruster operation in the space environment as well as the plasma induced spacecraft environment. Specifically, the A-team group recommended greater sensor diversity, by inclusion of deployed sensor capabilities in the thruster plume, or by occasional gimbaling of the thruster(s) toward the sensor arrays. The A-team also recommended developing high-speed probes, optical plasma probes, energy selective probes, and direct erosion/deposition sensors, among others; and recommended the inclusion of cameras as well as, since ARRM was to be recovered in cis-lunar orbit by a crewed mission, astronaut assessments of thruster induced environments and collection of sample coupons. Overall, the PDP A-team study provided a clear, consensus-supported validation of the reference design PDP approach and pointed out important directions for future flight plasma sensor development.

These positions are referenced to the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame. During Juno's perijove passes the relative positions of the spacecraft and the Jupiter system barycenter are extremely well determined from Doppler tracking by the Deep Space Network (DSN). Combining our VLBA measurements with DSN tracking gives us accurate Jupiter barycenter positions, which in turn can be used to improve our knowledge of Jupiter's orbit (particularly its orientation) as part of the JPL planetary ephemeris. A problem with the main engine has kept Juno in its current 53.5-day orbit instead of the originally planned 14-day orbit. This will extend the mission duration in Jupiter orbit to nearly 5 years, well over 1/4 of Jupiter's orbital period, which in turn will allow us to obtain stronger constraints on orbital inclination and ascending node longitude. DSN range measurements complement the astrometric measurements by providing the best constraints on orbit semi-major axis and eccentricity. We expect to reduce the uncertainty in the orientation of Jupiter's orbit with respect to the International Celestial Reference Frame from approximately 20 milliarcseconds (mas) to approximately 0.2 mas (1 nrad), based on the improvement in Saturn's orbit obtained from similar VLBA measurements of the Cassini spacecraft. Our initial VLBA observations of Juno, combined with the Ulysses flyby in 1992, have already improved the Jupiter ephemeris accuracy by about a factor of 4.

Systems engineers on these types of projects must work with the project scientists to evaluate trades and make decisions that result in a system that efficiently serves the mission science goals. This collaboration is more effective if the systems engineers understand both the traceability from the L1 customer requirements to the selected instruments and the contributions of each instrument in the context of the whole payload suite. These relationships might be understood implicitly by the science team on a project, but there is value in formally codifying them so this understanding can be accessed and formally analyzed by a broader systems engineering effort. We first described a framework for this communication, called the Project-domain Science Traceability and Alignment Framework (P-STAF), in the IEEE 2017 paper "A Framework for Extending the Science Traceability Matrix: Application to the Planned Europa Mission." This paper shows how that basic framework can be leveraged to not only formally capture these relationships between the instruments and the customer needs, but also how that information can be codified in an analyzable graph that can be queried to provide a better understanding of mission risks and scope. This work was drawn from the application of P-STAF to the Europa Clipper mission, but generic example networks are used to illustrate the power of this technique.

The Mars 2020 mission is intended to collect samples which will be sealed in tubes and left on the surface for potential return to Earth by a future mission. This paper studies the problem, autonomous pick-up of sample tubes using a monocular camera attached to a robot's end-effector. We estimate the pose of the tube and the gripper in a single image where both are visible, and compute incremental arm motions based on the relative transformation between the tube and the gripper. To estimate the pose of the tube in the tool-camera frame, we suggest an online sampling-based approach using image gradients in a coarse-to-fine framework. In order to reduce the search space, we employ a biased sampling strategy based on the target shape and projective geometry, and learn promising sampling regions on the fly. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our strategy toward precise Martian sample retrieval.

The OS is part of a concept study for a future mission to return samples from Mars. It is a critical component of such a mission which contains the Mars samples. It would be returned by a separate spacecraft to Earth. The OS will be identified and located by the spacecraft for pick-up from orbit by a beacon signal broadcast via a surface antenna. Several antenna designs were considered, but two promising ones are presented here which have good patterns with a better than 2:1 VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), but meet different criteria for OS design. One is a patch type antenna and the other a slot type antenna. Some data and test results of a fabricated breadboard antenna as well as discussions are provided.

Even when DNA analysis is used to identify strains and genetic population diversity, microscopic imaging is typically used to verify the presence of live organisms and obtain information about their sizes and morphologies. With identified microbes, a variety of microscopic techniques, particularly fluorescence imaging, are used for identification of features such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For identification of microbial life in situ, the challenge is extended to include discrimination of potential live cells from non-living objects of similar size. We present here a survey of analyses that can be made from microscopic images to make this distinction. The techniques include measurement of refractive index, Brownian motion, gravitational settling, autofluorescence, induced fluorescence, and induction of various forms of taxis.

The success of commercial SEP in the global satellite market provides a production base that produces cost-effective hardware. Well-established commercial approaches are in place for scaling and tailoring SEP systems to US government missions. An evolutionary roadmap is discussed, illustrating how these capabilities have emerged from the privately funded commercial technology branching into two new applications to government exploration missions. One is the adaptation for deep space exploration as illustrated by the NASA Discovery class mission to the main belt asteroid 16 Psyche that will use currently-available commercial SEP technologies with only minor modifications. The second enables the emergence of large scale space transportation as embodied by the Power Propulsion Element (PPE), derived from the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) spacecraft concept and planned as the bus foundation of the Deep Space Gateway (DSG). The PPE could use high-power third generation SEP derived from commercial capabilities to transport and maintain large habitats and modules within the Earth-Moon system.

In this paper, we apply the concept of IoT to the airport management industry and investigate the utilization of RFID technology to enhance airport mobility and security. We propose a system to track passengers inside an airport terminal and focus on the optimization of its architecture. To that end, we develop a simulation model incorporating the most important parts of the system, including: An airport model based on Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a passenger trajectory model, a link budget model, a coverage model, a reader placement algorithm, a communication protocol and the limitations of available RFID technology and regulations. Next, we identify a set of architectural decisions, such as the physical limits of the system or the specific technology to be deployed, and develop performance and cost metrics to compare the plausible architectures. Then, based on the developed model and the metrics space, we present the architectural tradespace of the system and analyze the impact each decision has in order to optimize the architecture. Finally, we assess the viability of the chosen architecture in terms of coverage and tracking performance.

Verification of the rovers' spacecraft commands must be performed quickly, implemented robustly, and must consider multiple possible outcomes. In this paper we discuss the architecture behind one component of our system, a software tool named RP-check that evaluates command sequences created by the Rover Planner (RP) team. RP-check is one component of the Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP), our primary tool for commanding and validating the mobility, arm, and turret subsystems on the rovers. RP-check is the spacecraft sequencing equivalent of programming language analyzers like lint 161. It automates the analysis of sequences of commands, evaluating their conformance to best practices described by mission-spanning Flight Rules and Rover Planner team-specific recommendations. It checks hundreds of rules and typically completes its assessment in less than 30 seconds, enabling Rover Planners to continuously validate and refine their command sequences many times a day while planning activities. RP-check owes its success to a simple framework that enables it run quickly and makes it easy to add new rules. Built and maintained by members of the Rover Planner team, new rules and test cases can be validated and deployed quickly to ensure that any issues of concern that arise during operations will be addressed in all future plans.

HabEx is making exoplanet science the primary mission objective and adding two secondary payload instruments for general astrophysics, including ultraviolet spectroscopy. For exoplanet work, two approaches are being developed. The first is a coronagraph with two separate channels to cover a broad spectral range from 450 nm to 1000 nm in two observations. The second is a starshade to cover the band 300 nm to 1000 nm in a single observation. These instruments are complementary; the coronagraph can make rapid survey observations while the starshade can reach closer in to the star and once on target, enables more efficient spectroscopic observations. This paper describes some of the key design considerations necessary to enable coronagraph and starshade observations.

Next-Generation Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator Study	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) have been used to power NASA missions of various types throughout the past five decades. The most recent RTG iteration, used for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, is the Multi-Mission RTG (MMRTG), which is currently the only spaceflight-qualified system available. The U.S. planetary science community has expressed a desire for more power system options to be available to accommodate a range of ambitious future mission concepts across the solar system. Recent advancements in thermoelectric (TE) materials technology have raised a potential for significantly increased efficiency in future RTGs, which helped spur a recent in-depth NASA study of options for future systems. A "next-generation" RTG study was conducted to develop new RTG concepts that could meet the needs of planetary science missions through the 2030s and beyond. A Next-Generation RTG would aim to extend the types of potential NASA missions able to be supported, while fulfilling requirements related to technical risk and schedule. In this study, 21 potential thermoelectric couple configurations were analyzed by considering various high-performance, high-temperature TE materials and segmentation techniques that maximize convertor efficiency and power density. System modularity was explored, and found to be a promising means to offer improved flexibility for NASA mission concepts with varying scope and power requirements. This paper presents the results of the study, demonstrating the viability of developing an updated RTG system design, and defining conceptual system approaches for a new, potentially revolutionary RTG.

While orbital debris poses a threat to spacecraft, a collision between the largest space debris objects is of significant concern. The DARPA Catcher's Mitt study compiled a list of the highest priority large debris objects. By annually removing 5-10 of these high priority objects, it may be possible to stabilize the medium sized debris population. Instead of deorbiting objects, REMORA would use COTS CubeSat components and secondary payload launches as a cost-effective solution for mitigating large debris collisions. The REMORA CubeSat could rendezvous with a piece of debris and use the robotic manipulator to anchor itself to the target object. Once anchored, the CubeSat could track the debris and, if needed, alter the debris object's trajectory to prevent a collision. Aspects discussed include the mission and robotic payload baseline designs. Many of the highest priority objects identified in the DARPA Catcher's Mitt study are located in the 71 degrees-75 degrees inclination range and in sun-synchronous orbit. An initial mission design concept targets sun-synchronous objects due to the large number of launch opportunities to this orbit. The mission was simulated with a combination of MATLAB, GMAT, and STK. A CubeSat robotic payload was designed to provide a decreased chance of collision between the CubeSat and debris object during attachment, augment the ACS during approach, and provide the ability to orient the thrust vector through the center of mass while pushing. This robotic payload includes a computing element, cameras, miniature robotic arm, and end-effector. An initial miniature arm prototype was designed and built to demonstrate feasibility and inform future designs. An end-effector trade study was performed to explore different end-effectors that could be used to for attaching to the common graspable features on large debris objects. Grasping methods, including mechanical prehension, gecko grippers, electrostatic grippers, and magnetic grippers, were investigated.

These missions reveal high intensity energetic particle fluxes at Europa's orbit, requiring a multidimensional design challenge to ensure mission success (i.e. meeting L1 science requirements). Risk averse JPL Design Principles and the Europa Environment Requirement Document (ERD) dictate practices and policy, which if masterfully followed, are designed to protect Clipper from failure or degradation due to radiation. However, even if workmanship is flawless and no waivers are assessed, modeling errors, shielding uncertainty, and natural variation in the Europa environment are cause for residual concern. While failure and part degradation are of paramount concern, the occurrence of temporary outages, causing loss or degradation of science observations, is also a critical mission risk, left largely unmanaged by documents like the ERD. The referenced risk is monitored and assessed through a Project Systems Engineering-led mission robustness effort, which attempts balance the risk of science data loss with potential design cost and increased mission complexity required to mitigate such risk. The Science Sensitivity Model (SSM) was developed to assess mission/science robustness, with its primary goal being to ensure a high probability of achieving Level 1 (L1) science objectives. The understanding of Ll science objective achievement is folded back into the spacecraft, instrument, and mission system design requirements in an iterative fashion. The Science Sensitivity Model development is a cross-Project multidisciplinary effort leveraging, and literally linking, several novel Project products: Mission Science Traceability and Alignment Framework (M-STAF): framework for writing Level 2 (L2) science measurement requirements in an organized and cohesive manner such that a science requirement set is complete and consistent across the instruments [1]. Fault/Reliability Analysis: assesses the probability a recoverable failure occurs on the spacecraft or instrument and the time it takes for the Europa Clipper system to recover. Verification of Europa Requirements Integrating Tour and Science (VERIT aS): model for assessing attainment of L2 science measurement requirements (as specified in M-STAF) for a given trajectory [2]. This tool is used to triage candidate Europa tours and to understand requirement sensitivity if the face of expected outages. Project Science Traceability and Alignment Framework (P-STAF): framework that builds upon the idea of the Science Traceability Matrix (STM) to link L2 science measurement requirements to Ll science measurement requirements, enabling the understanding of instrument dependencies and robustness [3]. This paper will tie these topics together and show how they interconnect to ensure Europa's science objectives are attained in the face of a challenge few deep space missions have encountered.

This modular camera platform is implemented as a suite of two visible-light cameras for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO-3) instrument at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The Internal Context Camera (ICC) and External Context Camera (ECC) provide contextual engineering imaging support for the calibration of the OCO-3 instrument, intended to significantly reduce the duration of the mission's calibration campaign. The OCO-3 mission has taken advantage of the design and qualification work performed by JPL's Mars 2020 Enhanced Engineering Camera (EECam) team in reusing the qualified COTS CMOS imaging sensor, proven electronic designs, and scalable field-programmable gate array (FPGA) firmware to meet OCO-3's mission requirements and resource availability. We will be presenting the steps taken by JPL to design, build, and test the Context Cameras for the OCO-3 mission. We will highlight the design deviations from the Mars2020 EECams and discuss the methodology of tailoring the EECam design for the OCO-3 requirements. Camera imaging capabilities, including focal plane and optical performance, will be presented, as well as a summary of the calibration and environmental test results. Finally, we will discuss the potential for future applications for the Context Cameras.

Recently, 474 RSL-like (>= 1 characteristic) and 69 RSL (all 3 characteristics) sites have been identified and are located in four primary regions of Mars: Chryse and Acidalia Planitiae, Valles Marineras, the Equatorial highlands, and the Southern Mid-Latitudes. There are several hypotheses that explain the origin of RSL, ranging from the motion of dry, granular material downhill, to the presence of underground aquifers. These hypotheses can be partially resolved by proximal (<= 100m) or even distal (>1km) observations. However, complete disambiguation can only be achieved through surface contact science. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently conducted a study into the methods by which a landed asset could access RSL sites to assist in the separation of RSL hypotheses. During this study, 8 of the 69 RSL sites were considered to be landable based on their latitude, elevation, topography, and ability to support an 8 km landing ellipse. In this paper, the accessibility of these sites is detailed through a discussion of their geometry, terrain types, slope and surface roughness. Particular attention is paid to three craters: Selevac, Andapa, and Garni, which were assessed to be strong candidates for scientific investigation. The challenges of accessibility provide the basis for which an assessment of the concepts of operation of 22 architectures is given. Though individually assessed, these concepts can be broadly compiled into balloon, helicopter, missile, and ground ascent/descent groups. First order sizing, power, and mass calculations for each group are detailed along with their advantages and concept specific challenges. The merits of each concept is assessed as a function of the science they enable, technology readiness and feasibility, cost, and risk. A ranking matrix is presented along with selected weightings. Based on the results of the trade study, the highest rated concepts are identified and their next stages of analysis and development are proposed.

The sampling chain consists of the BiBlade sampler, a structural compliant interface to a would-be spacecraft, a 3 degree-of-freedom planar robotic arm, a sample volume measurement device, and two sample vaults. The endto-end sample chain is integrated into a purpose built full-scale dynamic spacecraft emulator, enabling to be performed the full sequence from surface approach to collected sample storage. Touchdown, sample triggering, sample acquisition, and ascent from surface are a critical set of sequences dependent on spacecraft dynamics and the sampler interaction with a comet surface. Of special importance are the rotational and linear inertias provided by the 2200kg spacecraft emulator during TAG operations. The full-scale dynamic spacecraft emulator is intended to validate these complex interactions between the sampler, comet surface simulants, and spacecraft mass. The full-scale dynamic Touch-and-Go spacecraft emulator consists of a 2200kg mass on a frictionless, planar air bearing system, 14 horizontal air thrusters providing 3 degree-of-freedom motion, onboard computing for motion control, and an off-board motion capture system providing localization. This robotic testbed can approach a simulated comet surface in a controlled fashion to validate the BiBlade TAG performance in nominal and offnominal approach velocity scenarios. Following TAG, sample transfer, volume verification, and storage is performed.

Due to planetary protection requirements and the need to position the OS in a preferred orientation for Earth re-entry, the rendezvous phase would present a number of technical challenges. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new end-to-end testbed elements demonstrating new technologies for 1. capture of the OS within the spacecraft, 2. orientation of the OS, and 3. stowage of the OS to a Primary Containment Vessel (PCV) and internal transfer of the PCV within the spacecraft to an Earth Return Module (ERM). The end-to-end testbed consists of a 3 DOF planar robotic arm, a capture cone volume, two interchangeable orientation mechanisms, and two interchangeable internal transfer mechanisms. To simulate zero gravity during the capture stage, a cyber-physical approach is used here that fuses simulation, hardware, and autonomy elements. During the capture stage, contact dynamics of the OS with the capture cone and robotic arm end-effector is simulated using high-fidelity multibody dynamics simulation software in-the-loop. The output of the simulation is used to control the state of the physical OS in real-time using a 3 DOF robotic gantry. Additionally, the end-effector of the robotic arm is equipped with a force-torque sensor and camera to detect contact and track the OS. In the second stage, two novel mechanisms demonstrate successful orientation of the OS. In the first orientation mechanism, wipers sweep the surface of a spherical OS to engage a positive feature, thereby manipulating the OS into a preferential orientation. In the second orientation mechanism, two sets of cups selectively engage and rotate a spherical OS about two orthogonal axes; the mechanism can be operated autonomously using computer vision or interactively with a human operator in-the-loop. Finally, in the third stage, two novel mechanisms demonstrate successful internal transfer of the OS within the spacecraft volume. The internal transfer motion requires 3 DOF (rotation, translation and release of the OS). In the first internal transfer mechanism, each DOF is independently controlled using three actuators. In the second internal transfer mechanism, the 3DOF are coupled mechanically using a single actuator.

An important motivation for developing onboard autonomy is to enable quick response to dynamic environment and situations, including fault conditions that a spacecraft may encounter. The reliability of such autonomous capabilities depends on the quality of their knowledge of a spacecraft's health state. Model-based approaches to fault management, i.e. model-based fault diagnosis (MBFD), is one approach to continuously verify correct behavior in addition to diagnosing symptoms to estimate the spacecraft's health state. The proper functioning of MBFD is dependent on 1) the quality of the model that is analyzed and compared to the outputs of onboard sensors to estimate the system's health state, and 2) the correct functioning of the diagnosis engine that interrogates the model and compares its analysis to observed system behavior. We are currently developing Verification and Validation (V&V) approaches to provide the necessary confidence that MBFD systems are correctly estimating the health of on-board spacecraft components and systems. Our work is intended to narrow the gap between the rapidly maturing field of Model-Based System Engineering (including MBFD) and the less-well understood area of identifying and applying appropriate V&V techniques to MBFD. Our effort is investigating three areas: 1) developing V&V techniques for the diagnostic model, 2) developing V&V techniques for the diagnostic engine in isolation, and 3) developing V&V techniques for the diagnostic engine and model in combination. This paper describes the work we have completed in the first area. We describe our approach to selecting a system to be represented by a model, the approach to modeling the system, the verification approach we developed for the model, and the results of the verification activity. We conclude with a description of the work remaining in the last two areas, which will be addressed over the next two years.

Feasibility of an Innovative Technique for Noise Reduction in Spacecraft Doppler Tracking	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Precise measurements of spacecraft range-rate enabled by two-way microwave links are used in radio science experiments for planetary geodesy. The final accuracies in the gravity field recovery depend almost linearly on the Doppler noise in the link. In this work, we present results of simulations carried out to evaluate the improvement attainable in Doppler measurements using an innovative noise-cancellation technique proposed by Armstrong et al. Hi, using two mission profiles: a representative low-altitude Venus orbiter and the BepiColombo spacecraft. The Time-Delay Mechanical Noise Cancellation (TDMC) technique involves a combination of Doppler measurements collected (at different times) at the two-way antenna and at an additional, smaller and stiffer, receive-only antenna that should be located in a site with favorable tropospheric conditions. This configuration could reduce the leading noise sources in a Ka-band two-way link, such as tropospheric and antenna mechanical noises. We considered a two-way link either from NASA's DSS 25 (in Goldstone , CA) or from ESA's DSA-3 (in Malargue, Argentina) antennas. Moreover, we selected the 12-m Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) in Chajnantor (Chile) as the three-way antenna and developed its noise model according to atmospheric data and mechanical stability specifications available in literature. For an 8-hour Venus orbiter tracking pass in Chajnantor's winter/nighttime conditions, the Allan deviation of fractional frequency fluctuations Delta f/f0 (a measure of the link's frequency stability, thus accuracy) of the simulated TDMC observable at 10-s integration time is 4.5 x 10(-14), to be compared to 1.5 x10(-13) for the two-way link. For BepiColombo, we obtained 1 x10(-13) and 2.6 x 10(-13), respectively for the TDMC and two-way links. If successfully implemented, the use of this noise-reducing technique could be valuable for planetary geodesy missions, where the accuracy in the estimation of high-order gravity harmonic coefficients is limited by tropospheric and antenna mechanical noises, difficult to reduce at the short integration times of interest. The improved orbit determination could be also beneficial whenever high navigation accuracies are required.

Overview and Reconstruction of the ASPIRE Project's SR01 Supersonic Parachute Test	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiments (ASPIRE) project is aimed at developing and exercising a capability for testing supersonic parachutes at Mars-relevant conditions. The initial flights for ASPIRE are targeted as a risk-reduction activity for NASA's upcoming Mars2020 mission. For this effort, two candidate Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute designs are being tested at Mach number and dynamic pressure conditions relevant to Mars2020. The two parachutes under investigation are a build-to-print version of the DGB used by the Mars Science Laboratory and a strengthened version of this parachute that has the same geometry but differs in materials and construction. Starting in the fall of 2017, the parachutes are being tested at deployment conditions representative of flight at Mars by sounding rockets launched out of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF). The first flight test (SR01) of the build-to-print parachute took place on October 4, 2017. During that test, a Terrier-Black Brant sounding rocket delivered a payload containing the parachute pack, the deployment mortar, and the ASPIRE instrumentation suite to a peak altitude of 51 km. As the payload descended back down, an on-board computer calculated an estimate of the dynamic pressure and triggered deployment of the parachute once the targeted test condition was reached. At a Mach number of 1.77 and a dynamic pressure of 453 Pa, the 21.35-m parachute was deployed. The parachute deployed and inflated successfully, producing a peak measured load of 30.95 klbf. The onboard instrumentation suite included a GLN-MAC IMU, a GPS unit, a C-band transponder for radar tracking, three load pins at the parachute triple bridles, and three high-speed/high-resolution cameras trained on the canopy during inflation. In addition, the atmospheric conditions at the time of flight were characterized by means of high-altitude meteorological balloons carrying radiosondes. These data allowed the reconstruction of the test conditions, parachute loads, and parachute aerodynamic performance in flight. The imagery from the onboard cameras will allow the reconstruction of the three-dimensional geometry of the canopy during inflation. This paper describes the SR01 flight test and provides an overview of flight operations, the data acquired during testing, the techniques used for post-flight reconstruction, and the reconstructed performance of the test vehicle and parachute system.

The challenge is even greater for missions which have highly dynamic power generation and consumption profiles, and harder still for those which also have a multitude of instruments with unique, episodic, observation profiles. Indeed, that is the very challenge faced by the systems engineers on the Europa Clipper project and its ten instruments. Past solutions to such problems have relied on a variety of metrics: average or maximum energy utilization, peak power utilization, a worse case energy balance, battery state of charge, and many others. In this paper, we will describe why none of the previous approaches were found to be sufficiently suitable and why that led to a novel approach which defines a representative energy usage in statistical terms. This resulted from the need to concurrently satisfy five separate criteria: 1) the payload allocation must be used to size the spacecraft power generation and storage system; 2) the payload allocation must be suballocated to each instrument; 3) instruments must be able to verify and report against their allocations without the need to run observation profile simulations; 4) the payload allocation must be based on the Europa Clipper Design Reference Mission; 5) allocations must be reasonably immune to variations in future tour designs. While the need to meet each of these criteria may seem obvious, ensuring that a single metric can satisfy all five simultaneously is not. In addition to describing the method and the thinking behind it, the paper will also show how it was applied to the Europa Clipper project, with a focus on the payload, and how it successfully met all the criteria in the presence of changing observation profiles and tour designs.

Although current methodologies adequately performed in past missions (e.g., Rosetta, Hayabusa, Deep Space), they are not suitable for applications requiring a high level of autonomy. This work proposes a method for autonomous orbit selection and adaptation around a small body while mapping its surface. In particular, in this work, we will develop cost functions that quantify the orbit goodness in the sense of map improvement. In other words, we develop quantitative measures that characterize the accuracy of the small body map and use these measures in an optimization process to compute the next best orbit that maximally contributes to the map enhancement. The proposed framework reduces the human involvement in this process and takes a step toward the fully autonomous mapping and navigation around small bodies.

The paper discusses the Universal Space Transponder - Ka-band Modulator (UST-KaM) developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission, which is capable of transmitting up to 1.74 Gbps with 7/8 LDPC encoding. The UST-KaM utilizes OQPSK with both baseband and RF filtering to contain the 1 Gsps transmission spectrum within the 1.5 GHz Ka-band, even with the use of an external, saturated amplifier. Due to the high data rates involved, several technical hurdles were overcome in both the digital and RF designs. The UST-KaM is a software defined radio with two digital circuit board assemblies: a low speed housekeeper board for commanding and telemetry, and a high-rate signal processing board known as the Signal Processing Module (SPM). The SPM receives data from the spacecraft via a SERDES interface at up to 2 Gbps, processes and encodes the data using a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA, and produces 1 Gsps OQPSK I and Q waveforms via synchronized, multiplexed DACs. The RF Electronics in the UST-KaM employ a heterodyne architecture in which the I/Q digital waveforms are filtered and then up-converted using a sub-harmonic IQ mixer. The LO of the converter, which is included in the exciter assembly, is at 13.125GHz, and the RF output is a 26.25GHz carrier which is modulated with the OQPSK waveforms. The output of the mixer is then filtered using low loss quartz thin-film edge coupled Chebyshev filters and amplified through a series of low gain Ka-Band amplifiers. The exciter assembly also has a 2GHz, low-phase-noise, PLL synthesizer to supply the clock to the DACs for the high rate digital waveforms.

EVA Swab Tool to Support Planetary Protection and Astrobiology Evaluations	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				When we send humans to search for life on other planets, we'll need to know what we brought with us versus what may already be there. To ensure our crewed systems meet planetary protection requirements-and to protect our science from human contamination-we'll need to assess whether microorganisms may be leaking or venting from our spacecraft. Microbial sample collection outside of a pressurized spacecraft is complicated by temperature extremes, low pressures that preclude the use of laboratory standard (wetted) swabs, and operation either in bulky spacesuits or with robotic assistance. A team at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently developed a swab kit for use in collecting microbial samples from the external surfaces of crewed spacecraft, including spacesuits. The Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Swab Kit consists of a single swab tool handle and an eight-canister sample caddy. The design team minimized development cost by re-purposing a heritage Space Shuttle tile repair handle that was designed to quickly snap into different tool attachments by engaging a mating device in each end effector. This allowed the tool handle to snap onto a fresh swab end effector much like popular shaving razor handles can snap onto a disposable blade cartridge. To disengage the handle from a swab, the user performs two independent functions, which can be done with a single hand. This dual operation mitigates the risk that a swab will be inadvertently released and lost in microgravity. Each swab end effector is fitted with commercially available foam swab tips, vendor-certified to be sterile for Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A microbial filter installed in the bottom of each sample container allows the container to outgas and re-pressurize without introducing microbial contaminants to internal void spaces. Extensive ground testing, post-test handling, and sample analysis confirmed the design is able to maintain sterile conditions as the canister moves between various pressure environments. To further minimize cost, the design team acquired extensive ground test experience in a relevant flight environment by piggy-backing onto suited crew training runs. These training runs allowed the project to validate tool interfaces with pressurized EVA gloves and collect user feedback on the tool design and function, as well as characterize baseline microbial data for different types of spacesuits. In general, test subjects found the EVA Swab Kit relatively straightforward to operate, but identified a number of design improvements that will be incorporated into the final design. Although originally intended to help characterize human forward contaminants, this tool has other potential applications, such as for collecting and preserving space-exposed materials to support astrobiology experiments.

One technique well suited to 3-d volume searches is digital holographic microscopy, in which a coherent reference beam is combined with the light scattered by the particulates and/or microbes present in a sample volume to produce an interference pattern (the hologram) on a detector array. As the detected hologram encodes both the amplitude and phase of the scattered field on the detector plane, the electric field at any plane within the sample volume can be reconstructed by numerically propagating the field information contained in the measured hologram, thereby eliminating the need for any mechanical focusing elements. In fact, digital holographic microscopy has several advantages, including instantaneous 3-d volume imaging, high spatial resolution, large depth of field, large field of view, and intrinsic data compression due to the encoding of the entire volume into a 2-d hologram. Moreover, rapid readout can also enable the tracking of particle motions, which can aid in discriminating between inert particulates and living cells. With no need for mechanical focusing, digital holographic microscopes allow for robust and stable designs. In particular, very promising off-axis digital holographic microscope (DHM) designs include both the "common-mode" DHM, and the "lensless" DHM. A common mode DHM has recently performed very well in the field, with reliable performance and sub-micron resolution. On the other hand, the lensless DHM configuration holds the promise of minimal instrument volume and mass, as the optical system can consist of no more than a pair of coherent high-numerical-aperture single-mode light sources that expand through a sample volume to a detector array. Even this simple configuration has been recently shown to be capable of providing a resolution of just under a micron. Moreover, in some lensless DHM configurations, very large fields of view can also be provided. This paper describes the imaging capabilities of lensless digital holographic microscope configurations, both in theory and in practice.

The increasing challenges of space exploration, particularly by humans, rapidly become unaffordable if only Earth-based resources are available. The Asteroid-Provided In-Situ Supplies (Apis (TM)) spacecraft extracts resources from NEOs. A crewed lunar outpost in an energetically advantageous lunar orbit is used for storage and propellant processing and reusable spacecraft are used for crew and cargo transport. This creates a space transportation system where these resources can be utilized to support crewed lunar surface exploration, crewed NEO exploration, crewed Mars missions, and even space tourism at less than 25% of the cost otherwise estimated for the current approach. (similar to 90B$ vs. similar to 390B$ over 20+ years.) This analysis further suggests that with relatively modest initial government investment, a business case can be developed for a profitable industry in space resources.

This Earth-orbiting radar mission, which will be launched from Sriharikota (India) in December 2021 in a nearpolar, sun-synchronous orbit, is designed to systematically and globally study solid Earth, ice masses, and ecosystems. Following NISAR' s launch, the first 90 days will be dedicated to performing 'in-orbit checkout', or the 'commissioning' period, during which there will be a step-by-step buildup in capability to full observatory operations. Activities performed during commissioning will be aimed at demonstrating the full functionality of the radar instruments (L-band and S-band), the reflector antenna, spacecraft and flight systems, characterizing and confirming their nominal performance within specifications. All ground systems and infrastructure, including Ground Data Systems (GDS), Science Data Systems (SDS) and Mission Operations Systems (MOS), as well as the compatibility of all system interfaces, will be tested and validated. Calibration strategies for monitoring instrument stability will be tested during initial instrument calibrations. The scheduling of these initial instrument calibration activities takes into account factors like the satellite orbit and attitude after launch, requirements on specific instrument configurations for operation, required ground targets and the corresponding number and frequency of overflight times during a satellite repeat cycle (12 days). A timeline for NISAR instrument checkout that takes into account these factors and constraints is presented in this paper.

Yet many in the space community believe that returning humans to the moon is more logical. Often-cited reasons for this include: (1) should Nature prove to be favorable, the moon could be the basis for expanding the space economy through Off-Earth Mining (OEM) and other commercial endeavors; (2) the moon is scientifically interesting and could serve as a platform for scientific facilities; and (3) useful experience could be gained there for the human journey to Mars. With this in mind, JPL's A-Team (Architecture Team) was tasked with developing conceptual lunar surface architectures that could simultaneously provide "living on another world" proving ground experience, but would also be affordable and offer truly significant commercial and international partnering opportunities. The task also required that the resulting architectures must eventually lead to and flow seamlessly into planning for human missions to Mars in the 2030s/2040s, if "things go well." This aspect has been critically missing in other lunar architecture proposals. For continued NASA investment in any future human exploration architecture, affordability is a political imperative. This translates into managing the magnitude of the public investment by NASA in lunar infrastructure while doing those things that governments can do to stimulate new economic opportunities there. The menu of such potential strategic investments include: (1) engaging in science and exploration (e.g., Lewis and Clark); (2) reducing economic risks and resolving some technical uncertainties to create tipping points and real options for space entrepreneurs; (3) performing R&D/DDT&E and first buys of basic systems/services; (4) building public (lunar) infrastructure (e.g., roads, navigation aids, basic communications, logistics nodes, operational knowledge/de-confliction); and (5) acting as an anchor tenant. While incorporating these strategic elements into the architecture development as a way to encourage private sector development of the space economy and international partner contributions, the A-Team also recognized that both off-ramps and on-ramps (and periodic decision points) were needed to ensure that public goals for human space exploration were being met. Key questions might include: (1) are private investors coming on board; and (2) are we ready to go to Mars? In this paper, we present and describe the A-Team's lunar architecture that meets the requirements set out above using a high-level system-of-systems architectural view, which we call a "dance card." We then process the information in the dance card into an affordability view, commonly called a "sand chart." The method and model used for this is described in some detail, along with the sources of data. Lastly, we discuss the extensive commercial opportunities, which include in situ resource utilization (ISRU), cargo logistics, tourism, utilities for lunar activities, and construction, as well as the international partner contribution opportunities embodied within the architecture. We also review the viability of these commercial opportunities based on previous research.

Each sub-array has two polarizations, namely vertical and horizontal (or 0 degrees and 90 degrees). The design uses a multi-layer structure such that the Ka-band (35 GHz) array is embedded within the empty space provided by a 2x2 Ku-band (14 GHz) sub-array. The feeding networks for both arrays are etched on the same substrate layer without overlapping of the transmission lines, while adequate space is provided to incorporate amplifier chips directly onto the network. The proposed array has similar radiation patterns at both frequencies with high gain and large front-to-back ratio. Adequate space for integrated phaseshifters is provided for beam steering and a proof-of-concept digital calibration scheme. The array is fabricated on a stack of PCB milled substrates. Measurements of scattering parameters are performed and matched the simulations. This array is compact and offers additional functionality compared to traditional single frequency and/or single polarization designs, and is suitable for airborne and small-satellite remote sensing applications.

Although not currently habitable, Venus lies within the Sun's `Goldilocks zone', and may have been habitable before Earth [2]. What caused Venus to follow a divergent path to its present hostile environment, devoid of oceans, magnetic field, and plate tectonics that have enabled Earth's long-term habitability? The proposed Venus Origins Explorer (VOX) would determine how the evolution of Earth's twin diverged, and enable breakthroughs in our understanding of terrestrial planet evolution and habitability in our own solar system - and others. The VOX mission concept consists of two flight elements: 1) an Atmosphere Sampling Vehicle (ASV), and 2) an Orbiter that accommodates the ASV and also provides global reconnaissance of Venus using just two instruments and a gravity science investigation. The ASV would be released shortly after Venus Orbit Insertion and dips into the well-mixed atmosphere at 112 km. It delivers an in situ atmospheric sample to the Venus Original Constituents Experiment (VOCE) to measure noble gases, revealing the source and evolution of Venus' volatiles. The Orbiter uses the Venus Emissivity Mapper (VEM) to map global surface mineralogy and search for active or recent volcanism. Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (VISAR) generates long-awaited high-resolution imaging and digital elevation models, and possible deformation maps with repeat-pass interferometry, a new tool for planetary science. Ka-band tracking increases the gravity field resolution, enabling global elastic thickness estimates. Using a low risk implementation and just three instruments plus gravity science, VOX conducts a comprehensive global investigation of Venus' dynamic surface. As described below, VOX meets and exceeds the science objectives prescribed in the National Academy of Sciences most recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. VOX is the logical next mission to Venus because it: 1) addresses top priority atmosphere, surface, and interior science objectives; 2) produces key global datasets to enable comparative planetology; 3) provides high-resolution global topography, composition, and imaging necessary to optimize future landed missions; 4) creates opportunities for revolutionary discoveries and observations of ongoing Venus geological activity, over a three-year period from an orbital platform plus an in situ atmospheric sampling vehicle; and 5) fuels the next generation of scientists by providing 44 Tb of science data. Additionally, VOX offers NASA the ability to select and fly small sats at Venus by providing relay and the ability to trade aerobraking duration for additional mass capability.

Concurrently, the payload will undergo a suite of Verification and Validation (V&V) activities in order to demonstrate that the payload has met the project requirements. These activities will also demonstrate launch readiness and ultimately mission readiness to quantify variations in the column averaged atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction, XCO2 from the International Space Station (ISS). Operating from the ISS has its own set of advantages and challenges. One of the aspects of operating on the ISS includes going through a distinctive verification and validation process unique to ISS payloads. This process includes the use of the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Verification of Engineering Requirements - Interface for Tracking, Approval and Submission (VERITAS) system to facilitate multiple center interactions and review of interface requirements. In this paper we will discuss how the OCO-3 V&V Program architecture interfaced with the ISS payload interface V&V program to show that the mission requirements were met.

Commercial off the shelf (COTS) components would be advantageous to use for some aspects of such projects, given that they are easier to procure and offer a broad range of functionalities. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental data suggest that many COTS parts are capable of operation, and not just storage, at temperatures well beyond the manufacturer specified temperature limits. To help address the challenges presented at near cryogenic temperatures, a COTS selection knowledge base is being developed to estimate the performance of COTS components within cold environments. The knowledge base captures queries from a range of information sources such as cold functionality test results for part types and families, theoretical and experimental literature reviews and key findings are summarized here. In addition, a selection of components are planned to be examined for their performance to near cryogenic temperatures to generate a methodology for identification and verification of the COTS candidates. As the qualification of COTS parts for extreme environments can be very costly, this knowledge base can serve to reduce qualification time and cost by pre-selecting and limiting candidates.

S	Stephens, SK			IEEE	Stephens, Stuart K.			Juno at Jupiter: The Mission and Its Path to Unveiling Secrets of the History of the Solar System	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Juno mission is described, focusing on its orbits at Jupiter, how the plan evolved, and science return so far. Juno is a NASA New Frontiers spacecraft in a near-polar highly elliptical 53-day orbit at Jupiter. Since arrival in July 2016, it has used 9 science investigations to study the planet's atmospheric composition and structure, magnetic and gravity fields, and polar and extended magnetosphere. A radiation monitoring investigation contributes to our understanding of Jupiter's environment. Juno's primary science goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter, to shed light on how the Earth and other planets formed. Baseline objectives will be satisfied with 32 science orbits, a spin-stabilized solar powered spacecraft, an electronics vault for radiation shielding, and a robust payload with microwave receivers, X-and Ka-band radio science hardware, vector magnetometers, high-and low-energy charged particle detectors, radio and plasma wave antennas, UV and IR spectroscopic imagers, and a visible light camera for public outreach. Observations are made in a limited number of orientations, including Gravity Science (spin axis and main antenna pointing to Earth), and microwave atmospheric sounding (spin plane passing through Jupiter's center). Prime science data are collected near closest approach (perijove), plus calibrations, occasional remote sensing, and continued magnetospheric observations in the outer parts of the orbit. Juno's mission plan has evolved since the 2005 proposal due to design and ops choices, e.g., mission design (cruise or early orbital trajectory), orbit period (11, 14, then 53 days), perijove attitudes (2 or more), and DSN coverage (34- and 70-m stations). Choices were partly motivated by the effect on science return. Selected preliminary science results are summarized, including the benefits of decisions as the plan evolved. Juno has begun to unveil Jupiter - peeling apart its interior by measuring gravity and magnetic fields, using microwaves to probe its atmosphere down to 100s of km, exploring its polar and extended magnetosphere, and imaging the poles for the first time. In doing so, it is revealing secrets of the history of the Earth and solar system.

S	Sternberg, D			IEEE	Sternberg, David			Multiple Model Trajectory Generation for Uncertain Target Spin Direction	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Multiple concepts have emerged that require the docking of two or more spacecrafts, including autonomous robotic servicing and assembly of orbiting assets, and the active removal of space debris. Successful dockings require that the Target's spin rate and direction be determined so that approach trajectories may be computed. Remote sensing from ground stations or distant satellite observations can provide important data for the Chaser satellite, such as the spin rate or amount of tumbling by the Target. Optical light curves are a basic method of determining the period of a Target's rotation. To avoid recomputing the approach trajectory based on updated spin rate or direction data and reduce the computational complexity required to generate a fuel efficient approach trajectory, a means of generating trajectories robust to the spin direction must be developed. This paper presents the multiple model approach, in which training models representing potential spin rates and directions are weighted by their likelihood of representing the true behavior of the Target, for synchronous trajectories. While not fuel or time optimal, the synchronous multiple model trajectory keeps the docking location in the field of view of the Chaser's rendezvous sensors throughout the trajectory while trading performance from the nominal model for robustness across a range of models. Further, the Targets in this analysis are taken to be rigid, uncooperative, and passively tumbling. The paper presents the application of the multiple model approach to docking trajectory generation. In doing so, it compares both the optimal approach trajectory and robust, multiple model trajectory for uncertainty in the spin direction. This paper also assesses several tuning parameters that engineers may use to trade the computational complexity, fuel cost, and robustness of the resulting multiple model trajectory for use in future missions. The processes discussed in the paper therefore can be applied to additional future mission scenarios beyond the case study of a single Chaser approaching a single Target.

S	Sturm, EJ			IEEE	Sturm, Erick J., II			Cassini's Grand Finale: A Mission Planning Retrospective	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				On September 15, 2017, Cassini plunged deep into Saturn, down to where the atmosphere was sufficiently dense to destroy the spacecraft, making it part of Saturn forever. In the five months leading up to its destruction, Cassini flew between Saturn and its rings 22 times, collecting data from the never-before-explored region of the Kronian system. These orbits, the Grand Finale of Cassini, were the culmination of years of planning by the Cassini flight team. This paper looks back upon the mission planning effort in particular, comparing the baseline operational scenarios and contingency plans to the as-flown Grand Finale. The bulk of the Grand Finale mission planning effort was focused on the environmental hazards present in the region between Saturn and its rings: the dust and the atmosphere. Dust hazard and atmospheric transit contingency plans were in place to help ensure spacecraft health and maximize science data return. The dust hazard plan gave the operations team the option to turn the spacecraft to a safe attitude during ring-plane crossings had the dust environment proved more threatening than anticipated. The atmospheric transit plan would have made use of an orbital trim maneuver in order to raise or lower periapsis depending on the density of the atmosphere. The proximal environment did have its surprises, though they were good surprises. The dust was significantly less hazardous than predicted. So much so that elements of the contingency plan were leveraged in order to remove a dust hazard protection from the baseline plan, rather than add one to it. While the atmosphere was substantially denser than predicted, it was not dense enough to warrant a periapsis-raise maneuver and actually meant that better in-situ data was gathered. Ultimately, from a mission planning perspective, the Grand Finale went better than expected.

S	Tanner, CL; Clark, IG; Chen, A			IEEE	Tanner, Christopher L.; Clark, Ian G.; Chen, Allen			Overview of the Mars 2020 Parachute Risk Reduction Activity	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) landed safely on the surface of Mars using a supersonic Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute, which was structurally qualified for flight via a subsonic wind tunnel test program. Results of the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerators (LDSD) program have called into question the methodology and principles that form the foundation of the MSL subsonic test program. LDSD discovered that quasi-static subsonic proof loading a parachute via ground testing may not provide canopy stresses that sufficiently bound the stresses experienced during a rapid supersonic inflation at Mars. Additionally, deeper scrutiny of the materials and structural margins present in previously successful supersonic DGBs indicated that the MSL parachute flew with lowest margins of any previous parachute. These factors have increased the perceived risk of reusing a heritage MSL DGB parachute design with a subsonic test program for Mars 2020. To reduce this risk, a series of risk reduction steps were initiated starting in 2016. First, two parachute assemblies have been pursued in parallel: a Build-to-Print (BTP) MSL parachute, designed and manufactured by Pioneer Aerospace Corporation, which maintains the heritage of the successful MSL parachute, and a strengthened parachute, designed and manufactured by Airborne Systems North America, which uses higher strength materials throughout the parachute assembly but maintains the same overall size as the MSL parachute. Second, each parachute system was tested in a subsonic wind tunnel to examine the canopies in their fully inflated state and assess the workmanship of each canopy. Finally, full-scale parachutes from each vendor will experience at least one supersonic inflation at Marsrelevant Mach numbers and atmospheric densities at Earth via a supersonic sounding rocket test campaign. This paper presents high-level details regarding the risk reduction strategy, the two candidate parachute configurations, the ground test program, and the supersonic flight test program, and brief results from each of the test programs.

The comet sample object area is illuminated by ten bundles of illumination fibers that are separated from the imaging fiberscopes. Two LED illumination sources provide switchable sample illumination that can be individually adjusted for different sample conditions. The FiSI fiberscope was validated in an environmental chamber for a wide temperature range of -170 degrees C to +70 degrees C. Moreover, the FiSI prototype was tested on a parabolic aircraft flight to validate operation in simulated microgravity. During 60 parabolic maneuvers, the FiSI system operated flawlessly and obtained images of different types and quantities of samples including dusty comet sample simulants. The FiSI prototype was successfully demonstrated in a relevant thermal and microgravity environment and it is now validated to TRL 6.

While the wheels were designed to operate with considerable damage, the rate at which damage was occurring was unexpected and raised concerns regarding wheel lifetime. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has now developed and deployed new software on Curiosity that reduces the forces acting on the wheels. Our new Traction Control algorithm adapts each wheel's speed to fit the terrain it drives over. It does not rely on any a priori knowledge of the terrain, and instead leverages the rover's measured attitude rates and suspension angles, together with a rigid-body kinematics model, to estimate the real-time wheel-terrain contact angles and ideal, no-slip wheel angular rates. In addition, free-floating "wheelies" are detected and autonomously corrected. In this paper, we describe the algorithm, its ground testing campaign and associated challenges, and finally its validation and performance in flight. Ground test data demonstrates reductions in the forces acting on the wheels and validates the wheelie-damping capability. Secondary benefits in some terrains include a reduction in heading deviations while climbing rocks, with a reduction in slip in certain sandy terrains. Preliminary validation from flight data confirms these findings.

The SWOT mission will provide large-scale data sets of ocean sea-surface height resolving scales of 15km (in ocean wavelength) and larger, allowing the characterization of ocean mesoscale and submesoscale circulation. Present altimeter constellations can only resolve the ocean circulation at ocean wavelengths larger than 200km. SWOT will address fundamental questions on the dynamics of ocean variability at wavelengths shorter than 200km, which encompasses mesoscale and submesoscale processes such as the formation, evolution, and dissipation of eddy variability (including narrow currents, fronts, and quasi-geostrophic turbulence) and their role in airsea interaction. The SWOT mission will also provide measurements of water storage changes in terrestrial surface water bodies and will provide estimates of discharge in large (wider than 100m) rivers, globally. The SWOT measurements will directly measure the surface water (lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and wetlands) component of the water cycle. The core of the SWOT payload consists of a Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn) - a dual-antenna synthetic aperture radar specifically designed to make high precision height and backscatter measurements enabling the key oceanographic and hydrology data sets. The SWOT payload also includes: a Nadir Altimeter (NA) system, a radiometer for tropospheric path delay corrections, and a precision orbit determination instrument suite consisting of Global Positioning System-Payload (GPSP), Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) receivers, and a Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA). SWOT is a partnership mission between NASA, the French Space Agency (CNES), The United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA), and The Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The spacecraft bus and command & data ground stations are provided by CNES, while the launch vehicle and payload module are provided by NASA/JPL. The SWOT payload module instrument suite consists of the NASA/JPL provided KaRIn instrument, cross-track radiometer, GPS, and laser retroreflector, as well as the CNES provided DORIS and nadir pointing radar altimeter. CNES also provides the Radio Frequency Unit (RFU) sub-system for which the UKSA contributes the Duplexer assembly. The RFU is a key subsystem of the KaRIn instrument. CSA contributes the Extended Interaction Klystron (EIK) which is one of the KaRIn subsystem. This paper describes the mission design, implementation of the Payload, and some of the interface and design challenges.

S	Walsh, W; Gao, J			IEEE	Walsh, William; Gao, Jay			Communications in a Cave Environment	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Lava tubes are thought to exist on Mars and on the Moon, and are of special interest for science objectives and human habitability. The communications environment in such a cave is important for exploration. This paper explores the use of the shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) approximation to modeling the electromagnetics environment in a basalt rock lava tube with an obstruction, such as a cave-in. The cave, which has smooth walls, widens until the obstruction occurs, and then narrows. There is no line-of-sight communications path. A cave length of 100 meters is modeled. Existing knowledge of tunnel communications and the ANSYS Savant tool are leveraged in order to provide results for the cave geometry. A number of observations are offered in the following areas based on indications obtained from lava tube modeling: (1) Enhanced signals are observed. This is the degree to which the cave walls can create an amplification of the received signal and assist communications by reflecting the incident and re-scattered signals. Communications behind the obstacle is possible. (2) Spatial signal fading was observed, hinting at geometric effects or that scattered signals can combine destructively. Deep fades occur but appear to be rare. (3) Diminished signal strength occurs at the boundaries. Robotic exploration may take place close to the cave floor or walls. Indications from simulation for signal strengths close to the cave floor and walls are examined. (4) Frequency-selective fading can occur. The time-delay spread is discussed. The simulation results include an evaluation of IEEE 802.11 WiFi at 2.4 GHz using a freestanding electric cross dipole antenna and transmitted signal powers from 10mW to 100mW. Receive data rates are derived at locations throughout the cave and are provided to the degree that the cave geometry and electromagnetics approximations hold. These are only estimates of actual data rates subject to the approximations that were applied. Simplifications and adaptations of the WiFi waveform are discussed as part of a power trade.

This technology is an improvement over the technology that is currently used in space applications, which lags behind state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment by several generations. SoC technology integrates all computational power required by next-generation space exploration science instruments onto a single chip. This paper describes hardware/software co-verification tools for the Xilinx Zynq-based control and data handling system that have been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for visible-infrared imaging spectrometers.

During a steep slope traverse, a rover consumes more power and is exposed to higher risks of getting stuck or of overturning. It is essential for a rover to autonomously recognize and avoid steep slopes for efficient and safe operations. Existing techniques (e.g. stereo vision) do not completely address challenges in planetary exploration, such as low-textured terrain appearance and computational resource limitations. This paper presents a novel slope estimation method using a monocular infrared camera. The proposed method estimates slope normals based on surface temperatures on two different slopes. The surface energy model is employed to correlate thermal properties to geometrical properties of the terrain. The idea behind this approach is that the solar radiation, which is a major energy source for terrains, can differ by time, slope angles and directions. The difference in energy input generates the gap of surface temperatures between target and reference surfaces, which can be remotely detected with an infrared camera. The proposed method avoids the problem of terrain appearance as it only uses temperature measurements, and is also computationally efficient thanks to efficient preprocessing. The algorithm is validated through simulations and outdoor experiments. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to estimate terrain slope normals solely from temperature measurements.

There are different strategies, motivations, and implementations for hibernation. For example, hibernation was important for the Rosetta mission because of its limited spacecraft resources when the spacecraft ventured to far reaches of the solar system near the orbit of Jupiter. The NASA New Horizons probe to Pluto, on the other hand, is an example of a mission's use of hibernation with a goal to decrease the level of operations, while at the same time reducing spacecraft wear and tear. In the same way, the designers of the other missions using hibernation addressed in the paper, such as Deep Space 1, Spirit, WISE, Stardust/NEXT, and some DoD and NOAA missions, have all benefitted in unique ways from the use of the hibernation technique. The authors hope the summary of the techniques used and lessons learned in implementing hibernation in the described missions will prove valuable to other spacecraft designers whose missions may similarly benefit from the use of this mode.

This paper describes a solar-powered multi-vehicle concept that can turn water resources obtained from mid-latitude glacier ice into a sustained water supply. A robotic drilling platform is proposed that can access relatively pure water ice in mid-latitude Martian glaciers through 1-10m of loose regolith, whereupon long-distance tanker rovers continually traverse terrain between the drilling operation and human outposts located in Mars equatorial zones. Robotically deployed solar-thermal panels will be able to passively heat warm water that is delivered into a Rodriguez Well (a melted cavity in an expanse of water ice such as a glacier). Newly melted water will be pumped up out of the well and cycled through the solar panels to fill tankers. The tankers will consist of multiple four-wheeled linked cars in a tram-like configuration that can overcome steep terrain and obstacles. The system will be able to deliver its own landed mass of water to the human explorers every similar to 74 Mars days. The resources, power, vehicle configurations, and detailed functions are described.	[Wilcox, Brian H.; Howe, A.

Avoiding the Impossible: Re-focusing a Non-Feasible Mission 2-Hrs into a 3-Day Engineering Session	2018 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2018	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Concurrent engineering (CE) has demonstrated for over twenty years that it can produce high level mission designs in a short period of time, from months to only a few days. Unfortunately, sometimes these designs - while technically sound - are not feasible due to mass or cost constraints. A major new capability is needed by CE teams that will enable mission designers to re-focus a study, and avoid spending a great deal of time and effort with 15 engineers designing a non-feasible mission. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Team X is addressing this problem by developing mass and cost models that produce estimates for the probability of breaching a mass or cost threshold within the first hours of a study. These models are built on statistical relationships based on mass and cost allocations per mission component by mission type, derived from over twenty years of Team X studies and NASA missions. By linking these relationships, insights about total mass or cost can be made early in a study, based on preliminary requirements or the first completed spacecraft subsystem designs; estimates incorporate updated spacecraft subsystem designs as they are completed throughout the study. A methodology, generalized model, verification and example implementation for a cost limit breach are presented.

Dual channel and limited capacity principles of learning were incorporated into the format of the systems engineering tools developed to assist with information processing and retention. Metacognitive strategies associated with memory and creative idea generation were implemented into the methodology to effectively and efficiently develop system alternatives using the full collection of knowledge.

An analysis of the system functions, requirements, interactions, and constraints was performed. A trade study was carried out on relevant technologies, and a set of evaluation criteria was developed to help determine the most feasible concepts for implementation. The MArs CApture and ReOrientation for the potential NExt Mars Orbiter (MACARONE) concept is proposed as a promising system architecture for the ROCS Capture and Orient Module (COM). The concept uses a sliding trap door for Orbiting Sample (OS) capture, a Motorized Cups Mechanism for OS orientation, and a 2 DOF Turret Arm with a paddle for transferring the OS into a containment vessel. This approach facilitates modularity, development flexibility, testability in a 1G environment, analyzability without the need to simulate or test for 0G contact dynamics, ability to encapsulate potential dust surrounding the OS, and ability to be ejected to reduce the probability of Earth exposure to unsterilized Mars material.

Reaching Europa's ocean requires penetrating through up to 30km of partially cryogenic ice, salts, and frozen sulphuric acid. There are two primary methods of penetrating ice: mechanical and thermal. Each of these methods has unique advantages and disadvantages but neither are sufficient to reach the ocean independently. SLUSH Drill (Search for Life Using Submersible Heated Drill) is a hybrid drilling system that combines the best features of mechanical and thermal probes. It uses both energy-efficient mechanical drilling to cut through dirty cryogenic ice (e.g. ice with sediment or salt) and thermal power to partially melt ice cuttings into slush. This slush allows cuttings to flow out of the way and refreeze behind the probe. Once SLUSH passes through the cryogenic layer (similar to 5km thick), it can melt through the warm ice underneath without the need for mechanical cutting. SLUSH is a self-contained probe with on-board electronics and instruments. It has several Pu-based heat sources (General Purpose Heat Source) to keep itself warm and melt the ice cuttings. Electrical power and communication is transmitted by the surface lander, via an umbilical stored within the probe which unspools and freezes in the ice.

The ability to estimate missing data allows motion planners to create more aggressive and cost efficient paths. Previous approaches in applying GPR to terrain estimation have large computational complexity or trade off accuracy of farfield data with computational complexity. We present Multiresolution Partitioned Gaussian Process Regression (MPGPR) to address these weaknesses. MPGPR improves upon past results by 1) using a quadtree structure to intuitively partition data in order to speed up parameter optimization times, as well as 2) using a hierarchical structure to capture long range data dependencies while preserving local detail. This hierarchical structure allows the method to perform well on practical datasets that may have nonuniform densities. Our method is evaluated on many artificially generated terrains as well as real data obtained from the Mars Curiosity Rover.

Although flux pinning dynamics have been studied from a material-science perspective and at an interface level, there is a need to better understand the sensitivities and implications of system-level designs on the flux-pinned interface dynamics, especially in designs with multiple magnets and superconductors. These interfaces have highly nonlinear, coupled dynamics that are influenced by physical parameters including but not limited to strength of magnetic field sources, field-cooled position, and superconductor geometry. This paper addresses that gap by codifying parametric terms into an improved dynamics model, which can then be used to simulate the interaction of a multiple-superconductor-multiple-magnet interface. A standard starting point for modeling flux pinning dynamics is Kordyuk's frozen image model, which defines a geometric mapping between magnetic field sources and their corresponding magnetic point source "images inside the volume of the superconductor." The frozen image model successfully approximates the characteristics of flux pinning dynamics, but could provide more precise position and orientation predictions with the addition of various physical parameter refinements. The sensitivity of the general flux-pinned dynamics model is studied by varying the physical parameters and simulating the systems level dynamics. A predictive dynamics model is crucial to the maturation of this technology so it can be utilized in spacecraft systems, and this work represents a critical step in the development of that model.

Each of these motions can be performed while maintaining a small form factor. The low profile locomotion is made possible via peristalsis, a locomotion method in which waves of circumferential and longitudinal contraction propagate in a retrograde manner (opposite to the direction of motion) down the length of the animal's many-segmented body. We have previously tested peristaltic locomotion on planar surfaces, but here we explore additional actuators in a smaller form factor for bending a pre-fabricated mesh body with nitinol shape memory alloy springs. This new robot, MiniWorm, has a minimum diameter of 1.7 cm, is capable of moving forward at a speed of 0.88 cm/min and can lift its front segment 1.5 times its diameter. We show that without lifting, the robot cannot cross even very small obstacles (14% of diameter), but that a head-lifting gait enables this motion.

This provides compelling motivation to develop solar cells and arrays that are highly efficient in low irradiance low temperature (LILT) environments. We give several examples of the iterative process our team has employed to develop cell designs that optimize the performance at LILT. We also provide results on advanced-architecture devices that have already demonstrated very high efficiencies in the Jupiter and Saturn LILT and radiation environments, specifically four-junction inverted metamorphic and triple-junction upright metamorphic solar cells, respectively.

Given limited budgets, staffing resources, and a time critical need for repair or enhancement, there is an ever-present temptation to sacrifice quality for higher productivity or slip release target to ensure better quality. We have learned that poor management of this increases risk of mission failure. As a result, our process must be both highly productive and maintain high quality (e.g. reliability, maintainability, usability). Inspired by the "quality is free" paradigm, we have instituted a set of "Rapid Release" maintenance process policies and measures aimed to continually manage productivity and quality. Six Rapid Release polices were established from well-known engineering principles and best practices to address specific issues of concern encountered in the development phase. However, due to the critically of our systems, we must have objective assurance that our developers are following the six policies and that they are demonstratively effective in addressing the areas of concern. Goal: Investigate if Rapid Release as currently implemented is effective in achieving effects and impacts as expected from principles and best practice beliefs. Additionally, determine practical methods to assure compliance and performance to Rapid Release policies and determine if any adjustments to policy or practice is needed. Method: We have over 15 years of reliable and accurate quality and productivity process data for Monte, a critical system currently in continual operation and maintenance. Time series cross-correlation analyses on this data is used to compare process productivity and quality characteristics pre- and post-implementation of Rapid Release. Results: We find strong evidence, that for Monte: (1) there is continual risk due to productivity and quality tradeoffs, (2) the majority of the Rapid Release policies are being complied with, and (3) the policies have been effective in managing this risk. Conclusions: High productivity and high quality in maintenance of our critical systems requires more than implementing policy based on belief. The process must be monitored to assure that policies are adhered to and are effective in producing the results desired.

Tasks are performed through a supervised autonomy framework that makes efficient use of operator input, 3D scene reconstructions, automated motion planning, and parameterized behaviors. The limb must robustly interact with its environment to perform tasks such as turning a subsea valve or inserting a hot stab. The limb features high power density actuators and a 6 degree of freedom force torque sensor. A custom 3-function robotic gripper mounted to the force torque sensor allows dexterous yet robust interaction with underwater task panels. The system includes capabilities to detect and autonomously respond to any leaks or motor faults by disconnecting motor power when the system is in an off-nominal state and notifying the operator through LED lighting on the Light Lids that seal the actuator assembly housings. This highly capable robotic limb serves as a testbed for JPL development of technologies for autonomous operation of mobile manipulation systems.

The ocean-world science puzzle - which may reveal whether life is widespread in the cosmos, why it exists where it does, and how it originates - can only be solved by exploring all of them. Potential life in these places could not have shared our origins, yet these worlds contain the only evidence about life that we can touch, essentially forever. Thus, their exploration has existential significance. Planning a multiworld exploration campaign would be a multi-generational undertaking. The technical challenges are diverse and formidable, far harder than at Mars: missions to the Jovian and Saturnian ocean worlds are severely power-limited; trip times can be more than a decade. And the science targets are global-scale oceans beneath kilometers of cryogenic ice. Today, we lack the instrumentation, subsystems, and machine-intelligence technologies needed. A systematic OWEP (ocean worlds exploration program) strategy can make most effective use of funding and time. The three priority ocean-world targets are Europa at Jupiter, and Enceladus and Titan at Saturn. Five hypothetical programmatic scenarios are compared to the default case. A coherent OWEP should have several parts: first, dedicated continuous investment in enabling technologies; and second, two directed-purpose, medium-class (similar to$1B) missions per decade that conduct pivotal investigations on a documented roadmap. A robust OWEP would cost about 1/40th more per year than NASA's current budget.

The advanced SMT packages included commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) column grid array (CGA), leaded thin small outline (TSOP), leadless quad flat no-lead (QFN), and passive technologies. Tin-lead eutectic solders were used for soldering; they were either in paste form for assembling SMT packages or solid wire for hand soldering plated-through hole (PTH) for PGA ceramic packages. It is a general perception that the PTH technologies are an order of magnitude more robust in thermal cycle reliability than SMTs. However, this may not be true under extreme cold environmental conditions. Design for reliability (DfR) may requires compromising the stand-off height of PGA assembly and the thickness of printed circuit board (PCB) to achieve the desired long-term reliability. This paper presents the key parameters affecting the reliability of SMT package assemblies including TSOP, QFN, CGA, and PGA assemblies as well as associated test results under standard and extreme cold harsh thermal shock/cycle conditions. The standard thermal cycle conditions for high-reliability applications included were in the range of (-55 degrees C to 100 degrees C) and (55 degrees C to 125 degrees C) whereas extreme cold cycles were harsh (-135 degrees C to 70 degrees C) and (-120 degrees C to 85 degrees C), or milder (110 degrees C to 20 degrees C). Test results presented include non-destructive optical/SEM and X-ray images and daisy-chain resistances as well as destructive failure analyses performed by X-sectioning. Finally, key findings for various packaging technologies under extreme cold thermal cycles are presented.

Although liquefaction vulnerability is controlled by geologic and groundwater conditions, its regional assessment is almost exclusively based on geologic material properties or proxies thereof. In this work, we are developing a multivariate methodology that incorporates groundwater conditions by introducing hydrological variables in regional assessment of liquefaction hazards. More specifically, we use remote sensing data and well-monitoring data to set up an integrated hydrological model that provides estimates of soil moisture and depth to water table. We demonstrate the methodology by presenting a case study from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake in Imperial County. We use reconnaissance data to train a logistic regression model, which yields probabilistic maps of liquefaction occurrence. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed approach may improve the modeling of regional liquefaction assessment at no additional site investigation cost. However, in order to draw quantitative conclusions on the accuracy improvements, more training data is necessary for which we are collaborating with the ARIA Center at JPL-Caltech.

With the advent of large-capacity and partially reconfigurable FPGAs, partitioning has been proposed at the System-on-Chip (SoC) level. However, fixed hardware partitions in a SoC, such as those in slotted reconfigurable architectures, are not effective in coping with permanent chip damage provoked by cumulative space radiation, the reason being that a single damaged on-chip resource in one partition can prevent the use of that entire partition. In this paper, we discuss how to use R3TOS (Reliable Reconfigurable Real-Time Operating System) to implement a dynamically-partitioned computing platform on a Xilinx Zynq SoC that processes science data delivered by a NASA Fourier transform spectrometer. Unlike in related approaches, R3TOS avoids fixed partitions by harnessing the Zynq's configuration memory for exchanging data among the partitions. This enables us to achieve higher levels of flexibility in the spectrometer avionics, which results in a more effective capability to withstand chip damage. We have simulated different chip damage scenarios and checked that an R3TOS-based prototypic avionics system can tolerate on average around 13% more on-chip damaged resources than a traditional fixed slotted solution.

This technology is an improvement over the technology that is currently used in space applications, which lags behind state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment by several generations. SoC technology integrates all computational power required by next-generation space exploration science instruments onto a single chip. This presentation will describe a Xilinx Zynq-based data acquisition, cloud-screening and compression computing system that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for JPL's Next Generation Imaging Spectrometers (NGIS). The Xilinx Zynq-based Alpha Data hardware assembly fits into a 120mm by 190m by 40mm assembly and uses 9 watts at peak performance. The computing element is a Xilinx Zynq Z7045Q which includes a Kintex-7 FPGA (equivalent to 3 RAD Virtex5 FPGAs in terms of logic cell resources) and dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 Processors (equivalent to 10 RAD750 Power PCs in term of processing capability).

Along with the traditional software based (CPU) execution, FPGAs are now also emerging as a bright prospect to accomplish such routines. However, these platforms are often get plagued by faults generated due to the high radiations in such environments. As a result, the real-time applications running on the platform could also get jeopardized. Thus, efficient execution of a set of hard real-time applications on reconfigurable systems with anomaly detection and recovery mechanism is inevitable. This work aims at tackling such problem with a "healing" approach for extreme environments. Initially, the applications are intelligently partitioned for hardware and software execution, then attempts have been made to schedule hardware applications with intermittent preemption point. Upon detecting any abnormality on such distinct points, our approach orchestrates a healing mechanism to remediate the scenario without hampering the pre-determined schedule. Experimental validation of our proposed method reveals its effectiveness.

However, as space networks grow in size, the process of obtaining routes and forwarding traffic becomes both computationally expensive and challenging, thus limiting the overall scalability of the system. This problem becomes critical when routing is executed in resource-constrained on-board computers. While most of previous works have focused on optimizing data delivery performance, we propose two mechanisms to improve the computation effort and scalability of the routing procedure at the expense of an acceptable decrease in performance. Results from simulations of realistic satellite networks provide evidences on the trade-off in different cases.

Several routing algorithms have been presented in the literature to address the needs of such networks, most of them implementing variants of controlled network flooding in the hope of successful data delivery. In this note, we compare the results of previous routing algorithms with Opportunistic Contact Graph Routing (OCGR), an enhanced version of Contact Graph Routing (CGR) that is suitable for networks where contacts cannot always be scheduled ahead of time. To perform the benchmark, we simulate a network of nodes moving in a certain space according to the Random Waypoint Mobility Model, and then take measurements of bundle delivery probabilty and overhead ratio as metrics of performance and cost respectively. Through this exercise, we demonstrate that the performance of OCGR is highly dependent on the type of network under consideration (e.g. very sparse vs. densely connected) and the assumed mobility model.

Auto-Gopher-2-An Autonomous Wireline Rotary Piezo-Percussive Deep Drilling Mechanism	EARTH AND SPACE 2018: ENGINEERING FOR EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial International Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments (Earth & Space)	APR 09-12, 2018	Cleveland, OH	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Aerosp Div			ULTRASONIC/SONIC DRILLER/CORER	Drilling deep into the subsurface of planetary bodies in the Solar System for samples acquisition enables critical capabilities for future NASA exploration missions in its quest to understand the origins of the Solar System and potentially the search for life. Such planetary bodies as Mars and Europa are key targets for potential missions that would require reaching great depths. Performing drilling while using minimal mass/volume systems and with low energy consumption are the main requirements that are imposed on such technologies. A wireline deep drill, called Auto-Gopher-2, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary piezo-percussive deep drilling mechanism that combines formation breaking by rotating and piezoelectric actuator hammering and cuttings removal by rotating a fluted bit. The hammering mechanism is based on the ultrasonic/sonic drill/corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate ball-shape free-mass to transform high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The lessons learned from the previous studies are being implemented into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings and sample management and drive electronics. Subsystems of the wireline drill are being developed in parallel at JPL and Honeybee Robotics, Ltd. Issues related to the bit and its ability to retain the cuttings for caching and removal are currently being addressed. This paper presents the development efforts of the piezoelectric actuator, cuttings removal and retention flutes, and drive electronics.

Introduction to Tools and Techniques for Surface Sampling on Europa	EARTH AND SPACE 2018: ENGINEERING FOR EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial International Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments (Earth & Space)	APR 09-12, 2018	Cleveland, OH	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Aerosp Div				The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is studying excavation and collection of a sample from an icy surface for a potential landed mission to Europa. Europa presents unique challenges in planetary sampling. Very little is known about the local topography and material composition of the surface. The environmental conditions of being cryogenically cold (80-130 K), low gravity (similar to 1/7th Earth), no atmosphere, low lighting conditions, and limited ground in the loop opportunities have forced JPL to look at sampling differently than past missions. Interacting with the surface of the Jovian moon requires a sampling system that is robust to local topography on the scale of the lander and/or the tool. In addition, the sampling system must be capable both of detecting faults and automatically adjusting to them to achieve the mission objectives without ground in the loop feedback. Presented here is an overview of a sampling system concept that involves a two-stage approach for collecting a sample. The first stage uses an excavation tool to prepare the surface site for sample collection by removing the top layer of irradiated material and clearing tailings from the hole. The second stage then generates and collects a sample for delivery to instruments on-board a lander. Also presented is an introduction for how autonomy and sensing technologies might be employed to enable mission success.

The objective of the planned Europa Clipper mission is to gain insight into the key ingredients for this potentially habitable world. This mission will conduct investigations using a suite of instruments that includes a set of five remote sensing instruments, four in situ fields and particles instruments, and a two-channel ice-penetrating radar. Among its science objectives are to produce high-resolution images of Europa's surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing activity, measure the thickness of the ice shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa's ocean. Europa Clipper is expected to encounter a very challenging environment, particularly in radiation. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the challenging environments and the environmental requirements that are levied onto the Europa Clipper system design. The mitigations activities being conducted or planned to ensure compliance with the severe environments will be described. Also discussed will be how the environmental requirements are verified and at which level of integration to ensure mission success.

Combined with longer-term challenges of rising sea levels attributed to coastal subsidence and steric expansion, impacts from these events are expected to increase, especially in the lower Chesapeake Bay in Portsmouth and Norfolk, VA. In 2017, NASA's Earth Science Disasters Program hosted a regional workshop to explore these issues with particular focus on coastal Virginia and North Carolina, given impacts that NASA's Langley Research Center and the community of Hampton Roads had experienced from several past events. The workshop brought together partners from academia including: Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Old Dominion University, Hampton University, George Mason University, and the University of Alabama. These universities partnered with emergency management and scientists from NASA among other partnering federal agencies to explore capabilities among the team that could improve understanding of the physical processes related to these hazards, their potential impact to these changing communities, and identify methodologies for supporting emergency response and risk mitigation. A pilot demonstration research initiative was developed to examine coastal hazards in two communities adjacent to the James River and Elizabeth River: Portsmouth, VA, and Norfolk., VA. The demonstration study examined inundation via these approaches: 1) reanalysis of impacts from 2011 Hurricane Irene, using numerical weather modeling in combination with coastal surge and hydrodynamic, urban inundation modeling to evaluate combined impact scenarios considering sea level rise, 2) remote sensing of flood extent from available optical and synthetic aperture radar useful for identifying storm impacts and as precursors for future response efforts, 3) adding value to remotely sensed flood maps through depth predictions and related efforts, and 4) examining coastal subsidence as measured through time-series analysis of synthetic aperture radar observations.

Long term monitoring and targeted observation combine with modeling and mapping to provide increased awareness of hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Disasters often follow hazards and the goal of NASA's Disasters Program is to look at the earth as a highly coupled system to reduce risk and enable resilience. Remote sensing and geospatial science are used as tools to help answer critical questions that inform decisions. Data is not the same as information, nor does understanding of processes necessarily translate into decision support for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. Accordingly, NASA is engaging the scientific and decision-support communities to apply remote sensing, modeling, and related applications in Communities and Areas at Intensive Risk (CAIR). In 2017, NASA's Applied Sciences Disasters Program hosted a regional workshop to explore these issues with particular focus on coastal Virginia and North Carolina. The workshop brought together partners in academia, emergency management, and scientists from NASA and partnering federal agencies to explore capabilities among the team that could improve understanding of the physical processes related to these hazards, their potential impact to changing communities, and to identify methodologies for supporting emergency response and risk mitigation. The resulting initiative, the mid-Atlantic CAIR project, demonstrates the ability to integrate satellite derived earth observations and physical models into actionable, trusted knowledge. Severe storms and associated storm surge, sea level rise, and land subsidence coupled with increasing populations and densely populated, aging critical infrastructure often leave coastal regions and their communities extremely vulnerable. The integration of observations and models allow for a comprehensive understanding of the compounding risk experienced in coastal regions and enables individuals in all positions make risk-informed decisions. This initiative uses a representative storm surge case as a baseline to produce flood inundation maps. These maps predict building level impacts at current day and for sea level rise (SLR) and subsidence scenarios of the future in order to inform critical decisions at both the tactical and strategic levels. To accomplish this analysis, the mid-Atlantic CAIR project brings together Federal research activities with academia to examine coastal hazards in multiple ways: 1) reanalysis of impacts from 2011 Hurricane Irene, using numerical weather modeling in combination with coastal surge and hydrodynamic, urban inundation modeling to evaluate combined impact scenarios considering SIR and subsidence, 2) remote sensing of flood extent from available optical imagery, 3) adding value to remotely sensed flood maps through depth predictions, and 4) examining coastal subsidence as measured through time-series analysis of synthetic aperture radar observations. Efforts and results are published via ArcGIS story maps to communicate neighborhoods and infrastructure most vulnerable to changing conditions. Story map features enable time-aware flood mapping using hydrodynamic models, photographic comparison of flooding following Hurricane Irene, as well as visualization of heightened risk in the future due to SIR and land subsidence.

We show that the antenna technologies generally used at lower frequencies are difficult to implement at terahertz frequencies. Additionally, one has to take a few extra steps and special care for designing antennas for space-based applications. In this paper, we review different design and implementation options for millimeter-wave and terahertz antennas for space applications. We detail how antenna design has to be a part of the overall system design for the success of the instruments for space missions. We also look into low-mass and low-profile conformal antenna technologies that will have a profound impact on future space instruments at terahertz frequencies.

The measurement of a single 340 GHz antenna showed that the return loss and gain are approximately 25 dB and 21 dBi, respectively. The measurement of two of the 2x2 560 GIIz array antenna showed that the return loss and directivity are 13 dB and 22 dB, respectively. All of the measured antennas had below -25 dB of the cross-polarization and symmetrical beam patterns. The silicon microfabrication technique allows fabrication of hundreds of horn antennas at once, allowing construction of multi-pixel heterodyne imagers and spectrometers at submillimeter wavelengths.

It takes advantage of a phase-locked loop single integrated circuit (IC) and harmonic generation with high speed CMOS gates. We use a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) IC to tune the final output with micro-Hertz resolution. An ultra-low-power micro controller that could serve as the clock controller is used to control the PLL and the DDS. All components are commercial off the shelf (COTS) with acceptable industrial support. The total power consumption is about 1.6 Watt with -45 dBm useful output at 40.507347996 GHz. The short-term instability introduced by the prototype is 7.3E-14 at 1s. The prototyped subsystem uses COTS demonstration boards for the sake of agile prototyping. There is still significant margin for improvement of the size and weight.

Particularly, this paper focuses on how we can interpret and record diverse and complex life events on behalf of humans, from a multi-perspective viewpoint. We propose a novel method named "fourth-person captioning", which generates natural language descriptions by summarizing visual contexts complementarily from three types of cameras corresponding the first-, second-, and third-person viewpoint. We first extend the latest image captioning technique and design a new model to generate a sequence of words given the multiple images. Then we provide an effective training strategy that needs only annotations supervising images from a single viewpoint in a general caption dataset and unsupervised triplet instances in the intelligent space. As the three types of cameras, we select a wearable camera on the human, a robot-mounted camera, and an embedded camera, which can be defined as the first-, second-, and third-person viewpoint, respectively. We hope our work will accelerate a cross-modal interaction bridging the human's egocentric cognition and multi-perspective intelligence.

Building on the superb cm observing conditions and existing infrastructure of the VLA site in the U.S. Southwest, the ngVLA is envisaged to be an interferometric array with more than 10 times the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the current VLA and ALMA, operating at frequencies spanning similar to 1.2 - 116 GHz with extended baselines reaching across North America. The ngVLA will be optimized for observations at wavelengths between the exquisite performance of ALMA at submm wavelengths, and the future SKA-1 at decimeter to meter wavelengths, thus lending itself to be highly complementary with these facilities. The ngVLA will be the only facility in the world that can tackle a broad range of outstanding scientific questions in modern astronomy by simultaneously delivering the capability to: (1) unveil the formation of Solar System analogues; (2) probe the initial conditions for planetary systems and life with astrochemistry; (3) characterize the assembly, structure, and evolution of galaxies from the first billion years to the present; (4) use pulsars in the Galactic center as fundamental tests of gravity; and (5) understand the formation and evolution of stellar and supermassive blackholes in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.

Planetary Bistatic Radar	SCIENCE WITH A NEXT-GENERATION VERY LARGE ARRAY	Monographs of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific		English	Article; Book Chapter							GALILEAN SATELLITES; LUNAR POLES; ARECIBO; JUPITER; ICE	Planetary radar observations offer the potential for probing the properties of characteristics of solid bodies throughout the inner solar system and at least as far as the orbit of Saturn. In addition to the direct scientific value, precise orbital determinations can be obtained from planetary radar observations, which are in turn valuable for mission planning or spacecraft navigation and planetary defense. The next-generation Very Large Array would not have to be equipped with a transmitter to be an important asset in the world's planetary radar infrastructure. Bistatic radar, in which one antenna transmits (e.g., Arecibo or Goldstone) and another receives, are used commonly today, with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) serving as a receiver. The improved sensitivity of the ngVLA relative to the GBT would improve the signal-to-noise ratios on many targets and increase the accessible volume specifically for asteroids. Goldstone-ngVLA bistatic observations would have the potential of rivaling the sensitivity of Arecibo, but with much wider sky access.	[Brozovic, M.; Naidu, Shantanu P.; Lazio, T.

It is increasingly evident that most PNe are descended from binary systems. PNe hence provide unique insight into a diverse range of astrophysical phenomena, including the influence of companion stars on the late stages of stellar evolution; stellar wind interactions and shocks; the physics and chemistry of photoionized plasmas and photon-dominated regions (PDRs); and enrichment of the ISM in the products of intermediate-mass stellar nucleosynthesis. We describe specific examples of the potential impact of the ngVLA in each of these areas.

These stars end their lives, evolving from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with extensive mass-loss into planetary nebulae with a spectacular array of morphologies. Binarity, and the associated formation of accretion disks (that drive collimated, fast jets) during the very late AGB or early post-AGB phase is believed to produce this dramatic morphological transformation. But the evidence for binarity and accretion during the AGB phase has been hard to obtain due to observational limitations. However, recent observations at UV and X-ray wavelengths have broken thru the observational barrier our studies using GALEX reveal a candidate population of AGB stars, generally with strongly-variable far-ultraviolet (FUV) emission (fuvAGB stars), and our follow-up studies with XMM-Newton, Chandra, and HST of a few key objects supports our hypothesis that these objects have companions that are actively accreting material from the primary. The most prominent fuvAGB star has been detected with the VLA, showing the presence of variable non-thermal emission. The ngVLA, with its unprecedented sensitivity, is needed to survey a statistical sample of fuvAGB stars over the 3-90 GHz range to search for and characterize the nature of the radio emission from fuvAGB stars and test our binarity+accretion hypothesis. Such a survey will distinguish between binarity/accretion-related radio emission that is expected to have both thermal and non-thermal components and display significantly time-variable on short time-scales (minutes to weeks), and single-star chromospheric emission from the primary that is expected to be thermal, possibly with time-variability, but only on long time-scales (many months to a year).

The population of these systems will create an ensemble gravitational-wave signal at nanohertz frequencies that is detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), such as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). By measuring nanohertz gravitational waves, we will be able to definitely demonstrate that supermassive black-hole binaries reach milliparsec separations, characterize their sub-parsec dynamical evolution, constrain scaling relationships between the bulge and central black-hole mass, and understand how gas inflow at large scales is fed to central galactic regions. The ngVLA will be an essential complement to this search; its goal resolution will allow for dual AGN to be distinguished, allowing for merger-rate estimates to constrain PTA searches. Using its intercontinental VLBI capabilities (i.e., the ngVLA Long Baseline Array), parsec-scale resolution of binary evolution may be possible, indicating whether binaries stall or are driven efficiently to sub-parsec separations. NANOGrav gravitational-wave analysis, in concert with observations by the ngVLA and complementary facilities, will paint a multi-messenger portrait of galaxy evolution and the dynamics of the most massive black-holes in the Universe.

By directly constraining the kinetic luminosity and total energy of the outflow, it offers the promise of greatly increasing our understanding of the effects of wind feedback on galaxy evolution. Detecting the SZE in these winds is very challenging, at the edge of what is possible using existing facilities. The scale of the signal (10-100 kpc) is, however, well matched to interferometers operating at mm wavelengths for objects at z similar to 1. Thus this could become a major science area for the ngVLA, especially if the design of the core is optimized for sensitivity on angular scales of > 1" in the 90 GHz band.

In this chapter, we outline the science case for the study of these supermassive pairs, and summarize discovery methods that can be used at radio wavelengths to discover them: including morphological, spectral, and time-domain identifications. One critical aspect of this work is that multi-messenger binary black hole studies may be possible with the ngVLA when combined with gravitational-wave searches using pulsar timing array techniques. However, long-baseline interferometry (i.e., 1000 km with the ngVLA Long Baseline Array) will make this possibility more likely by expanding the redshift range at which radio emission arising from two separate black holes may be resolved and studied.

The rarity of the bursts makes them challenging targets for dedicated observing, but their short duration and high brightness opens the possibility of detection via real-time, commensal searches.

We discuss the possibility of performing complementary weak lensing surveys at radio/microwave frequencies, using detections of CO-emitting galaxies with resolved continuum images from the ngVLA. This method has completely different systematic uncertainties to optical weak lensing shear measurements (e.g., in terms of blending, PSF, and redshift uncertainties), and can provide additional information to help disentangle intrinsic alignments from the cosmological shear signal. A combined analysis of optical and CO galaxy lensing surveys would therefore provide an extremely stringent validation of highly-sensitive future surveys with Euclid, LSST, and WFIRST, definitively rejecting biases due to residual systematic effects. A lensing survey on the ngVLA would also provide valuable spectral (kinematic) and polarimetric information, which can be used to develop novel cosmological analyses that are not currently possible in the optical.

The antenna is mainly made of metal so it could survive the harsh environment conditions (i.e. very low temperature and high radiation and ESD levels). The antenna is also flat to meet drastic volume constraints and has efficiencies higher than 80% at both the uplink and downlink X-band Deep Space frequency bands. This antenna is a key component for the potential mission enabling Direct Link to Earth (DTE) from and Direct-from-Earth (DFE) to the lander without any relay.

The modulation results in the (-1) indexed Floquet mode entering the visible region, thus becoming a leaky-wave (LW) mode with curvilinear phase-contour. In this paper, we explore the use of metallic MTSs to synthesize the reactance tensor required to obtain an objective radiation pattern, with a given shape and polarization. The proposed structure is particularly well suited to fabrication by metal additive manufacturing. We have designed several metallic MTS antennas, verifying their performance by full-wave simulations. We have also fabricated a prototype, and the measurements have validated the simulation results.

Extended autonomous rappelling calls for careful control of tether tension, precise management of tether spooling, and some measure of shock tolerance. This paper covers the design and testing of a first-generation tether management system (TMS) for Axel. The system uses a double bull-wheel capstan driven by a low-stiffness series elastic actuator (SEA) to provide tension control and decouple internal spooling tension from external tether tension. A series elastic actuator was chosen for this application to permit closed-loop tether tension control and to provide shock/drop tolerance of the rappelling system both while moving and when the system is inactive with the motors locked. Experiments on the new TMS show that this design performs well in keeping nearly constant spooling tension while rejecting large dynamic disturbances at the output. While the SEA is very effective at maintaining a given tension contribution, the additional effects of friction and the unique mechanical properties of the tether result in substantial errors in the measured output tension. Upcoming field trials will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and sufficiency of this system when integrated in Axel.

Especially, planetary rovers require such capability as a single collision may lead to the termination of a mission. For onboard computation, typical numeric approaches are unsuitable as they are computationally expensive and unstable on rocky terrain; instead, a light-weight analytic solution (ACE: Approximate Clearance Evaluation) is planning to be used for the Mars 2020 rover mission. ACE computes the state bounds of articulated suspension systems from terrain height bounds, and assess the safety by checking the constraint violation of states with the worst-case values. ACE's conservative safety check approach can sometimes lead to over-pessimism: feasible states are often reported as infeasible, thus resulting in frequent false positive detection. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient probabilistic variant of ACE (called p-ACE) which estimates the probability distributions of states in real time. The advantage of having probability distributions over states, instead of deterministic bounds, is to provide more flexible and less pessimistic worst-case evaluation with probabilistic safety guarantees. Empirically derived distribution models are used to compute the total probability of constraint satisfaction, which is then used for path assessment. Through experiments with a high-fidelity simulator, we empirically show that p-ACE relaxes the deterministic state bounds without losing safety guarantees.

As these robots aspire for high-speed autonomous flights in complex dynamic environments, robust scene understanding at long-range becomes critical. The problem is heavily characterized by either the limitations imposed by sensor capabilities for geometry-based methods, or the need for large-amounts of manually annotated training data required by data-driven methods. This motivates the need to build systems that have the capability to alleviate these problems by exploiting the complimentary strengths of both geometry and data-driven methods. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and propose a generic framework for adaptive scene segmentation using self-supervised online learning. We present this in the context of vision-based autonomous MAV flight, and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and realworld field tests.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous small rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated sorties for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy including emergency response to enable mission execution independently from human operators, and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. Experimental results of up to 11 hours of fully autonomous operation in indoor and outdoor environments illustrate the capability of our system.

Dynamic, delay and disruption tolerant communications and networking topologies at various Quality of Service levels are needed to meet future mission requirements, which may include multiple spacecraft flying in formation and coordinating among themselves. Additionally, secure proximity-and autonomous-communication among various types of space vehicles are needed to share rich, near real-time streams of information. Along with scalability and extensibility, cybersecurity is a crucial requirement for autonomous communications in space. taraCoAP is based on the terrestrial standard Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and along with its Cyber-Physical Autonomous Asset Observation and Management extension provides delay and disruption tolerant, autonomous communication among swarms or clusters of spacecraft to implement complex and time-varying networks to coordinate, collaborate and share rich streams of information. Efficient and mission-configurable, taraCoAP runs over the Bundle Protocol, utilizing an advanced Bundle Protocol Security Cipher Suite for secure, interoperable, cross-domain communications.

We have designed, fabricated and tested a broadband amplifier with more than 11 dB of gain from 38 GHz to at least 110 GHz, and a broadband amplifier with gain across all of F-band (90-140 GHz) with peak gain of 18.9 dB and noise figure of 7.4 dB at 120 GHz. In G-band we have developed an amplifier with 8.7 dB small-signal gain at 149 GHz, and when two such amplifiers were placed in series, large signal power measurements gave 18.2 dBm of output RF power and 10 dB gain at 147 GHz.

In 2012, we introduced the Moving Volume KinectFusion method that allows the volume/camera move freely in the space. In this work, we further develop the Moving Volume KinectFusion method (as rxKinFu) to fit better to robotic and perception applications, especially for locomotion and manipulation tasks. We describe methods to raycast point clouds from the volume using virtual cameras, and use the point clouds for heightmaps generation (e.g., useful for locomotion) or object dense point cloud extraction (e.g., useful for manipulation). Moreover, we present different methods for keeping the camera fixed with respect to the moving volume, fusing also IMU data and the camera heading/velocity estimation. Last, we integrate and show some demonstrations of rxKinFu on the mini-bipedal robot RPBP, our wheeled quadrupedal robot CENTAURO, and the newly developed full-size humanoid robot COMAN+. We release the code as an opensource package, using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) and the Point Cloud Library (PCL).

While these methods often offer theoretical guarantees on system performance, the number of time steps and samples needed to initially explore the environment before synthesizing a well-performing control policy is impractically large. This paper partially alleviates such a burden by incorporating a priori existing knowledge into learning, when such knowledge is available. Based on prior information about bounds on the differences between the transition probabilities at different states, we propose a learning approach where the transition probabilities at a given state are not only learned from outcomes of repeatedly performing a certain action at that state, but also from outcomes of performing actions at states that are known to have similar transition probabilities. Since the directly obtained information is more reliable at determining transition probabilities than second-hand information, i.e., information obtained from similar but potentially slightly different states, samples obtained indirectly are weighted with respect to the known bounds on the differences of transition probabilities. While the proposed strategy can naturally lead to errors in learned transition probabilities, we show that, by proper choice of the weights, such errors can be reduced, and the number of steps needed to form a near-optimal control policy in the Bayesian sense can be significantly decreased.

An active subspace method for accelerating convergence in Delaunay-based optimization via dimension reduction	2018 IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	57th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 17-19, 2018	Miami Beach, FL	IEEE, Mitsubishi Elect Res Labs, United Technologies Res Ctr, MathWorks, IEEE Control Syst Soc, Soc Ind & Appl Math, Inst Operat Res & Management Sci, Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engineers, European Control Assoc, Skydio, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Princeton Univ Press, Elsevier			GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION	Delaunay-based derivative-free optimization (Delta-DOGS) is an efficient and provably-convergent global optimization algorithm for problems with computationally-expensive function evaluations, including cases for which analytical expressions for the objective function may not be available. Delta-DOGS belongs to the family of response surface methods (RSMs), and suffers from the typical "curse of dimensionality", with the computational cost increasing quickly as the number of design parameters increases. As a result, the number of design parameters n in Delta-DOGS is typically limited to n less than or similar to 10. To improve performance for higher-dimensional problems, this paper proposes a combination of derivative-free optimization, seeking the global minimizer of a successively-refined surrogate model of the objective function, and an active subspace method, detecting and exploring preferentially the directions of most variability of the objective function. The contribution of other directions to the objective function is bounded by a small constant. This new algorithm iteratively applies Delta-DOGS to seek the minimizer on the d-dimensional active subspace that has most function variation. Inverse mapping is used to project data from the active subspace back to full-model for evaluating function values. This task is accomplished by solving a related inequality constrained problem. Test results indicate that the resulting strategy is highly effective on a handful of model optimization problems.

Similarly, high-data rate communications between a mother ship and a lander is highly desirable not only for navigation but for science data as well. THz communications systems present a number of advantages in implementing efficient data-links between various scenarios for space applications. This review article will discuss some of the recent advances in solid-state coherent sources that has now made it possible to design and implement THz communication systems specifically for space applications. An example architecture at 240 GHz has been suggested as it is now possible to achieve >100 mW of output power at 240 GHz. With highly sensitive and linear heterodyne mixers, such a system could potentially provide higher data rate capability than in use today.

Each vehicle is able to sense its neighborhood and adapt its motion accordingly without use of centralized reasoning or inter-vehicle communication. To enable a lightweight, low power solution, on-board stereo cameras are used for detection and tracking with depth images, while a downward-looking camera and an inertial measurement unit are used to estimate the position of the observer without use of GPS. We illustrate the robustness and accuracy of this approach through real-time, outdoor leader-follower experiments with three quadrotors. Our experiments show that state-of-art trackers are far less robust in detection against cluttered background. This demonstrates that stereo vision is a highly effective approach to perception for safe navigation of multiple MAVs in close proximity.

Typical hybrid propellants have been shown to survive over a wide range of temperatures, minimizing the need for thermal control. This ability to survive in low temperature environments, coupled with their high performance (comparable to liquid bipropellants) and ability to restart has made them viable candidates for a variety of missions. A technology development program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the last three years has focused on increasing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of hybrid rockets for a potential Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) and Interplanetary SmallSat applications. Results of this technology development will be presented.

CLOSED-LOOP POINTING OF THE REMOTE SENSING MAST OF THE MARS 2020 ROVER	GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION, AND CONTROL 2018, PTS I-II: ADVANCES IN THE ASTRONAUTICAL SCIENCES	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual American-Astronautical-Society Rocky Mountain Section Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference	FEB 01-07, 2018	AAS Rocky Mt Sect, Breckenridge, CO	Amer Astronaut Soc	AAS Rocky Mt Sect			The Mars 2020 project has baselined the addition of closed-loop pointing for the rover's Remote Sensing Mast (RSM). Pointing of the inherited remote sensing mast design (from the Mars Science Laboratory MSL Mission) is limited by backlash in the azimuth and elevation actuators and thermo-mechanical errors. The new onboard pointing system compensates for backlash by including a pointing guidance algorithm and for thermo-mechanical errors by including vision-based feedback. The new closed-loop pointing system aims to point a science instrument to better than 1 mrad when closing the loop around that science instrument imager, or to better than 2 mrad when closing the loop using the engineering navigation cameras. This paper describes the new closed loop pointing system architecture and the pointing algorithms.

Because of the deadzone present in all JPL-heritage thruster-based phase-plane control designs, the introduction of integral action into previous proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers has been problematic. (Of course, PID is simple to implement in the absence of a deadzone.) In this work, a stabilizer function is introduced which compares the (always stabilizing) PD control signal with the (sometimes desirable) PID control signal. In particular, when these two signals are in harmony (i.e., correlated in sign), the PID signal is utilized. On the other hand, when the PD and PID signals do not align (in sign), it can be shown that it is best to nullify the output of the controller. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate: (i) the stability of the algorithm and (ii) the minimum pulse-count and pointing error objectives.

The high-gain antenna was held on Earth-point until torques from atmospheric drag caused the spacecraft to lose line-of-sight lock with Earth. The Doppler data collected during the final plunge contains information about the spacecraft's acceleration due to atmospheric drag, and therefore, the density of Saturn's atmosphere. In this work, we present preliminary analysis of the end of mission Doppler data and its implications regarding the density of Saturn's upper atmosphere. A reconstruction of the spacecraft's final trajectory is discussed and used to fit a model of Saturn's atmosphere to the Doppler data taken during the final plunge. The Cassini navigation team's experience flying the spacecraft through the final five low altitude Saturn periapses is also discussed in the context of atmospheric drag and density models.

The end-of-mission target of September 15, 2017 was achieved by preserving propellant at the expense of minimizing maneuver cycles. A navigation strategy that incorporated orbit trim maneuvers was developed five years in advance to maintain position dispersions below 250 km (la) at three specific periapses, following the last targeted flyby in the mission. This paper reports on the actual maneuver performance and overall trajectory control to maintain the Grand Finale orbits, highlighting the differences between predicted and implemented values.

During this period, Cassini encountered its final eleven targeted flybys of Titan (T116-T126) and executed its last 62 orbits of Saturn. In these final months, the spacecraft's inclination was gradually raised from near equatorial to near 63 degrees, critical inclination, to prevent the line of apsides from rotating out of Titan's orbital plane. Critical inclination enables continued Titan flybys, the last of which places Cassini on an impact trajectory with Saturn, thereby satisfying planetary protection requirements. In this reporting period, the orbit period moved from 16 days to nearly 32 and, for the final 6 months, it was brought down to less than 7 days. By design, the spacecraft entered the Saturn atmosphere on its final orbit and vaporized on September 15, 2017. We also report on the particular challenges associated with a stellar occultation, a flyby of Saturn's rocks, and the last revolutions of the mission's Grand Finale.

Current spacecraft monitoring systems only target a subset of anomaly types and often require costly expert knowledge to develop and maintain due to challenges involving scale and complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), in overcoming these issues using expert-labeled telemetry anomaly data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity.

The increase in power handling capabilities is achieved by using an improved epitaxial structure together with an on-chip power combined topology that allows to combine several multiplying structures onto a single chip. The chip also exhibits a state-of-the-art conversion efficiency of 8-9% without any correction for the losses in fixtures/transitions used for the tests.

Radar measurements were carried out using a variety of targets at different range and velocities, such as freeway cars, clouds, rain and hillsides, to test the range and Doppler capabilities.

This work looks at the applicability of measuring wind speed and direction with mini ultrasonic anemometers on-board small unmanned aerial systems. The 'prop wash effect' from propeller air intake mixing of the wind is quantified through experiments for a multi-rotor platform in a low cost wind tunnel (LCWT). Trisonica and FT742SM sensors are compared through wind tunnel experiments for accuracy confirmation. The validation of measuring wind conditions on-board is compared with accepted estimation techniques for VTOL and fixed wing platforms.

In this paper we present a theory and system for runtime verification of a first-order past time linear temporal logic. The first-order nature of the logic allows a monitor to reason about events with data elements. While runtime verification of propositional temporal logic requires only a fixed amount of memory, the first-order variant has to deal with a number of data values potentially growing unbounded in the length of the execution trace. This requires special compactness considerations in order to allow checking very long executions. In previous work we presented an efficient use of BDDs for such first-order runtime verification, implemented in the tool DejaVu. We first summarize this previous work. Subsequently, we look at the new problem of dynamically identifying when data observed in the past are no longer needed, allowing to reclaim the data elements used to represent them. We also study the problem of adding relations over data values. Finally, we present parts of the implementation, including a new concept of user defined property macros.

Lunar Flashlight is an innovative NASA CubeSat mission dedicated to mapping water ice in the permanently-shadowed and occasionally-sunlit regions in the vicinity of the lunar South Pole. Lunar Flashlight will acquire these measurements from lunar orbit using a multi-band laser reflectometer composed of an optical receiver aligned with four lasers emitting different wavelengths in the shortwave infrared spectral region between 1 mu m and 2 mu m. The receiver measures the laser radiance reflected from the lunar surface in each spectral band and continuum/absorption reflectance band ratios are then analyzed to quantify water ice concentration in the illuminated spot. The receiver utilizes a 70x70-mm, aluminum, off-axis paraboloidal mirror with a focal length of 70 mm, which collects the incoming light onto a single, 2 mm diameter InGaAs detector with a cutoff wavelength of 2.4 mu m. We present the optical and mechanical designs of the receiver, including its optimization for rejection of solar stray-light from outside its intended field of view. This highly mass- and volume-constrained instrument payload will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first instruments onboard a Cube Sat performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit and the first planetary mission to use multi-band active reflectometry from orbit.

These disks are possibly threaded by Hall-effect generated large-scale horizontal magnetic fields. We have examined the dynamics of the corotation region of a low mass planet embedded in such a disk and the evolution of the associated migration torque. These disks lack strong turbulence and associated turbulent diffusion, and the presence of a magnetic field and radial gas flow presents a situation outside the applicability of previous corotation torque theory. We summarize the analytical analysis of the corotation torque, give details on the numerical methods used, and in particular the relative merits of different numerical schemes for the inviscid problem.

The noise of our Galactic-scale GW detector has been systematically evaluated by the Noise Budget and Interstellar Medium Mitigation working groups within the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) collaboration. Intrinsically, individual radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) used by NANOGrav can have some degree of achromatic red spin noise, as well as white noise due to pulse phase jitter. Along any given line-of-sight, the ionized interstellar medium contributes chromatic noise through dispersion measure (DM) variations, interstellar scintillation, and scattering. These effects contain both red and white components. In the future, with wideband receivers, the effects of frequency-dependent DM will become important. Having anticipated and measured these diverse sources of detector noise, the NANOGrav PTA remains well-poised to detect low-frequency GWs.

The miniaturization makes these systems inexpensive enough to allow scientists to contemplate placing several examples in low-Earth orbit concurrently, to observe atmospheric dynamics in clouds and storms. To identify the most important weather and climate problems that can be addressed with these new observations, and to develop corresponding observation strategies using these "distributed" systems, specific analyses were conducted and used to justify "distributed" measurement requirements and quantify their expected performance. This presentation will describe the types of convoys, the expected observations, and their applications.

GeoSTAR uses aperture synthesis to overcome the difficulty of attaining adequate spatial resolution from geostationary orbit. It is made possible with new technology that has now been developed and fully tested. Low-risk mission development can start as soon as funding becomes available. The sensor can be hosted on a commercial communications satellite, which could reduce the cost substantially Plans have been developed at JPL for such a mission, called "GeoStorm", focused on observing severe convective storms - tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective systems, and extratropical cyclones - with a goal of improving our understanding, modeling and prediction of these destructive phenomena. It can equally well be configured as an operational mission, where the goal is to collect data for immediate assimilation into regional forecast systems, provide "now-casting" as the storms unfold, and support post-disaster relief and recovery efforts. With key observables including vertical profiles of temperature, water vapor, wind and precipitation over a wide area, many focused applications are possible, particularly pertaining to aviation, transportation and marine operations, in both the civilian and defense domains.

The resolution is sufficient to measure absorption features of atmospheric constituents enabling retrieval of atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, surface emission and atmospheric constituents. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on Aqua launched in May of 2002 was the first hyperspectral grating-based infrared sounder designed for this purpose and is still operational today. AIRS has been followed by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on MetOp A and B, and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on Suomi NPP and JPSS. All instruments are operating well improving weather forecast and providing a wealth of information about the atmosphere. Additional CrIS and IASI instruments are expected to be launched providing data of this type into the late 2030's. AIRS, CrIS and IASI are all Low Earth Orbit (LEO) instruments with nominal spatial resolutions of 14km. Future IR sounders must achieve higher spatial and temporal resolution to match improvements in forecast models and be less costly to match anticipated future budget pressures. Higher temporal resolution can be achieved in several ways including operation in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) or in constellations of LEO satellites. Higher spatial resolution can be achieved using larger format focal plane assemblies in the instruments and larger aperture telescopes. Grating spectrometers are well suited to large format FPAs by allowing a wide field of view in a compact package. They also provide long life and are easy to operate. Concepts for next generation grating spectrometer IR sounders that have been developed over the years at JPL are presented along with technology advancements made to enable these concepts to achieve their stated goals.

Auto-Gopher-II - A wireline rotary-hammer ultrasonic drill that operates autonomously	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2018	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 05-08, 2018	Denver, CA	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc		Planetary sampling; piezoelectric devices; wireline drill; life detection	DRILLER/CORER	An important challenge of exploring the solar system is the ability to penetrate at great depths the subsurface of planetary bodies for sample collection. The requirements of the drilling system are minimal mass, volume and energy consumption. To address this challenge, a deep drill, called the Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Corp. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines breaking formations by hammering using a piezoelectric actuator and removing the cuttings by rotating a fluted bit. The hammering is produced by the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed by the JPL team as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to convert high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I. The lessons learned from these developments are being integrated into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings and sample management and drive electronics. In this paper the latest development will be reviewed including the piezoelectric actuator, cuttings removal and retention flutes and drive electronics.

There is a high demand for high-performance and low-cost uncooled infrared (IR) detectors. In order to meet this need we are investigating the use of MEMS piezoelectric resonator technology using aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films. Recent research has shown that piezoelectric resonators have the potential to be used as a core element for highly sensitive, low-noise, and low-power uncooled IR detectors. A novel design of an AlN IR sensor based on piezoelectric bending resonator is described and analyzed in this paper. The detector is constructed by using thermally mismatched materials which stress the resonator and shift the resonance frequency. The IR thermal input is sensed by monitoring the frequency shift induced by the in-plan thermal stress. These designs have the potential for very high sensitivity and are compatible with commercially viable CMOS fabrication technology.

In the past, many of the measurements were limited by what could be accomplished externally. A shift toward in-vivo monitoring for both diagnostic and therapeutic sensing and actuation [1] has created a need for low power electronics, high energy density batteries and methods to successfully power devices embedded in the body. For a review of the field and sensing capabilities see [2]. Recent studies suggest that charging with ultrasound is more efficient at longer transmission distance (> 10cm) than inductive charging [3]. In this manuscript, we discuss the modeling and experimentation that we have accomplished and demonstrate in ultrasonic charging of sensors having the form and fit of in-vivo sensors. The task goal has been to use piezoelectric transducers for wireless communication and powering of sensors internal to the human body with a goal to transmit power levels of 100 mu W a receiver with receiving area of 3x3 mm(2) over a distance of 16 cm equivalent to human body interior. The results suggest that we can transmit power levels that exceed this baseline requirement.

CubeSat Active Thermal Management in support of cooled electro-optical instrumentation for advanced atmospheric observing missions	CUBESATS AND NANOSATS FOR REMOTE SENSING II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on CubeSats and NanoSats for Remote Sensing II	AUG 21-22, 2018	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Active Thermal Control; Mechanically Pumped Fluid Loop; Micro-Pump; Cryocooler; Ricor K508N; Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing; SABER-Lite; CubeSat; SmallSat; Remote Sensing		The need for advanced cooled electro-optical instrumentation in remote observations of the atmosphere is well known and demonstrated by SABER on the TIMED mission. The relatively new use of small satellites in remote earth observing missions as, well as the challenges, are epitomized by the upcoming NOAA EON-IR 12U CubeSat missions. These advanced CubeSat missions, which hope to accomplish scientific objectives on the same scale as larger more traditional satellites, require advanced miniaturized cryocoolers and active methods for thermal management and power control. The active CryoCubeSat project (ACCS) is a demonstration of such a technology. Utilizing Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) techniques, a Mechanical Pumped Fluid Loop (MPFL), and miniature pumps and cryocoolers to create a closed loop fluid-based heat interchange system. The ACCS project creates a two-stage thermal control system targeting 6U CubeSat platforms. The first stage is composed of a miniature Ricor K508N cryocooler while the second is formed by a UAM fabricated heat exchanger MPFL system powered by a micro TCS M510 pump. The working fluid is exchanged between a built-in chassis heat exchanger and a deployable tracking radiator. This work details the theory design and testing of a relevant ground-based prototype and the analysis and modeling of the results as well as the development of a design tool to help in customized active thermal control designs for small satellites. Ultimately, the ACCS project hopes to enable a new generation of advanced CubeSat atmospheric observing missions.

Three of the EM1 cubesat missions, including the first deep space cubesat 'cluster', will be lunar orbiters with remote sensing instruments for lunar surface/regolith measurements. These include: Lunar Ice Cube, with its 1-4 micron broadband IR spectrometer, BIRCHES, to determine volatile distribution as a function of time of day; Lunar Flashlight, to confirm the presence of surface ice at the lunar poles, utilizing an active source (laser), and looking for absorption features in the returning signal; and LunaH-Map to characterize ice at or below the surface at the poles with a compact neutron spectrometer. In addition, the BIRCHES instrument on Lunar Ice Cube will provide the first demonstration of a microcryocooler (AIM/IRIS) in deep space. Although not originally required to do so, all will be delivering science data to the Planetary Data System, the first formal archiving effort for cubesats. 4 of the 20 recently NASA-sponsored (PSDS3) study groups for deep space cubesat/smallsat mission concepts were lunar mission concepts, most involving 12U cubesats.

CubeSat infrastructure imposes limits on propulsion systems, which are compounded by sensitivity to the spacecraft disposal state from the launch platform and potential launch delays. We propose circumventing launch platform complications by using waypoints in space to park a deep space SmallSat or CubeSat while awaiting the opportunity to enter a trajectory to flyby a suitable target. In our Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) project, we investigated scientific goals, waypoint options, potential concept of operations (ConOps) for periodic and new comets, spacecraft bus infrastructure requirements, launch platforms, and mission operations and phases. Our payload would include two low-risk instruments: a visible image (VisCAM) for 5-10 m resolution surface maps; and a highly versatile multispectral Comet CAMera (ComCAM) will measure 1) H2O, CO2, CO, and organics non-thermal fluorescence signatures in the 2-5 mu m MWIR, and 2) 7-10 and 8-14 mu m thermal (LWIR) emission. This payload would return unique data not obtainable from ground-based telescopes and complement data from Earth-orbiting observatories. Thus, the PrOVE mission would (1) acquire visible surface maps, (2) investigate chemical heterogeneity of a comet nucleus by quantifying volatile species abundance and changes with solar insolation, (3) map the spatial distribution of volatiles and determine any variations, and (4) determine the frequency and distribution of outbursts.

Current infrared spectra of the objects are inconclusive due to the lack of strong diagnostic features. Definitive compositional measurements of Phobos could be obtained using in-situ X-ray, gamma-ray, or neutron spectroscopy or collecting and returning samples to Earth for analysis. We have proposed, in lieu of those methods, to derive Phobos and Deimos compositional data from secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements by calibrating the instrument to elemental abundance measurements made for known samples in the laboratory. We describe the Phobos/Deimos Regolith Ion Sample Mission (PRISM) concept here. PRISM utilizes a high-resolution TOF plasma composition analyzer to make SIMS measurements by observing the sputtered species from various locations of the moons' surfaces. In general, the SIMS technique and ion mass spectrometers complement and expand quadrupole mass spectrometer measurements by collecting ions that have been energized to higher energies, 50-100 eV, and making measurements at very low densities and pressures. Furthermore, because the TOF technique accepts all masses all the time, it obtains continuous measurements and does not require stepping through masses. The instrument would draw less than 10 W and weigh less than 5 kg. The spacecraft, nominally a radiation-hardened 12U CubeSat, would use a low-thrust Solar Electric Propulsion system to send it on a two-year journey to Mars, where it would co-orbit with Deimos and then Phobos at distances as low as 27 km.

The receiver was designed in less than a year by JPL for Tyvak and GeoOptics for use in the GeoOptics CICERO constellation and leverages 25 years of JPL GNSS reciever design experience. Cion uses a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer along with existing space qualified RF down-converters, software, and firmware to produce atmospheric Radio Occultation (RO) data. By combining a FPGA with dual core ARM processor and an embedded system controller, the Xilinx Zynq processor is an enabling technology that provides a customizable digital signal processing platform integrated into the computer (System on a chip) and enables off-the-shelf hardware to become the main engine behind this software defined radio. Using Linux for the on-board computer allows for fast development times and liberal use of existing open source software libraries. The parts of the receiver that require real-time implementation are performed in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which can also be reprogrammed in flight. While the Zynq is not rad hard, the silicon on insulator (SOI) technology is rad tolerant 'by accident', allowing for its use in many space-based applications. Early results show that the Cion is working as designed, has demonstrated the first known GLONASS occultations, and obtains high quality atmospheric profiles with excellent lower troposphere penetration (near Earth's surface).

The Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System (AMMOS) Instrument Toolkit (AIT) is an open source toolkit developed in support of International Space Station and small satellite missions at NASA with the intention of providing critical capabilities for mission development and operations in a light-weight and easily configured suite of tools. AIT provides capabilities for commanding and sequencing, telemetry processing, scripting via a Python API, Deep Space Network SLE interfaces, and a web-based API and user interface for near real time operations monitoring. AIT aims for installation and configuration simplicity and keeps dependency requirements to a minimum, allowing for the toolkit to be installed and setup in only a few simple steps. Additionally, AIT is licensed under the permissive MIT license and available via public source control systems for ease of adoption and interagency collaboration.

This paper focuses on technology development during the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) project sponsored by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO), and coincident studies by the NOAA Office of Projects, Planning, and Analysis (OPPA). The CIRAS approach incorporates key new instrument technologies developed at JPL's Microdevices Lab (MDL) including a 2D array of High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) material, selected for its high uniformity, low cost, low noise and higher operating temperatures than traditional materials. The second key technology is an MWIR Grating Spectrometer (MGS) designed by Ball Aerospace with a JPL MDL slit and immersion grating to provide hyperspectral infrared imaging in a CubeSat volume. The third key technology is a blackbody calibration target fabricated with MDL's black silicon to have very high emissivity in a flat plate construction. JPL has completed design and breadboard of the mechanical, electronic and thermal subsystems for CIRAS payload including a HOT-BIRD FPA, with filters in a dewar and a breadboard of the electronics and scan mirror assembly. Blue Canyon Technologies, developer of the CIRAS 6U CubeSat, completed the Final Design Review for the spacecraft.

Constellations of CubeSats to exploit Signals-of-Opportunity for Earth System Science	CUBESATS AND NANOSATS FOR REMOTE SENSING II	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on CubeSats and NanoSats for Remote Sensing II	AUG 21-22, 2018	San Diego, CA	SPIE		CubeSat constellations; microwave remote sensing; signals of opportunity; bistatic radar; Earth Science	L-BAND; ALTIMETRY; OCEAN; RFI; INTERFEROMETRY; GEOSTATIONARY	Signals-of-Opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry is a concept for reutilizing existing microwave satellite transmissions, in bands allocated for space-to-Earth communications and navigation, for the purpose of Earth remote sensing. SoOp uses a bistatic radar geometry employing forward scatter, which views Earth differently from traditional monostatic (backscatter) radars and radiometers. Additionally, SoOp enables use of microwave frequencies outside the limited number of narrow and protected bands allocated for remote sensing. A powerful example of the science returns achievable using SoOp is currently being demonstrated on orbit by the NASA's Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission, which measures ocean surface wind speed using reflected Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Over the past decade we have seen a growing number of communication and navigation signals coming into existence spanning the range of frequencies from Very High Frequency (VHF) to K Bands, which could be used to measure different variables using wavelengths optimally suited to specific interactions with the Earth system, including: Soil Moisture; Sea Surface Height; Ocean Vector Winds; Snow Water Equivalent; Root Zone Soil Moisture; and Vegetation Water Content. The use of SoOp for earth remote sensing could enable these measurements from small passive receivers in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) on CubeSat constellations to improve the temporal frequency of the observations. This paper describes different architectures of CubeSats constellations that could be used to measure different science measurements as well as identifying some of the challenges of the SoOp technique.

Existing and planned concepts for finding near-Earth objects (NEOs) with diameter of 140 m or larger would take similar to 15-20 years of observation to find similar to 90% of them. This includes both ground and space based projects. For smaller NEOs (similar to 50-70 m in diameter), the time scale is many decades. The reason it takes so long to detect these objects is because most of the NEOs have highly elliptical orbits that bring them into the inner solar system once per orbit. If these objects cross the Earth's orbit when the Earth is on the other side of the Sun, they will not be detected by facilities on or around the Erath. A constellation of MicroSats in orbit around the Sun can dramatically reduce the time needed to find 90% of NEOs similar to 100-140 m in diameter.

Design of a simple, lightweight optical transceiver with full duplex capability, fast-tracking speed and 360 degrees field of regard for CubeSat is crucial due to extreme SWaP-C limitations. In this paper, we describe the design tradeoff between the field of view and collection efficiency in receiver design using Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) optics and detectors. We also briefly discussed the design tradeoffs in transmitter design for optimum performance. We show that to achieve maximum SNR at long distance(>= 100km), the laser beam diameter needs to be 80%-90% of the scanning mirror diameter. In addition to that, we show that the intrinsic Field of View (FOV) of high speed(>= 600MHz) Avalanche Photodiodes (APD) can be increased to >= 3 degrees by incorporating optimized optics considering form factor of the CubeSat system. In addition, we present a scalable detector array design method using COTS components to achieve a wide full FOV(>= 12 degrees) with a uniform collection efficiency around 30%-60%. Furthermore, we demonstrated a multi-wavelength full duplex communication system based on dichroic filters as duplexer that shows significantly low crosstalk. The system also exhibits low transmission power loss(<= 4%) as opposed to around 40% that of the conventional beam splitter based system.

Its two sensors, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), are continuing to produce high quality data. The OLI has been radiometrically stable at the better than 0.3% level on a band average basis for all but the shortest wavelength (443 nm) band, which has degraded about 1.3% since launch. All on-board calibration devices continue to perform well and consistently. No gaps in across track coverage exist as 100% operability of the detectors is maintained. The variability over time of detector responsivity within a band relative to the average is better than 0.05% (1 sigma), though there are occasional detectors that jump up to 1.5% in response in the Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) bands. Signal-to-Noise performance continues at 2-3x better than requirements, with a small degradation in the 443 nm band commensurate with the loss in sensitivity. Pre-launch error analysis, combined with the stability of the OLI indicates that the absolute reflectance calibration uncertainty is better than 3%; comparisons to ground measurements and comparisons to other sensors are consistent with this. The Landsat-8 TIRS is similarly radiometrically stable, showing changes of at most 0.3% over the mission. The uncertainty in the absolute calibration as well as the detector to detector variability are largely driven by the stray light response of TIRS. The current processing corrects most of the stray light effects, resulting in absolute uncertainties of similar to 1% and reduced striping. Efforts continue to further reduce the striping. Noise equivalent delta temperature is about 50 mK at typical temperatures and 100% detector operability is maintained. Landsat-9 is currently under development with a launch no earlier than December 2020. The nearly identical OLI-2 and upgraded TIRS-2 sensors have completed integration and are in the process of instrument level performance characterization including spectral, spatial, radiometric and geometric testing. Component and assembly level measurements of the OLI-2, which include spectral response, radiometric response and stray light indicate comparable performance to OLI. The first functional tests occurred in July 2018 and spatial performance testing in vacuum is scheduled for August 2018. Similarly, for TIRS-2, partially integrated instrument level testing indicated spectral and spatial responses comparable to TIRS, with stray light reduced by approximately an order of magnitude from TIRS.

Updates to the Absolute Radiometric Accuracy of the AIRS on Aqua	EARTH OBSERVING MISSIONS AND SENSORS: DEVELOPMENT, IMPLEMENTATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Missions and Sensors: Development, Implementation, and Characterization V	SEP 25-26, 2018	Honolulu, HI	SPIE, Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Minist Earth Sci		AIRS; hyperspectral infrared; absolute; radiometric; calibration		The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft was launched on May 4, 2002. The AIRS was designed to measure atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles and has demonstrated exceptional radiometric and spectral accuracy and stability in-orbit. The accuracy is achieved by transferring the calibration from a Large Area Blackbody (LABB) to the On-Board Calibrator (OBC) blackbody during preflight testing and frequent on-board calibration. The LABB theoretical emissivity is in excess of 0.9999 and temperature uncertainty is less than +/- 60 mK. The LABB emitted radiance is NIST traceable through thermistors located on the internal surfaces. The AIRS also provides a full aperture space view every scan for offset calibration. AIRS nonlinearity and polarization calibration coefficients were based on pre-flight testing and have been among the highest uncertainty sources in the calibration. A recent method using on-board space view data has reduced the uncertainty of the polarization coefficients and use of separate A side and B side data from pre-flight testing has reduced the uncertainty of the nonlinearity estimates. An update to the system radiometric uncertainty is made based on the new data and includes other refinements and is presented in this paper. This paper does not address the stability of the AIRS radiances in orbit that is usually determined by comparison with surface observations.

We evaluated the stability of the AIRS Level 1B version 5 calibration for seven atmospheric window channels between 2002 and 2018 under clear ocean clear conditions. We do this by analyzing the trend in the difference between the observed brightness temperatures and those calculated based on the daily Sea Surface Temperature product provided by NOAA. Trends for the- 961, 1128 and 1231 cm(-1) channels are close to +3 mK/yr, at 790 and 901 cm(-1) thetrends are 6 mK/yr. For all observation the AIRS window channels read increasingly warmer. The observed trends are day/night consistent and insensitive to changes in the clear filter. The effects of scattering due to scan mirror contamination are evident at 2508 and 2616 cm(-1) for extremely cold scenes surrounded by warm scenes, but scattering does not produces the observed warming trends for warm scenes. It is possible that much of the observed warming in the AIRS window channels is due to a shift in the day/night and skin effect corrections, which was not accounted for in our analysis. This would be a new geophysical effect related to the warming of the oceans, which requires more careful evaluation.

Stratified radiometric means for the evaluation of AIRS and CrIS	EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIII	AUG 21-23, 2018	San Diego, CA	SPIE		AIRS; CrIS; CrIMSS; hyperspectral sounding		There are now five hyperspectral infrared sounders in orbit (AIRS, two CrIS instruments, two IASI instruments). A long-term record spanning these instruments and continuing forward with future instruments holds great promise for the study of weather and climate. This long-term record must separate the effects of instrument artifacts and weather variability. We introduce the "StratRad" stratified radiance means product, containing means of groups of spectra for AIRS on Aqua and CrIS on SNPP. We show how this product can be used both to illuminate instrument artifacts and to study common observations of weather patterns at an accuracy of better than 0.1 K. Radiances are stratified by latitude, longitude, day/night, land/sea, and observation angle.

The calibration equations are based on how the instrument operates and follow a simple second order relationship between counts and radiance. Terms are included to account for nonlinearity of the detectors, emissivity and temperature knowledge of the on-board calibrator (OBC) blackbody and radiometric offset due to coupling of the polarization of the scan mirror with the spectrometer. In this paper, we re-derive the radiometric calibration equation with a little more rigor and account for the view angle of each of the 4 space views. We then derive new polarization coefficients from the 4 space views over the mission and use them re-derive the coefficients for blackbody emissivity and nonlinearity. We then compare new coefficients (Version 7k) with the latest operational version of the AIRS radiometric calibration coefficients (Version 5). The AIRS Version 5 coefficients were sufficiently adequate that an update has never been made since AIRS launch in 2002. However, it can be seen, when we compare to the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), that better agreement is made in Version 7. The impact of the new coefficients is highest at cold scene temperatures and very warm temperatures.

BISTATIC SCATTERING MODELING FOR DYNAMIC MAPPING OF TROPICAL WETLANDS WITH CYGNSS	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy				The objective of this paper is to model and study the sensitivity of bistatic microwave scattering versus changes in wetland characteristics as observed by a GNSS-R satellite system such as CYGNSS. We develop a simplified scattering model starting from the Water Cloud Model traditionally used in monostatic radar problems. Vegetation is idealized as a cloud of randomly oriented scattering elements over a rough surface representing either soil or water. The bistatic scattering coefficient is modeled as the incoherent sum of soil, water and vegetation scattering weighted by the fraction of each contribution within the CYGNSS footprint. The model is tested against CYGNSS observations across the Everglades National Park for which high-resolution landcover and water depth maps are available. We show that our simplified model is able to capture to first order the variability of bistatic scattering versus changes in water depth and water fraction. This effort is a step forward towards the development of an effective algorithm to map the dynamic state of tropical wetlands and other regions subject to flooding using CYGNSS measurements.

MODELING L-BAND SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR OBSERVATIONS THROUGH DIELECTRIC CHANGES IN SOIL MOISTURE AND VEGETATION OVER SHRUBLANDS	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy		L-band; soil moisture; SAR		L-band airborne synthetic aperture radar observations were made over California shrublands to better understand the effects of soil and vegetation parameters on backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) for the period of 2011 to 2015. HH was always greater than VV, suggesting the importance of double-bounce scattering by the woody parts. However, the geometric and dielectric properties of the woody parts did not vary significantly over time. Instead the changes in vegetation water content (VWC) were observed to occur primarily in thin leaves that may not meaningfully influence absorption and scattering. Accordingly, unlike in the past literature, the VWC input of the plant to the model was formulated as a function of plant's dielectric property (water fraction) while the plant geometry remains static in time. A physically-based model for single scattering by discrete elements of plants successfully simulated the magnitude of the temporal variations in HH, VV, and HH/VV with a difference of less than 0.9 dB. The modeling results offer an explanation of why soil moisture correlated highly with sigma(0), which is that the dominant mechanisms for HH and VV are double-bounce scattering by trunk, and soil surface scattering, respectively.

PHYSICS-BASED MODELING OF ACTIVE-PASSIVE MICROWAVE COVARIATIONS FOR GEOPHYSICAL RETRIEVALS	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy		active-passive microwave sensing; microwave covariation; multi-frequency; SMAP; Sentinel-1		Combined active-passive remote sensing has the potential for capturing the relative advantage of each sensing approach in geophysical retrievals. One cornerstone of combined active-passive microwave sensing is the modeling of the covariation of active and passive signals, which arise from equivalent sensitivities of both sensor types to changes in geophysical properties. In this research contribution, we propose a physics-based active-passive combination of active and passive microwave observations based on Kirchhoff's law of energy conservation. This allows establishing a physics-based forward model as well as a fully data-driven, single-pass retrieval methodology for active-passive microwave covariation. The forward model and the retrieval approach are adaptable to different sensor characteristics (incidence angle, frequency & polarization). The theoretical (forward model) as well as applied (retrieval method) physics-based covariation framework is tested with SMAP (LL) and SMAP/Sentinel-1 (LC) data to reveal potentials and constraints for active-passive microwave sensing. As a result of the conducted study, a linear functional relationship between active and passive microwave observations (e.g. assumed for the SMAP mission) is confirmed, if higher-order scattering can be omitted.

The hybrid method of solving the Maxwell equations consist of off-the-shelf technique for single objects (e. g. HFSS) and newly developed techniques. The newly developed techniques are the three key steps of the hybrid method: (1) extracting the T matrix of each single object, (2) numerical wave transformations and (3) solving the coupled wave interaction equations (i.e. FL) for all the objects. For step (1), we extract the T matrix of a single object by numerical integration with the use of HFSS which is a 3D full-wave electromagnetic field simulation tool. The method of T matrix extraction from HFSS is verified by comparison with the analytical solution of a sphere. The method is applicable to find the T matrix for complicated object where the analytical solution is not available. Then, the wave transformations are performed based on the translation addition theorem. Numerical methods of calculating the transformation coefficients are developed. Finally, the wave interactions among the single objects are accounted for by FL. The results of the hybrid method agree with those of the HFSS brute force method. In comparison, the hybrid method is much more efficient than HFSS for vegetation scattering and applicable to large problems such as full wave simulations of a tree.

While replacement of the existing observing strategies with those based on smallsats is not indicated, they do offer the promise of completely new observing strategies that can measure characteristics of natural phenomena and physical processes that were not possible with the monolithic Battlestar Galactica type systems. Distributed Spacecraft Missions (DSM) are starting to take shape, as described in this Session. Variations in configurations are possible including geometry and composition and the degree of autonomy in operations. A number of sensor web information technologies have been matured, but mostly focused on ground based systems. Some useful technologies have also matured in other domains, such as machine learning and the Internet of Things. New technology development is needed, guided by a framework to prioritize new investments. Such a framework would also encourage division of labor and collaboration among Governments, companies and educational institutions.

Each satellite carries a four channel bistatic radar receiver which measures GPS signals scattered from the Earth surface, from which ocean surface wind speed is determined. The use of a constellation, and the way their orbits are configured relative to one another, enable critical sampling properties.

There are a multitude of challenges for accurate stereo imaging of clouds and aerosols including the high variation of radiative properties of aerosols and clouds within an image. In this work, we adapt an image model to separate two specific types of clouds frequently appearing in MISR images. Specifically, we separate cirrus and cumulus clouds in the two-dimensional MISR single-channel images. We characterize these two cloud types according to their spatial variations and optical brightness. Cirrus clouds appear smooth and optically thin, while cumulus clouds present high optical oscillations and appear brighter. We adapt the additive piecewise-smooth (APS) model for this cloud separation task.

We present an algorithm that utilizes conventionally defined scattering (S) parameters to represent the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation through the vegetation layer over soil. The S-parameters can be determined with full wave simulations of 3-D Maxwell Equations enabled by recent advances in numerical simulation techniques. Traditional retrieval algorithms have relied on approximation of the radiative transfer equation in order to find simple parameterization for the equation. This results in added uncertainty when the attenuation and scattering within the vegetation layer increases. The presented method provides a way to model the radiative transfer accurately while preserving a reasonable complexity and number of parameters in the algorithm. The results show that the presented method improves the brightness temperature modelling accuracy significantly when vegetation water content reaches about 5 kg/m2, depending on the scattering properties of the vegetation type.

Among them are Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA's) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE) launched on NASA's Aqua satellite, European Space Agency's (ESA's) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, JAXA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W satellite, and NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Based on the availability of these four missions, there is an opportunity to develop a consistent inter-calibrated long-term soil moisture data record. This study focuses on the parametrization of the tau-omega model for soil moisture retrieval at L-, C-and X-band using brightness temperature observations from the four missions and in-situ soil moisture and soil temperature data from the SMAP core validation sites across various land cover types. The ancillary data sets used in the SMAP baseline algorithm are used for the retrievals at different frequencies. Simultaneous calibrations of the vegetation parameter b and roughness parameter h at both horizontal and vertical polarizations are performed. A set of model parameters to successfully retrieve soil moisture at different validation sites at L-, C-and X-band are presented. A preliminary comparison of SMAP and AMSR2 soil moisture retrievals against in situ observations at the Yanco (Australia) and TxSON (U. S.) sites showed the best accuracy and correlation at L-band (RMSD= 0.03-0.05 m3/m3; R= 0.92-0.94). The C-/X-band performance was not as satisfactory as L-band (RMSD= 0.08-0.17 m3/m3; R= 0.240.79). This also indicates that retrieval at higher frequencies can be very challenging when dense vegetation is present.

In contrast, we describe radar data of a vegetated scene as a linear function of soil moisture. This eliminates the dependence on ancillary data while providing reasonable global soil moisture estimates. We derive two polarization dependent coefficients of a linear model on the basis of spatial and temporal similarity at a global scale from nearly 4 years of L-band Aquarius radar and radiometer derived soil moisture data. These global coefficients are then used to derive soil moisture from 2.5 months of L-band SMAP radar data. The resulting soil moisture estimates are evaluated with the SMAP Level 2 radiometer-only soil moisture product.

Global observations using the TWICE instrument are critically needed to reduce uncertainties in weather and climate models. A low-noise, power-efficient command and data handling (C&DH) subsystem has been designed and tested to control TWICE data acquisition and other subsystems. Considering the limited power resources available on such platforms, a highly-efficient power regulation board has been designed to minimize power losses and reduce system noise. Furthermore, heavy-ion radiation testing has been performed for some critical commercial-off-the-shelf components to analyze radiation tolerance in low-Earth orbit. The C&DH prototype board meets the functional, noise and size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements for deployment on a 6U-Class satellite.

The direct-detection architecture of the radiometer reduces its power consumption and eliminates the need for a local oscillator and mixer, reducing complexity. The instrument includes an ambient blackbody calibration target and a scanning reflector. The reflector rotates to scan the antenna beams in the cross-track direction so that the TEMPEST-D feed horn and receiver view first the blackbody calibration target, then the Earth over a range of nadir angles from -45 degrees to + 45 degrees, and finally the cosmic microwave background radiation at 2.73 K. This enables precision end-to-end calibration of the millimeter-wave receivers every scan period. The TEMPEST-D millimeter-wave radiometers are based on 35-nm InP HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifiers and related technology developed under extensive investment by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO).

It is designed to measure the soil moisture over land using a combined active / passive L-band system. Due to the Aquarius mission, L-band model functions for ocean winds and salinity are already mature and may be directly applied to the SMAP mission. In contrast to Aquarius, the higher resolution and scanning geometry of SMAP allows for wide-swath ocean winds and salinities to be retrieved. We have found that the SMAP radiometer displays sensitivity all the way up to the most extreme wind speeds, possibly as high as 70 m/s, far beyond what is capable with typical C and Ku-band ocean wind scatterometers. In previous work we have validated the SMAP high wind speeds against Rapid Scatterometer (RapidScat) and Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). In this work we consider the size of the SMAP cyclones and compare them to the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) system B-deck files and we update the SFMR analysis with an additional year of data to strengthen the previous conclusions.

This study investigated the influence of the orientation angle of a building on double bounce effect from the floodwater surface. We suggest the potential key component of urban flood detection considering the characterization of the double bounce effect from land surface backscatters in the selected experimental area, which covers the hardest flood-hit municipalities during the 2015 Kinu River flood in Japan. To improve the urban flood detection ability, the correlation coefficient of the intensity derived from the building orientation was then applied to detect the flooded buildings.

The Brightness Temperature (TB) measurement by the SMAP L-band radiometer over ocean is also used for Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) retrieval. Considering the requirement of the uncertainty in the L-band TB measurement for SSS retrieval, the reflected galaxy correction is to be upgraded by using wind speed dependent galactic TB maps (the cosmic microwave background is included) for the radiometer TB data product (version 4) which is expected to be released in the summer 2018. We address the development of the galactic TB maps. In addition, a correction offset to the modeled ocean radiometric observation for horizontal polarization is described.

In this study, the most recent and latest microwave remote sensing soil moisture products were evaluated against ground-based measurements. We compared, for the first time, the latest versions of SMOS (L2V650 and SMOS-IC V105), SMAP (L3V4), and CCI (V03.2) soil moisture products with respect to ground-based measurements obtained from ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network). Time series were plotted over some sites and it was found that all these products capture well the temporal dynamics over all the sites used in this study. However, CCI was wetter than the in situ measurements over Niger and both SMOS products (IC and L2) and SMAP were drier than the in situ observations over Biebrza site in Poland.

The global L-band radiometry from SMAP has enabled diverse scientific investigations in water, energy and carbon cycle research, terrestrial ecology and ocean science. These include eliciting the role of soil moisture control on the evaporation regime and vegetation gross primary productivity, observing soil-vegetation continuum water relations, analysis of flood and droughts, climate modeling and weather prediction, detecting ocean high-winds during tropical storms, and observing fresh-water outflow in coastal oceans.

Instrument behavior is stable over 33 months of operation to date. The physical temperature of the internal calibration sources varies 0.5oC. The bias current of the noise source drifted by less than 0.1%. The avalanche breakdown voltage of the noise diode shows 0.01% seasonal variation. The average NEDT of the radiometer has maintained a stable 1-K value over the period. This stable behavior of the hardware is critical for the consistent calibration. The reflector emissivity was re-estimated using on-orbit data. Use of the new value nearly eliminates bias caused by solar eclipse during the southern hemisphere winter. The radiometer data were recalibrated using, as earlier, global ocean and cold sky views with additional ocean and land views at nadir incidence. The Version 4 recalibrated data exhibit 0.1-K RMS stability over average global ocean and monthly cold-sky views.

In regions near the coast or near inland bodies of water, the SMAP footprint contains land and water, resulting in errors in the soil moisture estimation. In this paper, we address the effort to extract the brightness temperature related to the land fraction or water fraction (depending on the center of the footprint location) from the affected SMAP measurements. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm over simulated data. We then show results over real data. The new SMAP upgraded product is expected to be delivered on April 2018.

The SMAP freeze/thaw algorithm is based on a seasonal threshold approach. It's important to have a stable and self-consistent freeze and thaw reference that can be applied for multi-year dataset. The three-year long radiometer datasets allow us to reassess the criteria of reference setup and evaluate its stability. In this paper, we first refined the freeze reference requirements and compare three different methods of setting up the thaw reference to minimize the false flags. The original freeze/thaw products is in the polar grid and only cover the region north of 45 degrees N latitude. The limitation is due to lack of enough freezing days in the lower latitude, where the freezing reference cannot be generated. To extend the freeze/thaw product to global region, we combine the single channel algorithm in the lower latitude and southern atmosphere. The global results have been validated through WMO air temperature.	[Xu, Xiaolan; Dunbar, R.

This product is obtained by combining the SMAP radiometer data and the Sentinel-1A and -1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The approach used for this product draws heavily from the heritage SMAP active-passive algorithm. Modifications in the SMAP activepassive algorithm are done to accommodate the Copernicus Program's Sentinel-1A and -1B multi-angular C-band SAR data. Assessment of the SMAP and Sentinel active-passive algorithm has been conducted and results show feasibility of estimating surface soil moisture at highresolution in regions with low vegetation density (< 3 kg m-2). The beta version of this product is released to public on Nov 1st, 2017. This high resolution (3 km) soil moisture product is useful for agriculture, flood mapping, watershed/ rangeland management, and ecological/ hydrological applications.

For modeling simplicity, model parameters such as the single scattering albedo (.) and vegetation opacity (t) that go into the geophysical inversion process are often assumed to be independent of polarizations. Although this absence of polarization dependence can often be justified in special cases as in low-frequency remote sensing or under dense vegetation conditions, it is not a robust assumption in general. Additional model parameterization errors arising from this assumption are possible, leading to degradation in soil moisture estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a time series approach to try to resolve the polarization dependence of several t-. model parameters as well as the temperature bias arising from the ancillary temperature data. The Version 4 of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 1B brightness temperature time series observations were used to illustrate the mechanics of this approach, with an emphasis on the comparison between resulting satellite retrieval and in situ data collected at several core validation sites. It was found that this time series approach resulted in significant reduction of dry bias exhibited in the current SMAP passive soil moisture data products, while retaining the same performance in other metrics of the current baseline passive soil moisture retrieval algorithm.

SMAP brightness temperature observations were compared with SMOS observations at 40o incidence angle. The brightness temperatures from the two missions are not consistent. SMAP observations show a warmer TB bias (about 1.27 K: V pol and 0.62 K: H pol) as compared to SMOS. SMAP and SMOS missions use different retrieval algorithms and ancillary datasets which result in further inconsistencies between their soil moisture products. The reprocessed constant-angle SMOS brightness temperatures were used in the SMAP soil moisture retrieval algorithm to develop a consistent multi-satellite product. The integrated product has an increased global revisit frequency (1 day) and period of record that is unattainable by either one of the satellites alone. Results from the development and validation of the integrated soil moisture product will be presented.

To address this, we present passive radio sounding as a low resource approach for observing the subsurface of ice sheets and glaciers. Although passive radar has been used for target tracking and military purposes, it has never been implemented for ice sounding. Nevertheless, recent work has proposed the passive radio sounding of Europa's icy shell using Jupiter's decametric radiation as a source for echo detection [1,2]. Expanding on this idea, we evaluate and discuss the challenges of developing a passive radio sounder that uses the Sun for echo detection. Our prototype measures the Sun's direct and reflected path off the ocean to obtain the height of a cliff along the California coast. This serves as the first in-situ demonstration of an autocorrelation-based passive-sounder using a compact astronomical white noise source.

NOISE CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS ON PASSIVE RADIO SOUNDING OF JUPITER'S ICY MOONS USING JOVIAN DECAMETRIC RADIATION	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy		Passive Sounding; Radar Sounder; JUNO Waves; Jupiter Icy Moons		Jupiter is one of the Solar System's most powerful source of radio waves in the MHz range. Very recent studies proposed that Jovian Decametric Radiation can be effectively exploited for probing the subsurface of Jupiter's icy moons Europa and Ganymede by using passive radio sounding. However, these studies results were based on the assumption that the Jovian noise is white and stationary. Therefore additional investigation into the temporal stability, predictability, and spectral properties of Jovian noise are required to fully assess the potential of passive radar sounding. In this paper, we investigate the actual spectral structure, temporal occurrence and general characteristics of the Jovian Decametric Radiation for understanding their impact on the radar sounding performance metrics. This is done by analyzing the recently available Jupiter's radio spectra acquired by JUNO Waves. The results show that the Jovian Decametric Radiation (i) is not perfectly white and some performance deterioration in the range response should be expected and (ii) has a varying temporal occurrence versus probing frequency.

The measurements from CYGNSS allow for the first time a large, densely sampled, and calibrated GNSS-R dataset to be used for ocean surface altimetry. Re-tracking of the reflected signal correlation waveform is one of the most significant performance limiting components of ocean altimetry retrievals. This work demonstrates the use of empirical methods and physical scattering delay/delay-Doppler waveform models, fit to the measured correlation functions in a least-squares sense, to retrieve the specular reflection delay. We examine the performance of waveform modelling methods as compared to single-point re-tracking methods for the first time with a spaceborne dataset. Particular attention is given to the presence of narrow waveforms in the data set, indicative of coherent, rather than purely diffuse reflection. Re-tracking performance is quantified with statistics of the accuracy and precision and examples are presented for returns demonstrating both diffuse and coherent characteristics.

THE INSAR SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT 3.0: A FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR NISAR OPERATIONAL AND USER-LED SCIENCE PROCESSING	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy		InSAR processing; geodetic imaging; computational frameworks; Earth science informatics		The InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) was first developed under the NASA Advanced Information Systems Technology as a flexible, extensible object-oriented framework for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. The ISCE framework uses Python 3 at the workflow level, controlling modules of compiled code for functional processing, and managing inputs, outputs, and other flow control services. The currently released version, called ISCE 2.1, is distributed to the research community through the Western North America InSAR Consortium under a research license. The ISCE team is working on the next generation of the code in order to prepare for the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission operational processing. Innovations in this code include augmentation or conversion of the custom Python framework elements in ISCE with the Pyre framework, new workflows for interferometric and polarimetric stack processing, a more intuitive and graphically based user interface, and flow control for hybrid computing environments including CPU/GPU clusters, logging and error tracking facilities, and new more efficient computational modules that exploit graphical processor units (GPUs) when available. The ISCE 3.0 framework is designed to work in an operational environment as well as on a single user's laptop or compute cluster, with services to discover capabilities and scale computations accordingly.

In the Arctic Ocean, SSS responses to river discharge, sea ice melting/freezing and drifting, surface freshwater forcing (precipitation and evaporation), and ocean transport through open straits from/to Pacific and Atlantic oceans. However, in situ SSS data in the Arctic Ocean are very sparse. The L-band microwave radiometer on board of NASA SMAP mission provides salinity measurements since April 2015, at 40 km resolution with global ocean coverage in similar to 3 days. With improved land/ice correction and RFI detection, SMAP SSS are retrieved in ice-free regions near the river mouth and ice edge. The collocated SMAP SSS and in situ salinity data collected by AXCTD from Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) 2016 field campaign along Greenland coast show reasonable agreement in revealing the freshening signature, which is not seen in ocean model output. During the open water season (August), SMAP SSS were retrieved in Chukchi Sea (2015), in Prudhoe Bay and East Siberian Sea (2016), and in Kara Sea in both years. The SSS contrast between the two years is consistent with sea ice concentration observations. Variability of SSS in Kara Sea is correlated positively with adjacent river discharges but negatively with the salinity of water transported from Atlantic Ocean.

ESTIMATING LIVE FUEL MOISTURE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA USING REMOTE SENSING VEGETATION WATER CONTENT PROXIES	IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2018	Valencia, SPAIN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy		Wildfire; live fuel moisture; SMAP; soil moisture; vegetation water content; remote sensing; recurrent neural network; Southern California		Wildfires are a major ecological disturbance in Southern California and often lead to great destruction along the Wildland-Urban Interface. Live fuel moisture has been used as an important indicator of wildfire risk in measurements of vegetation water content. However, the limited field measurements of live fuel moisture in both time and space have affected the accuracy of wildfire risk estimations. Traditional estimation of live fuel moisture using remote sensing data was based on vegetation indices, indirect proxies of vegetation water content and subject to influence from weather conditions. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of estimating live fuel moisture using vegetation indices, Soil Moisture Active Passive L-band soil moisture data and the modeled vegetation water content using a nonlinear model based on VIs and the stem factor associated with remote sensing moisture data products. The stem factor describes the peak amount of water residing in stems of plants and varies by land cover. We also compared the outcomes from regression models and recurrent neural network using the same independent variables. We found the modeled vegetation water content outperformed vegetation indices and the L-band soil moisture observations, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between live fuel moisture and the remotely sensed vegetation signatures. We discuss our results which will improve the predictability of live fuel moisture.

However, our understanding of the relative toxicity of specific PM types-mixtures with different proportions of particles of various sizes, shapes, and compositions-is less well understood. Observations from space, in conjunction with data from surface monitors and chemical transport models, offer a practical means of generating frequent, high spatial resolution maps of PM concentrations in major population centers around the world. The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) investigation, currently in development, is motivated by the scientific and societal benefits of linking PM types with adverse health outcomes and the value of satellite observations for addressing this objective.

Together with various greenhouse gases, aerosols represent the most significant anthropogenic forcing responsible for climate change. However, uncertainties about the origin and composition of aerosol particles, their size distribution, concentration, spatial and temporal variability, make climate change prediction challenging. In order to quantify the influence of aerosols on the Earth's climate and to better validate climate models, information about their global abundance, properties and height distribution are needed. We use measurements of the Oxygen A and B bands from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) to retrieve aerosol parameters such as optical depth, height and effective radius. Aerosol retrievals are ill-posed because of the large spatial and temporal variability in their composition and vertical distribution. We compare several retrieval methods and determine the optimum technique for the retrieval algorithm.

However numerous land applications would benefit from the availability of soil moisture maps at higher resolution. For this reason, there is a large research effort to develop soil moisture products at higher resolution using, for instance, data acquired by the new ESA's Sentinel missions. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it presents the validation status of a pre-operational soil moisture product derived from Sentinel-1 at 1 km resolution. Second, it assesses the possibility of integrating Sentinel-2 data and additional ancillary information, such as parcel borders and high resolution soil texture maps, in order to obtain soil moisture maps at "field scale" resolution, i.e. similar to 0.1 km Case studies concerning agricultural sites located in Europe are presented.

The change in phase of the reflected signal is related to SWE for dry snow and snow depth for wet snow and the rate of change of phase is directly correlated to frequency of observation. The effect of vegetation was also evaluated by using measurements from two towers: one with no vegetation and one surrounded by small trees with heights of up to 3 meters. The phase measurement from the two sites had excellent correlation of 0.99 during the accumulation phase. The correlation between SWE and phase measurement was found to be between 0.95 and 0.98 during the accumulation phase. During the melt phase, negative correlation between 0.68 and 0.80 was found between snow depth and phase measurement.

The Airborne Snow Observatory, a coupled lidar and imaging spectrometer platform, has been monitoring time series of snow reflectance over entire mountain basins since 2013 and the ASO imaging spectrometer products, including albedo, build upon a legacy of algorithms for retrieving snow properties from the unique spectral signature of snow. Here, we present a ground validation of ASO spectral and broadband snow albedo from coincident ground measurements collected in Senator Beck Basin, San Juan Mountains, CO, USA during the February 2017 NASA SnowEx field campaign.

The mission is manifested for an ISS deployment with the ELaNa-23 launch, currently scheduled in May, 2018. Radar instruments have often been regarded as unsuitable for small satellite platforms due to their traditionally large size, weight, and power. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a novel architecture compatible with the 6U class. The RainCube mission will validate two key technologies in the space environment - a miniaturized Ka-band precipitation profiling radar that occupies similar to 2.5U and a 0.5m Ka-band deployable parabolic antenna stowed within 1.5U. The spacecraft bus is developed by Tyvak Nanosatellite Systems, who will be responsible for integration of the flight system and mission operations. RainCube is funded through the Science Mission Directorate's (SMD) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Science (ROSES) 2015 In-Space Validation of Earth Science Technologies (InVEST) solicitation with the goal of raising the instrument TRL to 7.

The TEMPEST concept is intended to improve understanding of cloud processes, by providing critical information on the temporal development of cloud and precipitation microphysics and by improving our understanding of some of the largest sources of uncertainty in cloud process models. TEMPEST millimeter-wave radiometers are able to perform observations inside the cloud to observe changes as the cloud begins to precipitate or ice accumulates inside the storm. The TEMPEST Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) mission is intended to reduce risk and demonstrate measurement capabilities for 6U-Class satellite constellations for Earth Science. The capabilities to be demonstrated include differential drag maneuvers to provide desired time separation in a 6U-Class satellites constellation. In addition, TEMPEST-D millimeter-wave radiometers will be cross-calibrated with space-borne radiometers with similar frequency channels. TEMPEST-D will provide radiometric observations at five millimeterwave frequencies from 89 to 183 GHz using a lowpower, compact instrument that is highly suitable for deployment on 6U-Class satellites.

In particular, we quantify the dielectric and scattering losses using GPR profiles acquired over mafic dunes and sand sheets in Oman, and on the karstic limestone in Qatar, which both present radar characteristics representative of substantial portions of the upper layer of most desert environments of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Understanding the amplitude and spatial variability of these losses will significantly support the ongoing development of airborne and orbital VHF sounders dedicated to large-scale groundwater mapping in hyper-arid areas [1]. Our results suggest that VHF radars with 80-100dB effective dynamic range at the surface are capable of probing the water table in hyper-arid sedimentary environments up to 70-120 m of depth, hence covering most of the shallow aquifers located in the considered area. We observe that dielectric absorption is the main loss factor in aeolian deposits, while volume scattering, controls similar to 60% of the overall losses in karstic environments.

The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) is a landscape-level monitoring system that provides ongoing multi-year remote sensing measurements over mountainous ecosystems to primary quantify snow volume and dynamics. It collects low-resolution lidar data (similar to 1.5 pt/m(2)) with a nominal weekly frequency up to 12 times a year with measurements that span 2013-2017 over 12 mountain watersheds across the western US that currently face ecological threads. In this work, we present a method to automatically register ASO weekly low-resolution lidar point clouds in order to calculate spatially consistent datasets (similar to 12 pt/m(2)) adapted to fine scale forestry studies. We test the method using 12 lidar datasets acquired over the Tuolumne River Basin (Sierra Nevada, California) in the spring and summer of 2014. On average, the ASO lidar system provides accurate measurements in terms of geolocation (0.38m and 0.12m for the horizontal and vertical dimension, respectively) but some datasets are biased up to 1.38m and 0.53m, respectively. Our registration method successfully corrected for systematic bias improving the 3D geometry of forest point clouds.

The retrieved SSH was compared with the SSH measurement from a tide gauge located at the platform; the error in retrieval of Ku-band and K-band was found to be 2.78 cm and 2.58 cm, respectively. This matched the model for error with some differences that can be attributed to the difference in spatial and temporal characteristics of the SoOp and tide gauge measurements. Finally, this paper gives an overview of temporal and spatial sampling possible from a constellation of receivers observing Ku-band SoOp to resolve mesoscale eddies in coastal regions.

To address this issue, various super-resolution (SR) image reconstruction techniques have been developed to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution, noisy and blurry observations. In this paper, we propose an efficient super-resolution image reconstruction method for geometrically deformed remote sensing images, based on the nonlocal total variation (NLTV) regularization. The proposed minimization problem is solved by a fast primal-dual algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

When used operationally, a tradeoff must usually be made between the covered area and the quantity of information collected by the radar. To identify the most appropriate imaging mode, a methodology based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis has been applied to an original dataset collected by an airborne system, SETHI, characterized by a very low instrument noise floor. The dataset was acquired during an oil spill clean-up exercise carried out in 2015 in the North Sea. Various polarization-dependent quantities are investigated and a relative ordering of the main polarimetric parameters is reported. VV offers the best tradeoff between the benefit of detection performance and the instrument and data requirements. When the sensor has a sufficiently low noise floor, HV is also recommended because it provides strong slick-sea contrast. Among all the investigated quad-polarimetric settings, no significant added value compared to single-polarized data was found.

We train the SVM with LiDAR samples and different polarimetric variables based on 5000 samples (less than 1% of the full subset) collected across the images using a stratified random sampling approach. The trained SVM was applied to the rest of the image using the same variables but excluding the LiDAR samples.

Backscatter is assumed to change over time due to diurnal variations in soil and canopy water content as well as precipitations. A two-layer SAR backscatter model traditionally used for above-ground biomass retrieval is augmented here with the time dimension in order to guide the data analysis. The model is informed by examining a 5-year time-series of 32 L-band polarimetric UAVSAR images acquired over a vegetated area near the Sacramento Delta in California. Our initial results reported in this paper show that the temporal variability of soil and vegetation backscatter in absence of precipitation events fits well a lognormal probability distribution with mean and standard deviation related to each other. Characterizing the diurnal, seasonal and interannual variability of L-band backscatter may be critical for the successful estimation of ecosystem variables from dense time-series to be acquired globally by the NISAR mission.

However, the delay-Doppler maps (DDM) that are produced can be used to estimate the sea surface height (SSH) at the specular reflection point on the ocean surface. Proofof- concept studies that DDMs are suitable to solve for SSH have been recently reported (Clarizia et al., 2016; Mashburn et al., 2018), based on data acquired by the demonstration satellite experiment Tech Demo Sat -1 (TDS-1) carrying a GNSS-R receiver similar to the ones onboard CYGNSS. Although the precision of each 1sec averaged SSH is considerably lower than that of the existing satellite altimeters, by virtue of the dense coverage and frequent revisit time exhibited by the constellation of 8 microsats, the error may be smoothed down considerably by optimal interpolation (Li et al., 2016). Hence the CYGNSS dataset presents a potential opportunity to sample the tropical oceans, and investigate the sensitivity of the SSH measurements to mesoscale eddies.

The L-band signals recorded by CYGNSS have been shown to be sensitive to land surface hydrologic variables, including near-surface soil moisture and inundation extent. However, given certain conditions-such as vegetation cover and surface roughness, CYGNSS observations may be more or less sensitive to these variables. The pseudo-random sampling strategy used by CYGNSS presents new opportunities but also new challenges to the monitoring of land surface hydrology. This work, using South America as a case study, quantifies the ability of CYGNSS to monitor soil moisture and inundation extent for different vegetation and roughness conditions and describes how these measurements could be used to sense changes in surface hydrology over time.

For this objective, the OIB/TanDEM-X Coordinated Science Campaign (OTASC) was successfully conducted in 2017 to obtain contemporaneous and collocated remote sensing data from NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) TanDEM-X Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system at X band together with Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 SARs at C band in conjunction with WorldView satellite spectral sensors, surface measurements, and field observations. The Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea were two primary regions while SAR data were also collected over six other regions in the Southern Ocean. Satellite SAR data included both polarimetric and interferometric capabilities to infer snow and sea ice information in three dimensions (3D), while OIB/P-3 aircraft data include snow radar together with altimeter data for snow and sea ice observations in 3D over the Weddell Sea. Across the Ross Sea, IcePOD and AntNZ/York-University flights were carried out together with satellite SAR data acquisitions.

This information is urgently needed to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle and to reduce uncertainties in the calculation of carbon stocks and fluxes associated to the terrestrial biosphere. It is also crucial for approaches to managing climate, such as the UNFCCC initiative known as Reducing Emissions through Degradation and Deforestation (REDD+), aimed at climate change mitigation through conservation and better management of tropical forests The required measurements are forest biomass and forest height at resolution of 200 m, and detection of deforestation at 50 m. Global maps of biomass are required with accuracy of 20% (or 10 t ha(-1) when above-ground biomass are less than 50 t ha(-1)). To achieve this Biomass will be implemented as a P-band SAR mission. It will exploit the unique sensitivity of P-band SAR together with advanced retrieval methods including polarimetric interferometry (Pol-InSAR) and SAR tomography to measure biomass, height and disturbances across the entire biomass range every 6 months. The mission will also support important secondary objectives, including sub-surface imaging in arid zones, production of a bare-earth DTM and ice applications.

Measuring the three dimensional structure of vegetation and its changes resulting from either natural or anthropogenic causes are key parameters in monitoring ecosystems. The NASA/JPL UAVSAR system has deployed to multiple sites including Alaska over the last several years to conduct tomographic SAR observations at L-band and P-band. This talk will provide a brief overview of a tomographic SAR experiment conducted in the boreal forests of Alaska in August and September of 2017 at both L and P-bands. This site consists mostly of relatively short vegetation with mean height less than 20 m and maximal height less than 25 m. It is sparse compared with previous temperate and tropical forest tomographic observations made by UAVSAR. These observations provides a unique data set to compare tomographic data at L and P-bands for this type of biome.

Recent studies suggest that the uncertainty in estimating agb of large trees is significantly reduced if tree height and crown size are accounted for in addition to the traditional trunk diameter and wood density. Due to the fact that field inventory techniques are not adapted to characterize the 3D forest structure, crown size metrics (e.g. height and radius) are commonly estimated as a function of trunk diameter using allometric models with limitations in explaining crown variability. Airborne lidar techniques have the potential for characterizing tree height and crown size but are not adapted to estimate trunk diameter, which is a strong predictor of agb. Here, we investigate the synergy of field inventory and airborne lidar techniques to characterize the forest structure by assessing the uncertainty introduced by the field-based allometric models in the estimation of agb at the tree-level. We focus in 1454 large individual trees (trunk diameter > 60 cm) located within the La Selva Biological Station for which we dispose of field observations (trunk diameter and wood density) and lidar derived metrics (tree height and crown radius). We show that the field-based allometric models overestimate tree height and underestimate crown radius. As a result, the allometric approach overestimates the tree-level agb in 0.8 Mg when considering the 1454 individuals and the errors can reach more than 50% of the agb of individual trees. These errors on the large trees agb highly impact on the plot-level results and then propagate to the estimation of carbon stocks at the regional and national-levels.

The SAPARC is intended for radiometric and polarimetric calibration of both airborne and spaceborne L-band radars, including the NASA/JPL Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) and NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR). The presented Polarimetric Active Radar Calibrator (PARC) is designed to have a specific scattering matrix response (equal entries) and a very large and stable radar cross section (RCS) value which is significantly higher than its passive counterparts for providing a much higher signal-to-clutter ratio. The specific scattering matrix response enables the PARC to evaluate all the radar channels' radiometric calibration constants as well as cross-talk and channel imbalances, which cannot be estimated by the passive calibration targets. The much higher signal-to-clutter ratio provided by the PARC further reduces the residual errors of calibration and allows them to be easily deployed at different target scenes during radar data acquisitions.

The presence of heavily rimed particles within the instrument field of view generates significant signal enhancements at the Ka band caused by multiple scattering (MS). MS and NUBF introduce large ambiguities in the estimate of effective reflectivity below the freezing level (FL), especially at Ka band, which strongly reduces DPR capabilities for detecting hail at the ground.

After several years of development VEM has a mature design with an existing laboratory prototype verifying an achievable instrument SNR of well above 1000 as well as a predicted error in the retrieval of relative emissivity of better than 1%. With that it will provide a global map of surface composition as well as redox state of the surface by observing the surface with six narrow band filters, ranging from 0.86 to 1.18 mu m. Continuous observation of Venus' thermal emission will place tight constraints on current day volcanic activity. Eight additional channels provide measurements of atmospheric water vapor abundance as well as cloud microphysics and dynamics and permit accurate correction of atmospheric interference on the surface data. A mission combining VEM with a high-resolution radar mapper such as the ESA EnVision or NASA VERITAS mission proposals will provide key insights in the divergent evolution of Venus.

Approaches to date try to retrieve surface precipitation, to which the observations are not directly sensitive. Millimeter wavelengths are most sensitive to the scattering from hydrometeors in the cloud upper levels. Millimeter-wavelength radiometers have a definite advantage over the lower frequency radiometers in that they have finer spatial resolution to resolve deep convection. Preliminary analyses indicate that the measurements are indeed sensitive to the depth and intensity of convection. The challenge is to derive a robust approach to estimate the characteristics of the convection directly from the observations, and conversely to derive a robust forward representation of the dependence of the radiances on the underlying moisture fields. This is done in a two-step semi-empirical approach.

External and internal dynamical and thermodynamical variables act simultaneously in a nonlinear fashion, either complementing, amplifying, inhibiting or not impacting the TC intensity at all. We try to address the following question: What is the relative importance of the external and vortex-scale variables that influence rapid intensity changes within a TC? Further, which of these variables must be prioritized from an observational standpoint? To answer these questions, a systematic analysis was conducted on a large number of representative TCs to make statistically significant conclusions using discriminant analyses of wavenumber (WN)-filtered fields, with a principal component analysis to detect over-fitting and identify the subset of variables (from the environment and the vortex) consistently correlated with rapid intensity change. Our analyses indicate that a small number of variables wield the most influence on TC rapid intensity changes. The most important variables within the vortex are the WN 0 of precipitation within the radius of maximum winds, the amplitudes of WN 1 of precipitation and the mid-level horizontal moisture flux convergence in the rain band region. Likewise, the most important environmental variables are the angle of the driest air from the shear vector and the magnitude of environmental wind shear. These variables must be prioritized in future observational and consequent data assimilation efforts.	[Saiprasanth, B.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Haddad, Z.

Several previous studies have attributed these departures to shortfalls in the representation of microphysical processes, in particular those pertaining to ice processes. Others have suggested that our inabilities to properly represent processes such as entrainment are responsible. Wrapped up in these issues are aspects such as the model grid resolution, as well as accuracy of models to correctly simulate the environmental conditions. Four primary terms comprise the vertical momentum equation: advection, pressure gradient forcing, thermodynamics and turbulence. Microphysical processes including their impacts on latent heating and their contributions to condensate loading strongly impact the thermodynamic term. The focus of this study is on the thermodynamic contributions to vertical motion, the shortfalls that arise when modeling this term, and the observations that might be made to improve the representation of those thermodynamical processes driving convective updrafts and downdrafts.

The use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) holds promise in improving spatial reflectance uniformity and reducing the required thickness of the protective layers. Achieving a stable, pinhole-free, ultrathin (<3 nm) overcoat would allow protected Al mirrors to approach the ideal Al intrinsic reflectivity in the challenging, but spectrally-rich, 90-115 nm range. However, combining ALD methods with high performance evaporated Al layers has technical challenges associated with the formation of undesirable interfacial oxide. To overcome this issue, we demonstrate the use of thermal atomic layer etching (ALE) methods to remove this oxide prior to ALD encapsulation. This paper describes our continuing work to optimize new ALD processes for the metal fluoride materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. We also describe new work on low temperature (<200 degrees C) ALE methods utilizing a fluorination-volatilization approach that has been incorporated into our mirror development efforts. The scalability of this overall approach and the environmental stability of ALD/ALE Al mirrors is discussed in the context of possible future astrophysics applications such as the NASA LUVOIR and HabEx mission concepts. The use of this combined ALE/ALD method may also enable a fabrication platform in space that can renew or reconfigure protective overcoats on Al mirrors on-orbit, as an alternative to other space-based metal coating methods considered previously.

The Ultraviolet Spectrograph onboard Juno (Juno-UVS) is a photon-counting imaging spectrograph, designed to cover the 68-210nm spectral range.(1) This range includes the H-2 bands and the Lyman series produced in Jupiter's far-ultraviolet (FUV) auroras. The purpose of Juno-UVS is to study Jupiter's auroras from the unique vantage point above both poles allowed by Juno's orbit, and to provide a wider auroral context for the in-situ particle and field instruments on Juno. Because of the 2 rpm spin of Juno, UVS nominally observes 7.5 degrees x360 degrees swaths of the sky during each spin of the spacecraft. The spatial resolutions along the slit and across the slit, i.e. in the spin direction, are respectively 0.16 degrees and 0.2 degrees, while the filled-slit spectral resolution is similar to.3 nm.(2) UVS borrows heavily from previous instruments led by Southwest Research Institute (New-Horizons and Rosetta Alices, LRO-LAMP), major improvements are: (i) an extensive radiation shielding; (ii) a scan mirror which allows targeting specific auroral features; and (iii) an improved cross-delay line readout scheme of the microchannel plate (MCP) detector. The ability offered by the scan mirror combined with Juno's spin allows UVS access to half of the sky during every spacecraft rotation. This pointing flexibility, combined with the changing spin-axis of the spacecraft since launch, has allowed UVS to map 99% of the sky in the 68-210nm range. This paper describes the substantial number of spectra that have been used to monitor the health of the instrument over the course of the mission. More than 5800 spectra of mainly O, A, and B spectral-type stars in the V-magnitude range of similar to 0-7 have been extracted to date. Selected stars among this list are used to calibrate the UVS instrument. This paper describes how previous spectral databases from the International Ultraviolet Explorer have been refined and adapted for UVS' calibration purposes, in combination with observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. The retrieved effective area of the instrument peaks around 0.28 at similar to 125 nm, with uncertainties lower than 10%.	[Hue, V.; Kammer, J.; Gladstone, G. R.; Greathouse, T. K.; Davis, M.

A successor to the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), a NASA Small Explorer launched in 2012, HEX-P addresses key NASA science objectives, and will serve as an important complement to ESA's L-class Athena mission. HEX-P will utilize multilayer coated X-ray optics, and in this paper we present the details of the optical design, and discuss the multilayer prescriptions necessary for the reflection of hard X-ray photons. We consider multiple module designs with the aim of investigating the tradeoff between high- and low-energy effective area, and review the technology development necessary to reach that goal within the next decade.

Roughly 40 billion M dwarfs in our galaxy host at least one small planet in the habitable zone (HZ). The stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation from M dwarfs is strong and highly variable, and impacts planetary atmospheric loss, composition and habitability. These effects are amplified by the extreme proximity of their HZs (0.1-0.4 AU). Knowing the UV environments of M dwarf planets will be crucial to understanding their atmospheric composition and a key parameter in discriminating between biological and abiotic sources for observed biosignatures. The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) will be a 6U CubeSat devoted to photometric monitoring of M stars in the far-UV and near-UV, measuring the time-dependent spectral slope, intensity and evolution of low-mass star high-energy radiation.

Of particular interest are advanced deposition processes that have increased the performance of Lithium Fluoride (LiF) overcoated mirrors while mitigating the procedures required for their handling, raising the reflectivity from similar to 65% to greater than 80% in the Lyman UV (lambda > 1000 angstrom). Traditional magnesium fluride (MgF2) protected aluminum mirrors have a reflectivity truncated at 1150 angstrom, missing crucial tracers of warm gas and molecules. The hygroscopic sensitivity of LiF has traditionally added to mission risk and cost. The addition of a thin capping layer of another material (AlF3, MgF2) on top of the LiF has been shown to mitigate the degradation by providing a barrier against moisture. These advances open up a new paradigm in UV astronomy by enabling multi{passed optical designs without the crippling 1000 - 1150 angstrom throughput losses inherent to conventional mirror coatings. We present recent progress in the testing of enhanced lithium fluoride (eLiF) coated optics, and discuss potential instrument concepts for UV astronomy in the next decade.

Ultraviolet is one of the frontier in the transient astronomy. To open up the discovery space, we are developing a 6U CubeSat for transient exploration. The possible targets will be supernova shock-breakouts, tidal disruption events, and the blue emission from NS-NS mergers in very early phase. If we only focused on nearby/bright sources, the required detection limit is around 20 mag (AB). To avoid the background and optical light, we chose a waveband of 230-280 nm. As an imaging detector, we employ a delta-doped back-illuminated CMOS. In addition to delta doping, the multi-layer coating directly deposited on the detector enables both a high in-band UV QE and the ultra-low optical rejection ratio. Taking into account these specifications, even an 8 cm telescope can achieve the detection limit of 20 mag(AB) for a FoV larger than 60 deg(2). We also designed the satellite bus system for this mission by utilizing commercially available cubesat components satisfying the mission requirements.

The system is quite nearby for a microlensing planet, D-L = 0.86 +/- 0.09 kpc. Indeed, it was the large lens-source relative parallax pi(rel) = 1.0 mas (combined with the low mass M) that gave rise to the large, and thus well-measured, "microlens parallax" pi(E) proportional to (pi(rel)/M)(1/2) that enabled these precise measurements. OGLE-2017-BLG-1434Lb is the eighth microlensing planet with planet-host mass ratio q < 1 x 10(-4). We apply a new planet-detection sensitivity method, which is a variant of "V/V-max", to seven of these eight planets to derive the mass-ratio function in this regime. We find dN/ d lnq proportional to q(P) , with p =1.05(-0.68)(+0.78), which confirms the "turnover" in the mass function found by Suzuki et al. relative to the power law of opposite sign n = -0.93 +/- 0.13 at higher mass ratios q greater than or similar to 2 x 10(-4).

OGLE Collaboration; KMTNET Collaboration	OGLE-2017-BLG-0373Lb: A Jovian Mass-Ratio Planet Exposes A New Accidental Microlensing Degeneracy	ACTA ASTRONOMICA			English	Article						Gravitational lensing: micro; Planetary systems	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; PARALLAX; SYSTEMS; EVENTS; PERTURBATIONS; PHOTOMETRY; CAUSTICS; HALO	We report the discovery of microlensing planet OGLE-2017-BLG-0373Lb. We show that while the planet-host system has an unambiguous microlens topology, there are two geometries within this topology that fit the data equally well, which leads to a factor 2.5 difference in planet-host mass ratio, i.e., q = 1.5 x 10(-3) vs. q = 0.6 x 10(-3). We show that this is an "accidental degeneracy" in the sense that it is due to a gap in the data. We dub it "the caustic-chirality degeneracy". We trace the mathematical origins of this degeneracy, which should enable similar degenerate solutions to be easily located in the future. A Bayesian estimate, based on a Galactic model, yields a host mass M = 0.25(-0.15)(+0.30) M circle dot at a distance D-L = 5.9(-1.95)(+1.3) kpc. The lens-source relative proper motion is relatively fast, mu = 9 mas/yr, which implies that the host mass and distance can be determined by high-resolution imaging after about 10 years. The same observations could in principle resolve the discrete degeneracy in q, but this will be more challenging.

Optical index tunability of the PCM sitting on top of the cavity, results in tuning the device reflection spectrum and thus permits vivid color tuning. The phase change material used to achieve these results was Germanium Telluride (GeTe) due to its high stability. Specifically, ultra-thin films of GeTe was grown on top of a SiO2 cavity with a bottom palladium reflector in a Fabery-Perot type design. This enhances the color tuning when a double-layer anti-reflection coating with high and low refractive indexes are used on top of the GeTe film. Low sensitivity to incident light angle and polarization without the need of sub-micron lithography, provide the potential for this device to be very useful for portable device applications. The devices with different thickness of GeTe were fabricated to demonstrate green, red, blue colors. Electrical pulses with different periods and duty cycles were used to switch the phase of the GeTe locally using joule heating method for several cycles. After transition, darker green, blue, and purple colors were shown for devices with 8 to 20 nm thickness of GeTe films.	[Jafari, Mohsen; Guo, L.

This aids in high contrast imaging, particularly for low mass stars where the star-to-planet brightness ratio is reduced. Here we discuss the combination of infrared detector technology with the highly sensitive Pyramid wavefront sensor (WFS) for a new generation of systems. Such sensors can extend the capabilities of current telescopes and meet the requirements for future instruments, such as those proposed for the giant segmented mirror telescopes. Here we introduce the infrared Pyramid WFS and discuss the advantages and challenges of this sensor. We present a new infrared Pyramid WFS for Keck, a key sub-system of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC). The design, integration and testing is reported on, with a focus on the characterization of the SAPHIRA detector used to provide the H-band wavefront sensing. Initial results demonstrate a required effective read noise < 1e(-) at high gain.

The high-contrast imaging system serves as a spatial filter to separate the light from the star and the planet while the high-resolution spectrograph acts as a spectral filter, which differentiates between features in the stellar and planetary spectra. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) located downstream from the current W. M. Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system will contain a fiber injection unit (FIU) combining a high-contrast imaging system and a fiber feed to Keck's high resolution infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC. Resolved thermal emission from known young giant exoplanets will be injected into a single-mode fiber linked to NIRSPEC, thereby allowing the spectral characterization of their atmospheres. Moreover, the resolution of NIRSPEC (R = 37,500 after upgrade) is high enough to enable spin measurements and Doppler imaging of atmospheric weather phenomenon. The module was integrated at Caltech and shipped to Hawaii at the beginning of 2018 and is currently undergoing characterization. Its transfer to Keck is planned in September and first on-sky tests sometime in December.	[Delorme, J.

Optimizing optics and opto-mechanical mounting to minimize static aberrations in high-contrast instruments	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems VI	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	SPIE, 4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment, Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel, Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst, Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		High Contrast Imaging; Instrumentation; Opto-Mechanical Systems		One of the goals of high-contrast imaging is to reach contrasts of 10-10 at small inner working angles to directly image Earth-like exoplanets around solar-type stars. In most imaging systems, a deformable mirror (DM) in the pupil plane can correct for phase errors but surface errors in out-of-pupil optics get coupled into amplitude errors which can only be controlled with a second, out of pupil, DM. Furthermore, correcting static errors introduced by the optics can take up valuable DM stroke. Thus, minimizing the wavefront error within the system is critical to reaching high contrast levels. For example, the High Contrast Spectroscopy for Segmented Telescopes Testbed (HCST) in the Exoplanet Technologoy lab at Caltech aims to develop exoplanet imaging technologies down to small inner working angles (< 3A/D) which requires an RMS wavefront error of less than 10 nm per optic to achieve a contrast of 10-5 with the DM flattened. While aligning HCST, it was determined that despite the excellent surface quality of all the optics, the mounts were introducing significant wavefront errors. Here we assess the effect of mount-induced wavefront errors that can rapidly consume the wavefront budget of a high-contrast system. We also present the method used to mitigate this effect within HCST such that a mean contrast of 6 x 10(-6) from 3-10A/D was achieved with a vortex coronagraph and flattened DM.

In this second installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop (see also 1,2), we present an overview of common path wavefront sensing/control and Coherent Differential Imaging techniques, highlight the latest results, and expose their relative strengths and weaknesses. We layout critical milestones for the field with the aim of enhancing future ground/space based high contrast imaging platforms. Techniques like these will help to bridge the daunting contrast gap required to image a terrestrial planet in the zone where it can retain liquid water, in reflected light around a G type star from space.

SCExAO has a dual purpose. Its position in the northern hemisphere on a 8-meter telescope makes it a prime instrument for the detection and characterization of exoplanets and stellar environments over a large portion of the sky. In addition, SCExAO's unique design makes it the ideal instrument to test innovative technologies and algorithms quickly in a laboratory setup and subsequently deploy them on-sky. SCExAO benefits from a first stage of wavefront correction with the facility adaptive optics A0188, and splits the 600-2400 nm spectrum towards a variety of modules, in visible and near infrared, optimized for a large range of science cases. The integral field spectrograph CHARIS, with its J, H or K-band high-resolution mode or its broadband low-resolution mode, makes SCExAO a prime instrument for exoplanet detection and characterization. Here we report on the recent developments and scientific results of the SCExAO instrument. Recent upgrades were performed on a number of modules, like the visible polarimetric module VAMPIRES, the high-performance infrared coronagraphs, various wavefront control algorithms, as well as the real-time controller of A0188. The newest addition is the 20k-pixel Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKIDS) Exoplanet Camera (MEC) that will allow for previously unexplored science and technology developments. MEC, coupled with novel photon-counting speckle control, brings SCExAO closer to the final design of future high-contrast instruments optimized for Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs).

Simulations show that errors in the compensated phase on the aperture due to servo-lag have preferential direction orthogonal to the direction of wind propagation which, when Fourier Transformed into the image plane, appear with their characteristic lemniscate shape along the wind direction. We develop a metric to quantify the effect of this aberration with the fractional standard deviation in an annulus centered around the PSF, and use telescope pointing to correlate this effect with data from an atmospheric models, the NOAA GFS. Our results show that the jet stream at altitudes of 100-200 hPa (equivalently 10-15 km above sea level) is highly correlated (13.2u) with the strong butterfly, while the ground wind and other layers are more or less uncorrelated.

Low Wind Effect on VLT/SPHERE : impact, mitigation strategy, and results	ADAPTIVE OPTICS SYSTEMS VI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Adaptive Optics Systems VI	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	SPIE, 4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment, Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel, Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst, Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Low Wind Effect; SPHERE; Radiative Cooling; Spiders; Island Effect	AO SYSTEM	The low wind effect is a phenomenon disturbing the phase of the wavefront in the pupil of a large telescope obstructed by spiders, in the absence of wind. It can be explained by the radiative cooling of the spiders, creating air temperature inhomogeneities across the pupil. Because it is unseen by traditional adaptive optics (AO) systems, thus uncorrected, it significantly degrades the quality of AO-corrected images. We provide a statistical analysis of the strength of this effect as seen by VLT/SPHERE after 4 years of operations. We analyse its dependence upon the wind and temperature conditions. We describe the mitigation strategy implemented in 2017: a specific coating with low thermal emissivity in the mid-infrared was applied on the spiders of Unit Telescope 3. We quantify the improvement in terms of image quality, contrast and wave front error using both focal plane images and measured phase maps.

There is a great deal of overlap between the requirements for laser communication AO and high-contrast exoplanet imaging AO systems. Both require very high Strehl ratios with narrow fields of view. This overlap allows the IOS to serve as a testbed and technology demonstrator for astronomical extreme adaptive optics systems. There are several example technologies from the IOS that are already making the transition to astronomical AO systems. The first is that the real time controller based on Direct Memory Access transfer between the WFS camera link frame-grabber and a DSP board is being reused on the upgrade to PALM-3000 AO system at Palomar Observatory. This enables the system to minimize latency by bypassing the CPU and its inherent timing jitter. Technologies like this will be crucial to enabling high contrast imaging on the next generation of extremely large telescopes. In addition, the IOS measures Fried's parameter from wavefraont measures in near real time. This technology has already been deployed to PALM-3000. The main function of Laser Communication AO systems is to couple the incoming light into single mode fiber. This is the same con figuration that will be used by AO coupled radial velocity spectrographs. The adaptive optics system is a woofer/tweeter design, with one deformable mirror correcting for low spatial frequencies with large amplitude and a second deformable mirror correcting for high spatial frequencies with small amplitude. The system uses a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. The system has achieved first light and is undergoing commissioning. We will present an overview of the system design and initial performance.

We present the results of tests of deformable mirrors from Microscale. One of the key innovations of these deformable mirrors is that the facesheet is created from a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with integral posts for mechanical linkage to the actuators. This dramatically reduces the variability of the influence function. The facesheet is bonded to an array of piezoelectric stack actuators. The actuators are currently PZT, but single crystal PMN actuators are being developed. We present results of optical and electrical tests of the performance of the DM.

Frazin (ApJ, 2013) introduced a post-processing algorithm demonstrating that simultaneous millisecond exposures in the science camera and wavefront sensor (WFS) can be used with a statistical inference procedure to determine both the series expanded NCPA coefficients and the planetary signal. We demonstrate, via simulation, that using this algorithm in a closed-loop AO system, real-time estimation and correction of the quasi-static NCPA is possible without separate deformable mirror (DM) probes. Thus the use of this technique allows for the removal of the quasi-static speckles that can be mistaken for planetary signals without the need for new optical hardware, improving the efficiency of ground-based exoplanet detection. In our simulations, we explore the behavior of the Frazin Algorithm (FA) and the dependence of its convergence to an accurate estimate on factors such as Strehl ratio, NCPA strength, and number of algorithm search basis functions. We then apply this knowledge to simulate running the algorithm in real-time in a nearly ideal setting. We then discuss adaptations that can be made to the algorithm to improve its real-time performance, and show their efficacy in simulation. A final simulation tests the technique's resilience against imperfect knowledge of the AO residual phase, motivating an analysis of the feasibility of using this technique in a real closed-loop Extreme AO system such as SCExAO or MagAO-X, in terms of computational complexity and the accuracy of the estimated quasi-static NCPA correction.

At the Subaru telescope this is achieved using the 188-element facility adaptive optics system(A0188) feeding the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument; a multipurpose instrument built to deliver high contrast images of planets and disks around nearby stars. A0188 offers coarse correction while SCExAO performs fine correction and calibration of 1000 modes. The full system achieves 90%Strehl Ratio in H-band and diffraction limited images. A new Real Time Computer allowing higher performance between SCExAO and A0188 is currently implemented. Future upgrades will include a new Pyramid Wavefront Sensor and (64x64) DM to achieve extreme AO correction inside A0188. We are progressing in the development of predictive control and sensor fusion algorithms across the system to improve performance and calibration. With the new upgrades, SCExAO will be able to image giant plan-ets in reflected light with Subaru and validate technologies necessary to image habitable Earth-like planets with the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).

To date, GPIES has observed nearly 500 targets, and generated over 30,000 individual exposures using its integral field spectrograph (IFS) instrument. The GPIES team has developed a campaign data system that includes a database incorporating all of the metadata collected along with all individual raw data products, including environmental conditions and instrument performance metrics. In addition to the raw data, the same database also indexes metadata associated with multiple levels of reduced data products, including contrast measures for individual images and combined image sequences, which serve as the primary metric of performance for the final science products. Finally, the database is used to track telemetry products from the GPI adaptive optics (AO) subsystem, and associate these with corresponding IFS data. Here, we discuss several data exploration and visualization projects enabled by the GPIES database. Of particular interest are any correlations between instrument performance (final contrast) and environmental or operating conditions. We show single and multiple-parameter fits of single-image and observing sequence contrast as functions of various seeing measures, and discuss automated outlier rejection and other fitting concerns. We also explore unsupervised learning techniques, and self-organizing maps, in particular, in order to produce low-dimensional mappings of the full metadata space, in order to provide new insights on how instrument performance may correlate with various factors. Supervised learning techniques are then employed in order to partition the space of raw (single image) to final (full sequence) contrast in order to better predict the value of the final data set from the first few completed observations. Finally, we discuss the particular features of the database design that aid in performing these analyses, and suggest potential future upgrades and refinements.

However, the signal-to-noise ratio of the planet signal is limited by the coupling of starlight into the single mode fiber. To minimize this coupling, we need to apply a control loop on the stellar wavefront at the input of the fiber. We present here a wavefront control algorithm based on the formalism of the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) controller that accounts for the effect of the fiber. The control output is the overlap integral of the electric field with the fundamental mode of a single mode fiber. This overlap integral is estimated by sending probes to a deformable mirror. We present results from simulations, and laboratory results obtained at the Caltech Exoplanet Technology Lab's transmissive testbed. We show that our approach offers a significant improvement in starlight suppression through the fiber relative to a conventional EFC controller. This new approach improves the contrast of a high contrast instrument and could be used in future missions.

The GPI Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) is a 600 stars campaign aiming at detecting and characterizing young, massive and self-luminous exoplanets at large orbital distances (> 5 au). Science observations are taken simultaneously with environmental data revealing information about the turbulence in the telescope environment as well as limitations of GPI's AO system. Previous work has shown that the timescale of the turbulence, To, is a strong predictor of AO performance, however an analysis of the dome turbulence on AO performance has not been done before. Here, we study correlations between image contrast and residual wavefront error (WFE) with temperature measurements from multiple locations inside and outside the dome. Our analysis revealed GPI's performance is most correlated with the temperature difference between the primary mirror of the telescope and the outside air. We also assess the impact of the current temperature control and ventilation strategy at Gemini South (GS).

In particular, outdoor places are more difficult targets than indoor ones due to perceptual variations, such as dynamic illuminance over 24 hours and occlusions by cars and pedestrians. This paper presents a novel method of categorizing outdoor places using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which take omnidirectional depth/reflectance images obtained by 3D LiDARs as the inputs. First, we construct a large-scale outdoor place dataset named Multi-modal Panoramic 3D Outdoor (MPO) comprising two types of point clouds captured by two different LiDARs. They are labeled with six outdoor place categories: coast, forest, indoor/outdoor parking, residential area, and urban area. Second, we provide CNNs for LiDAR-based outdoor place categorization and evaluate our approach with the MPO dataset. Our results on the MPO dataset outperform traditional approaches and show the effectiveness in which we use both depth and reflectance modalities. To analyze our trained deep networks, we visualize the learned features.

Resolution optimization of an off-axis lensless digital holographic microscope	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							PHASE-CONTRAST MICROSCOPY; QUANTITATIVE PHASE; MOTILITY; SUPERRESOLUTION; ABERRATIONS; ENVIRONMENT; TOMOGRAPHY; ENCELADUS; COMPACT; SAMPLES	Microscopes aimed at detecting cellular life in extreme environments such as ocean-bearing solar system moons must provide high resolution in a compact, robust instrument. Here, we consider the resolution optimization of a compact off-axis lensless digital holographic microscope (DHM) that consists of a sample placed between an input point-source pair and a detector array. Two optimal high-resolution regimes are identified at opposite extremes-a low-magnification regime with the sample located near a small-pixel detector array, and a high-magnification regime with the sample near the input plane. In the former, resolution improves with smaller pixels, while in the latter, the effect of the finite pixel size is obviated, and the spatial resolution improves with detector array size. Using an off-axis lensless DHM with a 2k x 2k array of 5.5 mu m-pixels in the high-magnification regime, and standard aberration correction software, a resolution of similar to 0.95 mu m has been demonstrated, a factor of 5.8 smaller than the pixel size. Our analysis further suggests that with yet larger detector arrays, a lensless DHM should be capable of near wavelength-scale resolution.

Vital Signs: Seismology of Icy Ocean Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article							GALILEO PHOTOPOLARIMETER-RADIOMETER; THERMAL EVOLUTION; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; TIDAL DISSIPATION; SEISMIC DETECTION; SUBSURFACE OCEAN; AMMONIUM-SULFATE; SHELL THICKNESS; GRAVITY-FIELD; I SHELLS	Ice-covered ocean worlds possess diverse energy sources and associated mechanisms that are capable of driving significant seismic activity, but to date no measurements of their seismic activity have been obtained. Such investigations could reveal the transport properties and radial structures, with possibilities for locating and characterizing trapped liquids that may host life and yielding critical constraints on redox fluxes and thus on habitability. Modeling efforts have examined seismic sources from tectonic fracturing and impacts. Here, we describe other possible seismic sources, their associations with science questions constraining habitability, and the feasibility of implementing such investigations. We argue, by analogy with the Moon, that detectable seismic activity should occur frequently on tidally flexed ocean worlds. Their ices fracture more easily than rocks and dissipate more tidal energy than the <1 GW of the Moon and Mars. Icy ocean worlds also should create less thermal noise due to their greater distance and consequently smaller diurnal temperature variations. They also lack substantial atmospheres (except in the case of Titan) that would create additional noise. Thus, seismic experiments could be less complex and less susceptible to noise than prior or planned planetary seismology investigations of the Moon or Mars.

DES Collaboration	Forward Global Photometric Calibration of the Dark Energy Survey	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational; techniques: photometric	SOFTWARE	Many scientific goals for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) require the calibration of optical/NIR broadband b = grizY photometry that is stable in time and uniform over the celestial sky to one percent or better. It is also necessary to limit to similar accuracy systematic uncertainty in the calibrated broadband magnitudes due to uncertainty in the spectrum of the source. Here we present a "Forward Global Calibration Method (FGCM)" for photometric calibration of the DES, and we present results of its application to the first three years of the survey (Y3A1). The FGCM combines data taken with auxiliary instrumentation at the observatory with data from the broadband survey imaging itself and models of the instrument and atmosphere to estimate the spatial and time dependences of the passbands of individual DES survey exposures. "Standard" passbands that are typical of the passbands encountered during the survey are chosen. The passband of any individual observation is combined with an estimate of the source spectral shape to yield a magnitude m(b)(std) in the standard system. This " chromatic correction" to the standard system is necessary to achieve subpercent calibrations and in particular, to resolve ambiguity between the broadband brightness of a source and the shape of its SED. The FGCM achieves a reproducible and stable photometric calibration of standard magnitudes m(b)(std) of stellar sources over the multiyear Y3A1 data sample with residual random calibration errors of sigma = 6-7 mmag per exposure. The accuracy of the calibration is uniform across the 5000 deg(2) DES footprint to within sigma = 7 mmag. The systematic uncertainties of magnitudes in the standard system due to the spectra of sources are less than 5 mmag for main-sequence stars with 0.5 < g-i < 3.0.	[Burke, D. L.; Rykoff, E.

KMTnet Collaboration; OGLE Collaboration; UKIRT Microlensing Team	OGLE-2017-BLG-0173Lb: Low-mass-ratio Planet in a "Hollywood" Microlensing Event	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; planetary systems	GRAVITATIONAL LENSING EXPERIMENT; GALACTIC BULGE; SYSTEMS; STARS; PHOTOMETRY	We present microlensing planet OGLE-2017-BLG-0173Lb, with planet-host mass ratio of either q similar or equal to 2.5 x 10(-5) or q similar or equal to 6.5 x 10(-5), the lowest or among the lowest ever detected. The planetary perturbation is strongly detected, Delta chi(2) similar to 10000, because it arises from a bright (therefore, large) source passing over and enveloping the planetary caustic: a so-called "Hollywood" event. The factor similar to 2.5 offset in q arises because of a previously unrecognized discrete degeneracy between Hollywood events in which the caustic is fully enveloped and those in which only one flank is enveloped, which we dub "Cannae" and "von Schlieffen," respectively. This degeneracy is "accidental" in that it arises from gaps in the data. Nevertheless, the fact that it appears in a Delta chi(2) = 10000 planetary anomaly is striking. We present a simple formalism to estimate the sensitivity of other Hollywood events to planets and show that they can lead to detections close to, but perhaps not quite reaching, the Earth/Sun mass ratio of 3 x 10(-6). This formalism also enables an analytic understanding of the factor similar to 2.5 offset in q between the Cannae and von Schlieffen solutions. The Bayesian estimates for the host mass, system distance, and planet-host projected separation are M = 0.39(-0.24)(+0.40) M circle dot, D-L = 4.8(-1.8)(+1.5) kpc, and a(perpendicular to) = 3.8 +/- 1.6 au, respectively. The two estimates of the planet mass are m(p) = 3.3(2.1)(+3.8) M circle plus and m(p) = 8(6)(+11) M circle plus. The measured lens-source relative proper motion mu = 6 mas yr(-1) will permit imaging of the lens in about 15 years or at first light on adaptive-optics imagers on next-generation telescopes. These will allow one to measure the host mass but probably will not be able to resolve the planet-host mass-ratio degeneracy.

A New Adaptive Interaction Matrix Algorithm	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						instrumentation: adaptive optics; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: detection; stars: imaging	2 DEFORMABLE MIRRORS; 51 ERI B; CORONAGRAPH; MASK; ABERRATIONS	Future searches for bio-markers on habitable exoplanets will rely on telescope instruments that achieve extremely high contrast at small planet-to-star angular separations. Coronagraphy is a promising starlight suppression technique, providing excellent contrast and throughput for off-axis sources on clear apertures. However, the complexity of space-and ground-based telescope apertures goes on increasing over time, owing to the combination of primary mirror segmentation, the secondary mirror, and its support structures. These discontinuities in the telescope aperture limit the coronagraph performance. In this paper, we present ACAD-OSM, a novel active method to correct for the diffractive effects of aperture discontinuities in the final image plane of a coronagraph. Active methods use one or several deformable mirrors that are controlled with an interaction matrix to correct for the aberrations in the pupil. However, they are often limited by the amount of aberrations introduced by aperture discontinuities. This algorithm relies on the recalibration of the interaction matrix during the correction process to overcome this limitation. We first describe the ACAD-OSM technique and compare it to the previous active methods for the correction of aperture discontinuities. We then show its performance in terms of contrast and off-axis throughput for static aperture discontinuities (segmentation, struts) and for some aberrations evolving over the life of the instrument (residual phase aberrations, artifacts in the aperture, misalignments in the coronagraph design). This technique can now obtain the Earth-like planet detection threshold of 10(10) contrast on any given aperture over at least a 10% spectral bandwidth, with several coronagraph designs.

The planet's mass, M-p = 13.4 +/- 0.9 M-J, places it right at the deuteriumburning limit, i. e., the conventional boundary between "planets" and "brown dwarfs." Its existence raises the question of whether such objects are really " planets" (formed within the disks of their hosts) or "failed stars" (lowmass objects formed by gas fragmentation). This question may ultimately be addressed by comparing disk and bulge/bar planets, which is a goal of the Spitzer microlens program. The host is a G dwarf, M-host = 0.89. +/- 0.07 M-circle dot, and the planet has a semimajor axis a similar to 2.0 au. We use Kepler K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data to break the lens-mass degeneracy that generically impacts parallax solutions from Earth-Spitzer observations alone, which is the first successful application of this approach. The microlensing data, derived primarily from near-continuous, ultradense survey observations from OGLE, MOA, and three KMTNet telescopes, contain more orbital information than for any previous microlensing planet, but not quite enough to accurately specify the full orbit. However, these data do permit the first rigorous test of microlensing orbital-motion measurements, which are typically derived from data taken over < 1% of an orbital period.

The Complete Transmission Spectrum of WASP-39b with a Precise Water Constraint	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: individual (WASP-39b); techniques: spectroscopic	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; HD 189733B; EXOPLANET; INFERENCE; CLOUDS; PLANET; CLEAR	WASP-39b is a hot Saturn-mass exoplanet with a predicted clear atmosphere based on observations in the optical and infrared. Here, we complete the transmission spectrum of the atmosphere with observations in the near-infrared (NIR) over three water absorption features with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G102 (0.8-1.1 mu m) and G141 (1.1-1.7 mu m) spectroscopic grisms. We measure the predicted high-amplitude H2O feature centered at 1.4 mu m and the smaller amplitude features at 0.95 and 1.2 mu m, with a maximum water absorption amplitude of 2.4 planetary scale heights. We incorporate these new NIR measurements into previously published observational measurements to complete the transmission spectrum from 0.3 to 5 mu m. From these observed water features, combined with features in the optical and IR, we retrieve a well constrained temperature T-eq = 1030(20)(+30) K, and atmospheric metallicity 151(46) (+48) solar, which is relatively high with respect to the currently established mass-metallicity trends. This new measurement in the Saturn-mass range hints at further diversity in the planet formation process relative to our solar system giants.	[Wakeford, H. R.; Sing, D. K.; Goyal, J.; Wilson, T.

DES Collaboration	How Many Kilonovae Can Be Found in Past, Present, and Future Survey Data Sets?	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						stars: neutron	II SUPERNOVA SURVEY; SEARCH	The discovery of a kilonova (KN) associated with the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO)/Virgo event GW170817 opens up new avenues of multi-messenger astrophysics. Here, using realistic simulations, we provide estimates of the number of KNe that could be found in data from past, present, and future surveys without a gravitational-wave trigger. For the simulation, we construct a spectral time-series model based on the DES-GW multi-band light curve from the single known KN event, and we use an average of BNS rates from past studies of 103Gpc(-3) yr(-1), consistent with the one event found so far. Examining past and current data sets from transient surveys, the number of KNe we expect to find for ASAS-SN, SDSS, PS1, SNLS, DES, and SMT is between 0 and 0.3. We predict the number of detections per future survey to be 8.3 from ATLAS, 10.6 from ZTF, 5.5/69 from LSST (the Deep Drilling/Wide Fast Deep), and 16.0 from WFIRST. The maximum redshift of KNe discovered for each survey is z = 0.8 for WFIRST, z = 0.25 for LSST, and z = 0.04 for ZTF and ATLAS. This maximum redshift for WFIRST is well beyond the sensitivity of aLIGO and some future GW missions. For the LSST survey, we also provide contamination estimates from Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae: after light curve and template-matching requirements, we estimate a background of just two events. More broadly, we stress that future transient surveys should consider how to optimize their search strategies to improve their detection efficiency and to consider similar analyses for GW follow-up programs.

However, quantifying the sensitivity of wildfire to surface moisture state at seasonal lead-times has been challenging due to the absence of a long soil moisture record with the appropriate coverage and spatial resolution for continental-scale analysis. Here we apply model simulations of surface soil moisture that numerically assimilate observations from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with the USDA Forest Service's historical Fire-Occurrence Database over the contiguous United States. We quantify the relationships between pre-fire-season soil moisture and subsequent-year wildfire occurrence by land-cover type and produce annual probable wildfire occurrence and burned area maps at 0.25 degree resolution. Cross-validated results generally indicate a higher occurrence of smaller fires when months preceding fire season are wet, while larger fires are more frequent when soils are dry. This is consistent with the concept of increased fuel accumulation under wet conditions in the pre-season. These results demonstrate the fundamental strength of the relationship between soil moisture and fire activity at long lead-times and are indicative of that relationship's utility for the future development of national-scale predictive capability.

First version of the fiber injection unit for the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer	GROUND-BASED AND AIRBORNE INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Ground-Based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy VII	JUN 10-14, 2018	Austin, TX	SPIE, 4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment, Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel, Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst, Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies, Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Adaptive Optics; High contrast imaging; High resolution spectroscopy; Exoplanet characterization; Doppler imaging		Coupling a high-contrast imaging instrument to a high-resolution spectrograph has the potential to enable the most detailed characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, including spin measurements and Doppler mapping. The high-contrast imaging system serves as a spatial filter to separate the light from the star and the planet while the high-resolution spectrograph acts as a spectral filter, which differentiates between features in the stellar and planetary spectra. The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) located downstream from the current W. M. Keck II adaptive optics (AO) system will contain a fiber injection unit (FIU) combining a high-contrast imaging system and a fiber feed to Keck's high resolution infrared spectrograph NIRSPEC. Resolved thermal emission from known young giant exoplanets will be injected into a single-mode fiber linked to NIRSPEC, thereby allowing the spectral characterization of their atmospheres. Moreover, the resolution of NIRSPEC (R = 37,500 after upgrade) is high enough to enable spin measurements and Doppler imaging of atmospheric weather phenomenon. The module was integrated at Caltech and shipped to Hawaii at the beginning of 2018 and is currently undergoing characterization. Its transfer to Keck is planned in September and first on-sky tests sometime in December.	[Delorme, J.

It aims at addressing the technology gap for future exoplanet imagers and providing the U.S. community with an academic facility to test components and techniques for high contrast imaging, focusing on segmented apertures proposed for future ground-based (TMT, ELT) and space-based telescopes (HabEx, LUVOIR). We present an overview of the design of the instrument and a detailed look at the testbed build and initial alignment. We offer insights into stumbling blocks encountered along the path and show that the testbed is now operational and open for business. We aim to use the testbed in the future for testing of high contrast imaging techniques and technologies with amongst with thing, a TMT-like pupil.

After the VISIR upgrade in 2012, where coronagraphic masks were first added to VISIR, it became evident that coronagraphy at a ground-based 8m-class telescope, even at wavelengths as long as 10 mu m, critically needs adaptive optics. For VISIR, a work-horse observatory facility instrument in normal operations, this is "easiest" achieved by bringing VISIR as a visiting instrument to the ESO-VLT-UT4 having an adaptive M2. This "visit" enables a meaningful search for Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around both alpha-Cen(1) and alpha-Cen(2). Meaningful here means, achieving a contrast of approximate to 10(-6) within approximate to 0.8 arcsec from the star. Various measures to improve the sensitivity of VISIR will be applied, especially a dedicated filter, faster chopping and a Strehl-ratio close to 100% thanks to extreme adaptive optics. This should allow to detect a planet twice the diameter of Earth in 50 h on source integration time. Key components will be a diffractive coronagraphic mask, the annular groove phase mask (AGPM), optimized for the most sensitive spectral band-pass in the N-band, complemented by a sophisticated apodizer at the level of the Lyot stop. For VISIR noise filtering based on fast chopping is required. A novel internal chopper system will be integrated into the cryostat. This chopper is based on the standard technique from early radio astronomy, conceived by the microwave pioneer Robert Dicke in 1946, which was instrumental for the discovery of the 3K microwave background. For risk mitigation all components are being tested and quali fi ed under realistic conditions in the lab at ESO headquarters before integration into the instrument. The performance or suppression of the coronagraph is so good, that a non-thermal source (vulgo a laser) is needed on the test-bench. We will give an overview of the optical changes to VISIR, the implementation of wave front sensing, the Dicke switch design and laboratory testing, the AGPM design and laboratory testing, non common path error control with a ZELDA mask, sensitivity and contrast estimates, data flow and analysis, the overall project status, plan and outlook Needless to say that this project is of critical interest for future infrared instrumentation at the next generation of extremely large telescopes aiming at surveying the solar neighborhood for terrestrial planets by detecting and characterizing them based on their mid-IR fluxes.

Yet, these multiple systems are usually overlooked or discarded in most direct imaging surveys, as they prove difficult to image at high-contrast using coronographs. This is particularly the case for compact binaries (less than 1 '' angular separation) with similar stellar magnitudes, where no existing coronagraph can provide high-contrast regime. Here we present preliminary results of an on-going Palomar pilot survey searching for low-mass companions around similar to 15 young "challenging" binary systems, with angular separation as close as 0 '' 3 and near-equal K-band magnitudes. We use the Stellar Double Coronagraph (SDC) instrument on the 200-inch Telescope in a modified optical configuration, making it possible to align any targeted binary system behind two vector vortex coronagraphs in cascade. This approach is uniquely possible at Palomar, thanks to the absence of sky rotation combined with the availability of an extreme AO system, and the number of intermediate focal-planes provided by the SDC instrument. Finally, we expose our current data reduction strategy, and we attempt to quantify the exact contrast gain parameter space of our approach, based on our latest observing runs.

Designed to achieve a radial velocity precision of < 30 cm/s, NEID will be sensitive enough to detect terrestrial-mass exoplanets around low-mass stars. Light from the target stars is focused by the telescope to a bent Cassegrain port at the edge of the primary mirror mechanical support. The specialized NEID "Port Adapter" system is mounted at this bent Cassegrain port and is responsible for delivering the incident light from the telescope to the NEID fibers. In order to provide stable, high-quality images to the science instrument, the Port Adapter houses several sub-components designed to acquire the target stars, correct for atmospheric dispersion, stabilize the light onto the science fibers, and calibrate the spectrometer by injecting known wavelength sources such as a laser frequency comb. Here we provide an overview of the overall opto-mechanical design and system requirements of the Port Adapter. We also describe the development of system error budgets and test plans to meet those requirements.

This opens up a number of exciting new possibilities and efficiency gains for optical/IR astronomy. In this paper we describe a plan to take the MKID technology, which we have demonstrated on the Palomar, Lick, and Subaru Telescopes, out of the realm of private instruments usable only by experts. Our goal is to incorporate MKIDs into a facility-class instrument at the Keck 1 Telescope that can be used by a large part of the astronomical community. This new instrument, the Keck Radiometer Array using KID ENergy Sensors (KRAKENS), will be a 30 kpix integral field spectrograph (IFS) with a 42.5 '' x45 '' field of view, extraordinarily wide wavelength coverage from 380-1350 nm, and a spectral resolution R=lambda/Delta lambda > 20 at 400 nm. Future add on modules could enable polarimetry and higher spectral resolution. KRAKENS will be built using the same style MKID arrays, cryostat, and similar readout electronics to those used in the successful 10 kpix DARKNESS instrument at Palomar and 20 kpix MEC instrument at Subaru, significantly reducing the technical risk.

Though both telescopes are almost identical at a hardware and software level there are subtle differences. With the accrued knowledge from operations from both a software and hardware point of view we will be addressing the following subjects: Changes in software on the telescope control level to interface with the similar system at GN, changes in the user interface for both instrument operation, proposal management, and observation preparations by a PI. Adjustments and requirements to interface at a hardware level with cooling and power requirements, and changes in the hardware configuration of network interfaces. We also show the results from vibration measurements at both telescopes and these measurements indicate that the vibrations will not be an issues when moving from GS to GN. Using more than 600h of observations and performance measurements and weather conditions at GS, and correlating with several years of weather monitoring at Mauna Kea we show what improvements in performance we can expect. We expect a significant improvement in performance due to the less turbulent atmosphere at GN, with post-processed contrast improving by a factor of 1.3-2.6.

The Super-pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope (SuperBIT) is a wide-field imager designed to provide 0.02 '' image stability over a 0.5 degree field-of-view for deep exposures within the visible-to-near-UV (300-900 um). As such, SuperBIT is a suitable platform for a wide range of balloon-borne observations, including solar and extrasolar planetary spectroscopy as well as resolved stellar populations and distant galaxies. We report on the overall payload design and instrumentation methodologies for SuperBIT as well as telescope and image stability results from two test flights. Prospects for the SuperBIT project are outlined with an emphasis on the development of a fully operational, three-month science flight from New Zealand in 2020.	[Romualdez, L.

It is fiber fed and employs a classical white pupil Echelle configuration. NEID has a fiber aperture of only 0.92 '' on sky in high-resolution mode, and its tight radial velocity error budget resulted in very stringent stability requirements for the input illumination of the spectrograph optics. Consequently, the demands on the fiber injection are challenging. In this paper, we describe the layout and optical design of the injection module, including a broadband, high image quality relay and a high-performance atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) across the bandwidth of 380 - 930 nm.

Cold exoplanets emit the majority of their light in the thermal infrared, which means these exoplanets can be detected at a more modest contrast than at other wavelengths. PSI-Red will be able to detect and characterize a wide variety of exoplanets, including radial-velocity planets on wide orbits, accreting protoplanets in nearby star-forming regions, and reflected-light planets around the nearest stars. PSI-Red will feature an imager, a low-resolution lenslet integral field spectrograph, a medium-resolution lenslet+slicer integral field spectrograph, and a fiber-fed high-resolution spectrograph.

Exploiting the Subaru prime focus, 2394 reconfigurable fibers will be distributed over the 1.3 deg field of view. The spectrograph has been designed with 3 arms of blue, red, and near-infrared cameras to simultaneously observe spectra from 380nm to 1260nm in one exposure at a resolution of 1.6-2.7A. An international collaboration is developing this instrument under the initiative of Kavli IPMU. The project recently started undertaking the commissioning process of a subsystem at the Subaru Telescope side, with the integration and test processes of the other subsystems ongoing in parallel. We are aiming to start engineering night-sky operations in 2019, and observations for scientific use in 2021.

The instrument utilizes a novel polarimeter design based on a quarter-wave plate and a polarization grating (PG), which provides full linear polarization measurements (Stokes I, Q, and U) in one exposure with no need for a polarimetric modulator. The PG also has high transmission across the J and H bands. The instrument is situated at the prime focus of an equatorially mounted telescope. As a result, the system only has one reflection in the light path and the instrument does not rotate with respect to the sky, which provides minimal and stable telescope induced polarization. A data reduction pipeline has been developed for WIRC+Pol to produce linear polarization measurements from observations, allowing, e.g., real-time monitoring of the signal-to-noise ratio of ongoing observations. WIRC+Pol has been on-sky since February 2017. Results from the first year commissioning data show that the instrument has a high dispersion efficiency as expected from the polarization grating. We discuss instrumental systematics we have uncovered in the data, their potential causes, along with calibrations that are necessary to eliminate them. We demonstrate the polarimetric stability of the instrument with RMS variation at 0.2% level over 30 minutes for a bright standard star (J = 8.7). While the spectral extraction is photon noise limited, polarization calibration between sources remain limited by systematics.

The primary objective of the mission is to quantify at high spatio-temporal resolution crucial characteristics, processes and interactions between sea ice, and other Earth system components in order to advance the understanding and prediction of climate change and its impacts on the environment and society. The objective is articulated through three key questions. 1) In a rapidly changing Arctic regime and under the resilient Antarctic sea ice trend, how will highly dynamic forcings and couplings between the various components of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere modify or influence the processes governing the characteristics of the sea ice cover (ice production, growth, deformation, and melt)? 2) What are the impacts of extreme events and feedback mechanisms on sea ice evolution? 3) What are the effects of the cryosphere behaviors, either rapidly changing or resiliently stable, on the global oceanic and atmospheric circulation and mid-latitude extreme events? To contribute answering these questions, G-TERN will measure key parameters of the sea ice, the oceans, and the atmosphere with frequent and dense coverage over polar areas, becoming a "dynamic mapper" of the ice conditions, the ice production, and the loss in multiple time and space scales, and surrounding environment. Over polar areas, the G-DERN will measure sea ice surface elevation (<10 cm precision), roughness, and polarimetry aspects at 30-km resolution and 3-days full coverage. G-TERN will implement the interferometric GNSS reflectometry concept, from a single satellite in near-polar orbit with capability for 12 simultaneous observations. Unlike currently orbiting GNSS reflectometry missions, the G-TERN uses the full GNSS available bandwidth to improve its ranging measurements. The lifetime would be 2025-2030 or optimally 2025-2035, covering key stages of the transition toward a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer. This paper describes the mission objectives, it reviews its measurement techniques, summarizes the suggested implementation, and finally, it estimates the expected performance.

GCOM-W AMSR2 Soil Moisture Product Validation Using Core Validation Sites	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						In situ networks; passive microwave; soil moisture; validation	MICROWAVE EMISSION; ALGORITHM	The Advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is part of the global change observationmission-water (GCOM-W). AMSR2 has filled the gap in passive microwave observations left by the loss of the AMSR-earth observing system (AMSR-E) after almost ten years of observations. Both missions provide brightness temperature observations that are used to retrieve soil moisture estimates at the near surface. A merged AMSR-E and AMSR2 data product will help build a consistent long-term dataset; however, before this can be done, it is necessary to conduct a thorough validation and assessment of the AMSR2 soil moisture products. This study focuses on the validation of the AMSR2 soil moisture products by comparison with in situ reference data from a set of core validation sites around the world. A total of three soil moisture products that rely on different algorithms were evaluated; the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) soil moisture algorithm, the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM), and the single channel algorithm (SCA). JAXA, SCA, and LPRM soil moisture estimates capture the overall climatological features. The spatial features of the three products have similar overall spatial structure. The JAXA soil moisture product shows a lower dynamic range in the retrieved soil moisture with a satisfactory performance matrix when compared to in situ observations [unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) = 0.059 m(3)/m(3), Bias = -0.083 m(3)/m(3), R = 0.465]. The SCA performs well over low and moderately vegetated areas (ubRMSE = 0.053 m(3)/m(3), Bias=-0.039 m(3)/m(3), R = 0.549). The LPRM product has a large dynamic range compared to in situ observations with a wet bias (ubRMSE = 0.094 m(3)/m(3), Bias = 0.091 m(3)/m(3), R = 0.577). Some of the error is due to the difference in observation depth between the in situ sensors (5 cm) and satellite estimates (1 cm).

This has been especially beneficial for III-V semiconductor based infrared photodiodes, which traditionally tend to suffer from excess depletion dark current and the lack of good surface passivation. Advances in bulk and typeII superlattice infrared absorber materials have provided continuously adjustable cutoff wavelength span ranging from 2 to 14 mu m and beyond, greatly expanding the limited coverage provided by traditional bulk III-V infrared detectors based on InGaAs and InSb. In this work we discuss recent developments of antimonide-based extended-SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR detectors and focal plane arrays at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Factors Limiting Li+ Charge Transfer Kinetics in Li-ion Batteries	INNOVATIONS IN ARMY ENERGY AND POWER MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES	Materials Research Foundations		English	Article; Book Chapter						Lithium-Ion Charge Transfer Kinetics; Limiting Factor; De-Solvation; SEI; Lithium-Ion Batteries	LOW-TEMPERATURE; ELECTROLYTES; INTERFACE; CONDUCTIVITY; LIQUID; GRAPHITE; BEHAVIOR; FEPO4	Understanding the factors limiting Li+ charge transfer kinetics in Li-ion batteries is essential in improving the rate performance, especially at lower temperatures. The Li+ charge transfer process involved in the lithium intercalation of graphite anode includes the step of de-solvation of the solvated Li+ in the liquid electrolyte and the step of transport of Li+ in the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrodes until the Li+ accepts an electron at the electrode and becomes a Li in the electrode. Whether the de-solvation process or the Li+ transport through the SEI is a limiting step depends on the nature of the interphases at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Several examples involving the electrode materials such as graphite, lithium titanate (LTO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) and solid Li+ conductor such as lithium lanthanum titanate or Li-Al-Ti-phosphate are reviewed and discussed to clarify the conditions at which either the de-solvation or the transport of Li+ in SEI is dominating and how the electrolyte components affect the activation energy of Li+ charge transfer kinetics. How the electrolyte additives impact the Li+ charge transfer kinetics at both the anode and the cathode has been examined at the same time in 3-electrode full cells. The resulting impact on Li+ charge transfer resistance, Itc and activation energy, Ea, at both electrodes are reported and discussed.	[Jow, T.

Automated data processing architecture for the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						high contrast imaging; exoplanets; circumstellar disks; data processing; Gemini planet imager; Data Cruncher	PERFORMANCE; PHOTOMETRY; ASTROMETRY	The Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) is a multiyear direct imaging survey of 600 stars to discover and characterize young Jovian exoplanets and their environments. We have developed an automated data architecture to process and index all data related to the survey uniformly. An automated and flexible data processing framework, which we term the Data Cruncher, combines multiple data reduction pipelines (DRPs) together to process all spectroscopic, polarimetric, and calibration data taken with GPIES. With no human intervention, fully reduced and calibrated data products are available less than an hour after the data are taken to expedite follow up on potential objects of interest. The Data Cruncher can run on a supercomputer to reprocess all GPIES data in a single day as improvements are made to our DRPs. A backend MySQL database indexes all files, which are synced to the cloud, and a front-end web server allows for easy browsing of all files associated with GPIES. To help observers, quicklook displays show reduced data as they are processed in real time, and chatbots on Slack post observing information as well as reduced data products. Together, the GPIES automated data processing architecture reduces our workload, provides real-time data reduction, optimizes our observing strategy, and maintains a homogeneously reduced dataset to study planet occurrence and instrument performance.

Elucidating the Role of Anthropogenic Aerosols in Arctic Sea Ice Variations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							GREENHOUSE-GAS; POLAR AMPLIFICATION; CLIMATE MODELS; AIR-POLLUTION; REPRESENTATION; FEEDBACKS; EMISSIONS; RESPONSES	Observations show that the Arctic sea ice cover has been shrinking at an unprecedented rate since the 1970s. Even though the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been closely linked with the loss of Arctic sea ice, the role of atmospheric aerosols in past and future Arctic climate change remains elusive. Using a state-of-the-art fully coupled climate model, the authors assess the equilibrium responses of the Arctic sea ice to the different aerosol emission scenarios and investigate the pathways by which aerosols impose their influence in the Arctic. These sensitivity experiments show that the impacts of aerosol pertur-bations on the pace of sea ice melt effectively modulate the ocean circulation and atmospheric feedbacks. Because of the contrasting evolutions of particulate pollution in the developed and developing countries since the 1970s, the opposite aerosol forcings from different midlatitude regions are nearly canceled out in the Arctic during the boreal summer, resulting in a muted aerosol effect on the recent sea ice changes. Consequently, the greenhouse forcing alone can largely explain the observed Arctic sea ice loss up to the present. In the next few decades, the projected alleviation of particulate pollution in the Northern Hemisphere can contribute up to 20% of the total Arctic sea ice loss and 0.7 degrees C surface warming over the Arctic. The authors' model simulations further show that aerosol microphysical effects on the Arctic clouds are the major component in the total aerosol radiative forcing over the Arctic. Compared to the aerosol-induced energy imbalance in lower latitudes outside the Arctic, the local radiative forcing by aerosol variations within the Arctic, due to either local emissions or long-range transports, is more efficient in determining the sea ice changes and Arctic climate change.

This data set reveals the full Southern Ocean SSH seasonal cycle for the first time; there is an antiphase relationship between sea level on the Antarctic continental shelf and the deeper basins, with coastal SSH highest in autumn and lowest in spring. As a result of this pattern of seasonal SSH variability, the barotropic component of the Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) has speeds that are regionally up to twice as fast in the autumn. Month-to-month circulation variability of the Ross and Weddell Gyres is strongly influenced by the local wind field, and is correlated with the local wind curl (Ross: -0.58; Weddell: -0.67). SSH variability is linked to both the Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode, dominant modes of southern hemisphere climate variability. In particular, during the strong 2015-2016 El Nino, a sustained negative coastal SLA of up to -6 cm, implying a weakening of the ASC, was observed in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The ability to examine sea level variability in the seasonally ice-covered regions of the Southern Oceanclimatically important regions with an acute sparsity of datamakes this new merged sea level record of particular interest to the Southern Ocean oceanography and glaciology communities.

In contrast, on Mars, ejecta often form continuous, distinct, and sometimes thick deposits that transition to a low ridge or escarpment that may be circular or lobate. The Martian ejecta type has been variously termed pancake, rampart, lobate, or layered, and in this work we refer to it as abrupt termini ejecta (ATE). Two main formation mechanisms have been proposed, one requiring interaction of the ejecta with the atmosphere and the other mobilization of near-surface volatiles. ATE morphologies are also unambiguously seen on Ganymede, Europa, Dione, and Tethys, but they are not as common as on Mars. We have identified up to 38 craters on Charon that show signs of ATE, including possible distal ramparts and lobate margins. These ejecta show morphologic and morphometric similarities with other moons in the solar system, which are a subset of the properties observed on Mars. From comparison of these ejecta on Charon and other solar system bodies, we find the strongest support for subsurface volatile mobilization and ejecta fluidization as the main formation mechanism for the ATE, at least on airless, icy worlds. This conclusion comes from the bodies on which they are found, an apparent preference for certain terrains, and the observation that craters with ATE can be near to similarly sized craters that only have gradational ejecta.

Expected Seismicity and the Seismic Noise Environment of Europa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Europa; seismology; noise; seismicity	SUBSURFACE OCEAN; ICE SHELL; GALILEAN SATELLITES; SHALLOW MOONQUAKES; INTERNAL STRUCTURE; FREE OSCILLATIONS; RADAR DETECTION; SOLAR-SYSTEM; AUTOCORRELATION; DETECTABILITY	Seismic data will be a vital geophysical constraint on internal structure of Europa if we land instruments on the surface. Quantifying expected seismic activity on Europa both in terms of large, recognizable signals and ambient background noise is important for understanding dynamics of the moon, as well as interpretation of potential future data. Seismic energy sources will likely include cracking in the ice shell and turbulent motion in the oceans. We define a range of models of seismic activity in Europa's ice shell by assuming each model follows a Gutenberg-Richter relationship with varying parameters. A range of cumulative seismic moment release between 10(16) and 10(18)Nm/yr is defined by scaling tidal dissipation energy to tectonic events on the Earth's moon. Random catalogs are generated and used to create synthetic continuous noise records through numerical wave propagation in thermodynamically self-consistent models of the interior structure of Europa. Spectral characteristics of the noise are calculated by determining probabilistic power spectral densities of the synthetic records. While the range of seismicity models predicts noise levels that vary by 80dB, we show that most noise estimates are below the self-noise floor of high-frequency geophones but may be recorded by more sensitive instruments. The largest expected signals exceed background noise by approximate to 50dB. Noise records may allow for constraints on interior structure through autocorrelation. Models of seismic noise generated by pressure variations at the base of the ice shell due to turbulent motions in the subsurface ocean may also generate observable seismic noise. Plain Language Summary In this study, we are looking at sources that vibrate the outer ice shell of Europa and produce energy recorded by a seismometer. We are interested in this because seismology has been the best tool for determining the interior structure of the Earth; therefore, we want to consider how much energy we expect to go into seismic activity on Europa. In this study, we simulate long seismic recordings assuming that icequakes behave statistically similar to earthquakes. This predicts how frequently we expect events of different sizes. By scaling the total energy released observed on the Earth's moon by the much higher tidal energy available to Europa, we predict a range of simulated event catalogs. With those catalogs, we simulate the seismic waves recorded at a seismometer. This lets us determine how large events are likely to be, and also what the more or less continuous background noise from many small events will look like. We also examine a technique that can use an approach called autocorrelation to pull signals out of the noise, which in our simulated records show a clear energy arrival representing energy reflected from the ocean bottom. We conclude that a simple instrument does not have enough sensitivity to reliably record either the large signals or the background noise on Europa's surface, but a more sensitive instrument may record the background noise for periods shorter than 10s, as well as very likely recording signals from larger events expected to occur a few times per week of observation.

The interior density, temperature, sound speed, and electrical conductivity thus characterize their habitability. We explore the variability and correlation of these parameters using 1-D internal structure models. We invoke thermodynamic consistency using available thermodynamics of aqueous MgSO4, NaCl (as seawater), and NH3; pure water ice phases I, II, III, V, and VI; silicates; and any metallic core that may be present. Model results suggest, for Europa, that combinations of geophysical parameters might be used to distinguish an oxidized ocean dominated by MgSO4 from a more reduced ocean dominated by NaCl. In contrast with Jupiter's icy ocean moons, Titan and Enceladus have low-density rocky interiors, with minimal or no metallic core. The low-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals or anhydrous minerals with high porosity. Cassini gravity data for Titan indicate a high tidal potential Love number (k(2)>0.6), which requires a dense internal ocean ((ocean)>1,200kgm(-3)) and icy lithosphere thinner than 100km. In that case, Titan may have little or no high-pressure ice, or a surprisingly deep water-rock interface more than 500km below the surface, covered only by ice VI. Ganymede's water-rock interface is the deepest among known ocean worlds, at around 800km. Its ocean may contain multiple phases of high-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently salty. Callisto's interior structure may be intermediate to those of Titan and Europa, with a water-rock interface 250km below the surface covered by ice V but not ice VI. Plain Language Summary Seismometers, magnetometers, and other tools may be used in the future to glimpse the insides of ocean worlds-moons of Jupiter and Saturn that have lots of liquid water under their icy surfaces. These measurements could reveal whether water and rock interact to produce chemical conditions that on Earth support life, how much life such chemical activity might support, and how long that activity has persisted through time. The pressures and temperatures in these extraterrestrial oceans differ from those in Earth's oceans, so only just now are the needed tools and data becoming available to predict what future measurements might reveal. In this work, we investigated the interior structures of icy ocean worlds based on available informationmainly NASA's Galileo and Cassini missionsand used chemical data to test what ocean and rock compositions are possible. Our calculations make predictions for Saturn's moons: Titan should not have an iron core, and its ocean may contain little or no high-pressure ice. Fluids may flow through the whole of the rock core of Enceladus because Cassini gravity measurements seem to point to a porous interior. Geophysical investigations could test whether the ocean in Jupiter's moon Europa has a composition like Earth's or may instead by very acidic if water and rock have not interacted much. Our calculations predict that these two scenarios can create unique combinations of measurable properties that can be probed by future missions using seismology, magnetic field measurements, and other means.

With the exception of the Philae lander, all in situ extraterrestrial seismological effort to date was limited to other terrestrial planets. All have in common a rigid crust above a solid mantle. The coming years may see the installation of seismometers on Europa, Titan, and Enceladus, so it is necessary to adapt seismological concepts to the setting of worlds with global oceans covered in ice. Here we use waveform analyses to identify and classify wave types, developing a lexicon for icy ocean world seismology intended to be useful to both seismologists and planetary scientists. We use results from spectral-element simulations of broadband seismic wavefields to adapt seismological concepts to icy ocean worlds. We present a concise naming scheme for seismic waves and an overview of the features of the seismic wavefield on Europa, Titan, Ganymede, and Enceladus. In close connection with geophysical interior models, we analyze simulated seismic measurements of Europa and Titan that might be used to constrain geochemical parameters governing the habitability of a sub-ice ocean. Plain Language Summary Icy ocean worlds, like Europa or Titan harbor an ocean below a solid ice layer. This ocean may be habitable but is difficult to study from orbit. We demonstrated that surface-installed seismometers are able to measure ice thickness and ocean depth directly and help constrain ocean temperature and chemistry, which are both critical for potential habitability. This paper tries to bridge the gap between methods of seismology on Earth and potential icy moon seismology by adapting common concepts to this setting. Using seismic wavefield simulations on high-performance computers, we showcase a few tests for ice thickness, ocean depth, location of seismic events, and the existence of high-pressure ice layers below an ocean. The paper focuses on Europa and Titan, with a more general description of Ganymede and Enceladus. The seismic waveform databases are made available to the seismological and planetary community to allow other researchers to build their own studies on icy ocean world seismology.

Factors Limiting Li+ Charge Transfer Kinetics in Li-Ion Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LIFEPO4 PHASE-TRANSITION; LOW-TEMPERATURE; ELECTROLYTES; INTERFACE; CONDUCTIVITY; LIQUID; CELLS; DICARBONATE; PERFORMANCE; ADDITIVES	Understanding the factors limiting Li+ charge transfer kinetics in Li-ion batteries is essential in improving the rate performance, especially at lower temperatures. The Li+ charge transfer process involved in the lithium intercalation of graphite anode includes the step of de-solvation of the solvated Li+ in the liquid electrolyte and the step of transport of Li+ in the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrodes until the Li+ accepts an electron at the electrode and becomes a Li in the electrode. Whether the de-solvation process or the Li+ transport through the SEI is a limiting step depends on the nature of the interphases at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Several examples involving the electrode materials such as graphite, lithium titanate (LTO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) and solid Li+ conductor such as lithium lanthanum titanate or Li-Al-Ti-phosphate are reviewed and discussed to clarify the conditions at which either the de-solvation or the transport of Li+ in SEI is dominating and how the electrolyte components affect the activation energy of Li+ charge transfer kinetics. How the electrolyte additives impact the Li+ charge transfer kinetics at both the anode and the cathode has been examined at the same time in 3-electrode full cells.

The SAFARI Detector System	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		SAFARI; SPICA Transition Edge Sensor; Far-Infrared Spectrometer; Infrared Space Observatory; Frequency Domain Multiplexing; Far-Infrared Bolometer Array; Focal-Plane Array	READOUT; SPICA	We give an overview of the baseline detector system for SAFARI, the prime focal-plane instrument on board the proposed space infrared observatory, SPICA. SAFARI's detectors are based on superconducting Transition Edge Sensors (TES) to provide the extreme sensitivity (dark NEP <= 2x10(-19) W/v Hz) needed to take advantage of SPICA's cold (<8 K) telescope. In order to read out the total of similar to 3500 detectors we use frequency domain multiplexing (FDM) with baseband feedback. In each multiplexing channel, a two-stage SQUID preamplifier reads out 160 detectors. We describe the detector system and discuss some of the considerations that informed its design.

Ultra-Thin Large-Aperture Vacuum Windows for Millimeter Wavelengths Receivers	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Millimeter Wavelengths; Vacuum Windows; Polymer Materials; Cosmic Microwave Background; Primordial Gravitational Waves; Polarization; BICEP; Keck Array		Targeting faint polarization patterns arising from Primordial Gravitational Waves in the Cosmic Microwave Background requires excellent observational sensitivity. Optical elements in small aperture experiments such as Bicep3 and Keck Array are designed to optimize throughput and minimize losses from transmission, reflection and scattering at millimeter wavelengths. As aperture size increases, cryostat vacuum windows must withstand larger forces from atmospheric pressure and the solution has often led to a thicker window at the expense of larger transmission loss. We have identified a new candidate material for the fabrication of vacuum windows: with a tensile strength two orders of magnitude larger than previously used materials, woven high-modulus polyethylene could allow for dramatically thinner windows, and therefore significantly reduced losses and higher sensitivity. In these proceedings we investigate the suitability of high-modulus polyethylene windows for ground-based CMB experiments, such as current and future receivers in the Bicep/Keck Array program. This includes characterizing their optical transmission as well as their mechanical behavior under atmospheric pressure. We find that such ultra-thin materials are promising candidates to improve the performance of large-aperture instruments at millimeter wavelengths, and outline a plan for further tests ahead of a possible upcoming field deployment of such a science-grade window.

This experiment replaces the five Bicep2 style receivers that compose the Keck Array with four larger Bicep3 style receivers observing at six frequencies from 30 to 270GHz. The 95GHz and 150GHz receivers will continue to push the already deep Bicep/Keck CMB maps while the 30/40GHz and 220/270GHz receivers will constrain the synchrotron and galactic dust foregrounds respectively. Here we report on the design and performance of the Bicep Array instruments focusing on the mount and cryostat systems.

LSPE is a novel project that combines ground-based (STRIP) and balloon-borne (SWIPE) polarization measurements of the microwave sky on large angular scales to attempt a detection of the "B-modes" of the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization. STRIP will observe approximately 25% of the Northern sky from the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife, using an array of forty-nine coherent polarimeters at 43 GHz, coupled to a 1.5 m fully rotating crossed-Dragone telescope. A second frequency channel with six-elements at 95 GHz will be exploited as an atmospheric monitor. At present, most of the hardware of the STRIP instrument has been developed and tested at sub-system level. System-level characterization, starting in July 2018, will lead STRIP to be shipped and installed at the observation site within the end of the year. The on-site verification and calibration of the whole instrument will prepare STRIP for a 2-years campaign for the observation of the CMB polarization.

The CMOS ASIC spectrometer design, developed at JPL and UCLA, has dramatically lower power consumption than current approaches that generally employ Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Particularly for space missions and for small satellites, power consumption is a major issue. The order of magnitude lower power consumption of the ASIC approach is thus critical for future missions employing large-format focal plane arrays. Our task was to evaluate this 1024 channel, 1.3-GHz bandwidth CMOS spectrometer in terms of stability and filter shape. The chip was to be tested largely at half-maximum speed to allow for use of the polyphase filter bank. The results of this testing show that the ASIC spectrometer can be made to perform largely as expected based on its design parameters, however, they suggest that more testing of the spectrometer chip could be beneficial. Follow-up tests and newer versions of the chip are discussed at the end of the proceeding.

Currently, coherent Schottky receivers are far too large and consume too much power to be considered for deployment on any smaller forms of space-based satellites. Using an already existing design for a modular 520-600 GHz receiver designed at JPL, we have used novel packaging methods to condense this receiver into an integrated system. This integrated receiver has shown to have a volume and power consumption significantly smaller than the current state of the art. We will further present the designs of a similar integrated receiver for the first excited state of water vapor operating at the 1040-1200 GHz range. Finally, we discuss future plans for the combined mixer system and its potential for use in cubesat interferometry systems.

It is comprised of four 550 mm aperture refractive telescopes observing the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 30/40, 95, 150 and 220/270 GHz with over 30,000 detectors. We present an overview of the receiver, detailing the optics, thermal, mechanical, and magnetic shielding design. Bicep Array follows Bicep3 's modular focal plane concept, and upgrades to 6" wafer to reduce fabrication with higher detector count per module. The first receiver at 30/40GHz is expected to start observing at the South Pole during the 2019-20 season. By the end of the planned Bicep Array program, we project 0.002 less than or similar to sigma(r) less than or similar to 0.006, assuming current modeling of polarized Galactic foreground and depending on the level of delensing that can be achieved with higher resolution maps from the South Pole Telescope.

Bicep3's focal plane is populated with modularized tiles of antenna-coupled transition edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Bicep3 was deployed to the South Pole during 2014-15 austral summer and has been operational since. During the 2016-17 austral summer, we implemented changes to optical elements that lead to better noise performance. We discuss this upgrade and show the performance of Bicep3 at its full mapping speed from the 2017 and 2018 observing seasons. Bicep3 achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in mapping speed compared to a Keck 95GHz receiver. We demonstrate 6.6 mu K root s noise performance of the Bicep3 receiver.

A unique approach is employed in which curved gratings are used in parallel plate waveguides to focus and diffract broadband light from feed horns toward detector arrays. TIME will measure singly ionized carbon fluctuations from 5 < z < 9 with an imaging spectrometer. 32 independent spectrometers are assembled into two stacks of 16, one per polarization. Each grating has 210 facets and provides a resolving power R of similar to 200 over the 186-324 GHz frequency range. The dispersed light is detected using 2-D arrays of transition edge sensor bolometers. The instrument is housed in a closed-cycle 4K-1K-300mK cryostat. The spectrometers and detectors are cooled using a dual-stage 250/300 mK refrigerator.	[Li, Chao-Te; Wei, Tashun; Cheng, Jen-Chieh] Acad Sinica, Inst Astron & Astrophys, Taipei, Taiwan; [Bradford, C.

SuperSpec uses a lens and broadband antenna to couple radiation into a niobium microstrip that feeds a bank of niobium microstrip half-wave resonators for frequency selectivity. Each half-wave resonator is coupled to the inductor of a titanium nitride lumped-element kinetic inductance detector (LEKID) that detects the incident radiation. The device was designed for use in a demonstration instrument at the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT).	[Redford, J.; Hailey-Dunsheath, S.; Bradford, C.

Design and performance of wide-band corrugated walls for the BICEP Array detector modules at 30/40 GHz	MILLIMETER, SUBMILLIMETER, AND FAR-INFRARED DETECTORS AND INSTRUMENTATION FOR ASTRONOMY IX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Millimeter, Submillimeter, and Far-Infrared Detectors and Instrumentation for Astronomy IX	JUN 12-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipments Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		BICEP Array; Cosmic Microwave Background; Detector; Corrugations; Beam Systematic		BICEP Array is a degree-scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiment that will search for primordial B-mode polarization while constraining Galactic foregrounds. BICEP Array will be comprised of four receivers to cover a broad frequency range with channels at 30/40, 95, 150 and 220/270 GHz. The first low-frequency receiver will map synchrotron emission at 30 and 40 GHz and will deploy to the South Pole at the end of 2019. In this paper, we give an overview of the BICEP Array science and instrument, with a focus on the detector module. We designed corrugations in the metal frame of the module to suppress unwanted interactions with the antenna-coupled detectors that would otherwise deform the beams of edge pixels. This design reduces the residual beam systematics and temperature-to-polarization leakage due to beam steering and shape mismatch between polarized beam pairs. We report on the simulated performance of single-and wide-band corrugations designed to minimize these effects. Our optimized design alleviates beam differential ellipticity caused by the metal frame to about 7% over 57% bandwidth (25 to 45 GHz), which is close to the level due the bare antenna itself without a metal frame. Initial laboratory measurements are also presented.	[Soliman, A.; Aikin, R. W.; Bock, J. J.; Brevik, J. A.; Hildebrandt, S.

A CubeSat offers a cost-effective potential solution for observing these emissions, which cannot be observed from the ground, given it has a lens which can offer a significant effective collecting area at that frequency. To this end, we investigate designs for a lens by using transmission line theory to model a flat, lightweight, dielectrically embedded mesh lens which can be fabricated using layers of photolithographically etched material. We demonstrate that, using commercially available material, transmittances of over 95% may be achieved.

Galaxy bias from galaxy-galaxy lensing in the DES science verification data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: observations	COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER CONSTRAINTS; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; INTRINSIC ALIGNMENTS; DEEP SURVEY; NOISE BIAS; SHEAR; STATISTICS; CFHTLENS; SYSTEMATICS	We present a measurement of galaxy-galaxy lensing around a magnitude-limited (i(AB) < 22.5) sample of galaxies from the dark energy survey science verification (DES-SV) data. We split these lenses into three photometric-redshift bins from 0.2 to 0.8, and determine the product of the galaxy bias b and cross-correlation coefficient between the galaxy and dark matter overdensity fields r in each bin, using scales above 4 h(-1) Mpc comoving, where we find the linear bias model to be valid given our current uncertainties. We compare our galaxy bias results from galaxy-galaxy lensing with those obtained from galaxy clustering and CMB lensing for the same sample of galaxies, and find our measurements to be in good agreement with those in Crocce et al., while, in the lowest redshift bin (z similar to 0.3), they show some tension with the findings in Giannantonio et al. We measure b.r to be 0.87 +/- 0.11, 1.12 +/- 0.16 and 1.24 +/- 0.23, respectively, for the three redshift bins of width Delta z = 0.2 in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8, defined with the photometric-redshift algorithm BPZ. Using a different code to split the lens sample, TPZ, leads to changes in the measured biases at the 10-20 per cent level, but it does not alter the main conclusion of this work: when comparing with Crocce et al. we do not find strong evidence for a cross-correlation parameter significantly below one in this galaxy sample, except possibly at the lowest redshift bin (z similar to 0.3), where we find r = 0.71 +/- 0.11 when using TPZ, and 0.83 +/- 0.12 with BPZ.

Changes in Greenland's peripheral glaciers linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation	NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE			English	Article							MASS-BALANCE; ICE-SHEET; PRECIPITATION; FLUCTUATIONS; TIME	Glaciers and ice caps peripheral to the main Greenland Ice Sheet contribute markedly to sea-level rise(1-3). Their changes and variability, however, have been difficult to quantify on multi-decadal timescales due to an absence of long-term data(4). Here, using historical aerial surveys, expedition photographs, spy satellite imagery and new remote-sensing products, we map glacier length fluctuations of approximately 350 peripheral glaciers and ice caps in East and West Greenland since 1890. Peripheral glaciers are found to have recently undergone a widespread and significant retreat at rates of 12.2 m per year and 16.6 m per year in East and West Greenland, respectively; these changes are exceeded in severity only by the early twentieth century post-Little-Ice-Age retreat. Regional changes in ice volume, as reflected by glacier length, are further shown to be related to changes in precipitation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with a distinct east-west asymmetry; positive phases of the NAO increase accumulation, and thereby glacier growth, in the eastern periphery, whereas opposite effects are observed in the western periphery. Thus, with projected trends towards positive NAO in the future(5,6), eastern peripheral glaciers may remain relatively stable, while western peripheral glaciers will continue to diminish.	[Bjork, A.

The Dark Energy Survey and Operations: Years 4 and 5	OBSERVATORY OPERATIONS: STRATEGIES, PROCESSES, AND SYSTEMS VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Observatory Operations - Strategies, Processes, and Systems VII	JUN 11-15, 2018	Austin, TX	SPIE, 4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment, Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel, Inc, Harris Corp, Mater Corp, Optimax Syst, Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope		Cosmology; Dark Energy Survey; Dark Energy Camera; Operations; CTIO	COMPRESSION	The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an operating optical survey aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion of the universe using four complementary methods: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. To perform the 5000 sq-degree wide field and 30 sq-degree supernova surveys, the DES Collaboration built the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 3 square-degree, 570-Megapixel CCD camera that was installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). DES has completed its third observing season out of a nominal five. This paper describes DES "Year 4" (Y4) and "Year 5" (Y5), the survey strategy, an outline of the survey operations procedures, the efficiency of operations and the causes of lost observing time. It provides details about the quality of these two-season's data, a summary of the overall status, and plans for the final survey season.	[Diehl, H.

The combination of MIRI's sensitivity and angular resolution over the 5-28.5 mu m wavelength range will enable investigations into many different science topics, ranging from the local to the high-redshift Universe. The MIRI team has defined and published a set of "Recommended Strategies" to help observers optimally plan and execute their science programs. Some of these recommendations are generic and applicable to any science case; others are tailored to specific observing modes. Here we summarize key generic recommendations for MIRI observers, with emphasis on detector usage.

The project anticipated a maximum extended mission of about four years when the first mission extension was proposed. The robustness of the observatory hardware and the creativity of the project engineers and scientists in overcoming hurdles to operations has enabled a substantially longer mission lifetime. This has led to more challenges with an aging ground-system due to resource reductions and decisions made early in the extended mission based on a shorter planned lifetime. We provide an overview of the extended mission phases, challenges met in maintaining and enhancing the science productivity, and what we would have done differently if the extended mission was planned from the start to be nearly twice as long as the prime mission.

In particular, we discuss the possibility to use integrated optics, proven in the near-infrared, in the thermal near-infrared (L and M bands, 3-5 p.m) and advanced fringe tracking strategies. We also address the strong exoplanet science case (young exoplanets, planet formation, and exozodiacal disks) offered by this wavelength regime as well as other possible science cases such as stellar physics (fundamental parameters and multiplicity) and extragalactic astrophysics (active galactic nuclei and fundamental constants). Synergies and scientific preparation for other potential future instruments such as the Planet Formation Imager are also briefly discussed.	[Defrere, D.; Absil, O.; de Xivry, G.

Here, we will present an update on the work of the Science Working Group (SWG), including new simulations of dust structures during the assembly phase of planet formation and quantitative detection efficiencies for accreting and non-accreting young exoplanets as a function of mass and age. We use these results to motivate two reference PFI designs consisting of a) twelve 3m telescopes with a maximum baseline of 1.2 km focused on young exoplanet imaging and b) twelve 8 m telescopes optimized for a wider range of young exoplanets and protoplanetary disk imaging out to the 150 K H2O ice line. Armed with 4 x 8 m telescopes, the ESO/VLTI can already detect young exoplanets in principle and projects such as MATISSE, Hi-5 and Heimdallr are important PFI pathfinders to make this possible. We also discuss the state of technology development needed to make PFI more affordable, including progress towards new designs for inexpensive, small field-of-view, large aperture telescopes and prospects for Cubesat-based space interferometry.

Although successful discovery technologies are now populating exoplanetary catalogs into the thousands, contemporary astronomy is still poorly equipped to answer the basic question of whether there are any rocky planets orbiting any particular star system. Toliman will make a first study of stars within 10 PC of the sun by deploying an innovative optical and signal encoding architecture that leverages the most promising technology to deliver data on this critical stellar sample: high precision astrometric monitoring. Here we present results from the Foundational Mission Study, jointly funded by the Breakthrough Prize Foundation and the University of Sydney which has translated innovative underlying design principles into error budgets and potential spacecraft systems designs.

While originally focused on supporting NASA's planetary missions, the use of SPICE has slowly grown to include most worldwide planetary missions, and it has also been finding application in heliophysics and other space science disciplines. This paper peeks under the covers to see what new capabilities are being developed or planned at SPICE headquarters to better support the future of space science. The SPICE system is implemented and maintained by NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California (http://naifjpl.nasa.gov).

These two adjustments are designed to alleviate internal planar stresses that cause delamination between deposited layers and peeling off the substrate. Decreasing the distance between Ti interlayers helps to eliminate delamination between deposited layers. Through high speed camera measurements, the reaction propagation speed of an RMF sample with preheating is 42% slower than the same RMF that was not preheated, indicating a slower heat release rate. The preliminary experiments on brazing Ti-6Al-4V coated with BAlSi-4 brazing material revealed dendritic structure branching out from the RMF surface into the brazing material. The dendrite structures most likely form because of rapid melting and solidification of the brazing material. However, this rapid melting and solidification cycle does not appear to occur uniformly across the BAlSi-4RMF interface which is linked to its low bonding strength. When the Ti-6Al-4V substrate is heated to 150 degrees C prior to ignition, the strength increases to 0.47 MPa when the total RMF thickness is 84 mu m and 15 MPa of pressure is applied.

J	Rengarajan, SR; Hodges, RE				Rengarajan, Sembiam R.; Hodges, Richard E.			Accurate Evaluation of the Conductor Loss in Rectangular Microstrip Patch Reflectarrays	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M			English	Article								In the moment method solution of the integral equations for currents of a rectangular microstrip patch reflectarray, the Leontovich boundary condition is employed to determine the conductor loss. If the basis functions contain edge conditions that approach infinity, the moment matrix elements will have diverging integrals in the Galerkin technique. In this paper, we present a criterion to stop the evaluation of these integrals at a distance before the edge, thereby avoiding the divergence problem. The stopping distance derived here is found to work for a range of values of permittivity, loss tangent, and thickness of the substrate, polarization, angles of incidence of the plane wave source, and also for superstrates. Our computed results are in good agreement with measured results and those computed by HFSS.

The HSC Pipeline builds on the prototype pipeline being developed by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope's Data Management system, adding customizations for HSC, large-scale processing capabilities, and novel algorithms that have since been reincorporated into the LSST codebase. While designed primarily to reduce HSC Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) data, it is also the recommended pipeline for reducing general-observer HSC data. The HSC pipeline includes high-level processing steps that generate coadded images and science-ready catalogs as well as low-level detrending and image characterizations.

This yields a 15 sigma detection of the mean Planck cluster mass density profile. The five Planck clusters span a relatively wide mass range, M-WL,M-500c = (2-30) x 10(14) M-circle dot with a mean mass of M-WL,M-500c = (4.15 +/- 0.61) x 10(14) M-circle dot. The ratio of the stacked Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) mass to the stacked WL mass is < M-SZ > / < M-WL > = 1 - b = 0.80 +/- 0.14. This mass bias is consistent with previous WL mass calibrations of Planck clusters within the errors. We discuss the implications of our findings for the calibration of SZ cluster counts and the much discussed tension between Planck SZ cluster counts and Planck Lambda CDM cosmology.

The wide-field corrector delivers sharp images of 0.'' 2 (FWHM) in the HSC-i band over the entire 1.degrees 5 diameter field of view. The collimation of the camera with respect to the optical axis of the primary mirror is done with hexapod actuators, the mechanical accuracy of which is a few microns. Analysis of the remaining wavefront error in off-focus stellar images reveals that the collimation of the optical components meets design specifications. While there is a flexure of mechanical components, it also is within the design specification. As a result, the camera achieves its seeing-limited imaging on Maunakea during most of the time; the median seeing over several years of observing is 0.'' 67 (FWHM) in the i band. The sensors use p-channel, fully depleted CCDs of 200 mu m thickness (2048 x 4176 15 mu m square pixels) and we employ 116 of them to pave the 50 cm diameter focal plane. The minimum interval between exposures is 34 s, including the time to read out arrays, to transfer data to the control computer, and to save them to the hard drive. HSC on Subaru uniquely features a combination of a large aperture, a wide field of view, sharp images and a high sensitivity especially at longer wavelengths, which makes the HSC one of the most powerful observing facilities in the world.

Estimating surface soil moisture from SMAP observations using a Neural Network technique	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil moisture remote sensing; SMAP; Data assimilation; Microwave radiometer	CATCHMENT-BASED APPROACH; RETRIEVAL; MICROWAVE; SMOS; ASSIMILATION; VALIDATION; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; INFILTRATION; METHODOLOGY	A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2-3 day repeat frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.

Non-Gaussian tails of spectral response functions can be difficult to characterize in the laboratory, and calibration can shift during deployment. Consequently, in-flight techniques are useful for validating and updating laboratory measurements. Our approach exploits predictable changes in the shape of the oxygen A band across varying surface elevation, with diverse scene content providing numerical leverage to characterize spectral response tails 3-4 orders of magnitude below the peak. We present a correction to recover the nominal response function, and show case studies based on NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). Corrected radiances are better conditioned for downstream analysis by sensitive atmospheric codes. We evaluate accuracy using multiple independent standards: simulation studies; consistency with laboratory measurements; elimination of a surface pressure retrieval bias; better alignment of retrieved reflectance with ground reference data; and statistics of over 250 flightlines from a campaign across the Indian Subcontinent showing consistent improvements in atmospheric correction.

Development and assessment of the SMAP enhanced passive soil moisture product	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						SMAP; Enhanced; Soil moisture; Passive; Retrieval; Validation; Assessment	L-BAND; RADIOMETER DATA; PERFORMANCE; RETRIEVALS; VALIDATION	Launched in January 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory was designed to provide frequent global mapping of high-resolution soil moisture and freeze-thaw state every two to three days using a radar and a radiometer operating at L-band frequencies. Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones. Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017. This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid. This is made possible by first applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna temperature (T-A) data in the original SMAP Level 1B Brightness Temperature Product to take advantage of the overlapped radiometer footprints on orbit. The resulting interpolated TA data then go through various correction/calibration procedures to become the SMAP Level 1C Enhanced Brightness Temperature Product (L1C_TB_E). The L1C_TB_E product, posted on a 9 km grid, is then used as the primary input to the current operational SMAP baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm to produce L2_SM_P_E as the final output. Images of the new product reveal enhanced visual features that are not apparent in the standard product. Based on in situ data from core validation sites and sparse networks representing different seasons and biomes all over the world, comparisons between L2_SM_P_E and in situ data were performed for the duration of April 1, 2015-October 30, 2016. It was found that the performance of the enhanced 9 km L2_SM_P_E is equivalent to that of the standard 36 km L2_SM_P, attaining a retrieval uncertainty below 0.040 m(3)/m(3) unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and a correlation coefficient above 0.800. This assessment also affirmed that the Single Channel Algorithm using the V-polarized T-B channel (SCA-V) delivered the best retrieval performance among the various algorithms implemented for L2_SM_P_E, a result similar to a previous assessment for L2_SM_P.

We give a brief overview of these sensors and focus on the development and assessment of sounder data products, which include vertical profiles of temperature and water vapor, cloud and surface parameters, and in the case of infrared sounders also trace gas estimates and for microwave sounders precipitation as well. The baseline AIRS data product "retrieval system" was developed by the AIRS science team and has been undergoing continuous maintenance and upgrade in close collaboration with the sounder team at JPL. To support that process, the JPL team has developed a broad range of assessment tools and techniques, which can be applied to data from other sounders as well and can range from simple "sanity check" analysis to thorough "validation" analysis. An example of the less complex testing is the preliminary assessment of products generated by new retrieval systems operating on data from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) flying on the Suomi NPP and JPSS satellites. These retrieval systems are developed by individual investigators funded by NASA research grants and are delivered to a Sounder "Science Investigator Processing System" (SIPS) located at JPL for integration, testing and delivery to a NASA data processing center and eventual release to the public, but only limited resources are available to the SIPS for the assessment, which therefore must be relatively superficial. An example of thorough assessment is the quantification of the impact on AIRS products of the failure of the AMSU-A2 microwave sounder 2 years ago. The baseline AIRS retrieval system used initially data from the companion microwave sounders, the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB), AMSU-Al and AMSU-A2, to provide a "first guess" and support "cloud clearing". As these instruments suddenly failed (HSB) or gradually deteriorated (AMSU), some effort was devoted to develop a version that did not depend on microwave data. It was considered somewhat inferior to the baseline system and was kept in reserve and therefore not fully assessed. When AMSU-A2 failed, this AIRS-only system became the primary version, and a substantial effort was undertaken to fully assess its performance. We discuss details of that assessment. These capabilities have resulted from substantial investments NASA has made over the years in support of AIRS and can now be applied to next-generation systems as well.

They are: a) Instrument 1, wavelength centered at 756 nm for oxygen and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations, b) Instrument 2, centered at 1629 nm, for carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) observation, c) Instrument 3, centered at 2062 nm for carbon dioxide and d) Instrument 4, centered at 2328 for carbon monoxide (CO) and methane. From low-Earth orbit, these instruments have a field-of-view of 10 to 15 degrees, and a spatial resolution of 2 km square. These instruments have a spectral resolving power ranging from ten to twenty thousand, and can monitor column-average dry air mole fraction of carbon dioxide (XCO2) at 1.5 ppm, and methane (XCH4) at 7 ppb. These new instruments will advance the use of immersion grating technology in spectrometer instruments in order to reduce the size of the instrument, while improving performance. These compact, capable instruments are envisioned to be compatible with small satellites, yet modular to be configured to address the particular science questions at hand Here we report on the current status of the instrument design and fabrication, focusing primarily on Instruments 1 and 2. We will describe the key science and engineering requirements and the instrument performance error budget. We will discuss the optical design with particular emphasis on the immersion grating, and the advantages this new technology affords compared to previous instruments. We will also discuss the status of the focal plane array and the detector electronics and housing. Finally, we report on a new approach - developed during this instrument design process - which enables simultaneous measurement of both orthogonal polarization states (S and P) over the field-of-view and optical bandpass. We believe this polarization sensing capability will enable science observations which were previously limited by instrumental and observational degeneracies. In particular: improved sensitivity to all species, better sensitivity to surface polarization effects, better constraints on aerosol scattering parameters, and superior discrimination of the vertical distribution of gases and aerosols.

The long-term goal of our development would be to use small UAS to perform regional high resolution observation of two key hydrological measurements to improve the estimation of terrestrial water storage for water management, crop production and forecasts of natural hazard The UASHydro concept utilizes passive receivers to detect the reflection of strong existing P-band radio signals at the 360-380 MHz band from geostationary Mobile Use Objective System (MUOS) communication satellites launched by the US Navy. The SWE remote sensing measurement principle using the P-band SoOp is based on the propagation delay (or phase change) of radio signals through the snowpack. The time delay of the reflected signal due to the snowpack with respect to snow-free conditions is directly proportional to the snowpack SWE, while the soil moisture can be retrieved from the reflectivity at the P-band frequencies for MUOS. We have been conducting ground-based campaigns to test the instrumentation and data processing methods at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Colorado since February 2016. The field campaign data has provided support to the measurement concept. To install the SoOp technologies on the UAS, a lightweight antenna has been built and interfaces with the S2 built by Black Swift Technologies have been completed. A set of flights have been planned starting April 2018 through the end of 2018 in Colorado.

PFS will cover a 1.3-degree diameter field with 2394 fibers to complement the imaging capability of Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC). The Fiber Positioning System (FPS) is an automated system that controls the sequences for the operation of the PFS subsystems to achieve accurate positioning of the science fibers for astronomical observations. FPS will be operated continuously for 14 hours a night and accomplish the fiber positioning sequence every 15 minutes. The success rate of each alignment should be 95% or more and FPS should finish the fiber alignment procedure in 105 seconds. A fast centroid algorithm is implemented for measuring 2349 fiber spots within 1 second. In this report, the latest status of the development of FPS system will be given, including the system performance and closed-loop simulations.

SPHEREx has a simple, high-heritage design with large optical throughput to maximize spectral mapping speed. While the legacy data products will provide a rich archive of spectra for the entire astronomical community to mine, the instrument is optimized for three specific scientific goals: to probe inflation through the imprint primordial non-Gaussianity left on today's large-scale cosmological structure; to survey the Galactic plane for water and other biogenic ices through absorption line studies; and to constrain the history of galaxy formation through power spectra of background fluctuations as measured in deep regions near the ecliptic poles. The aluminum telescope consists of a heavily baffled, wide-field off-axis reflective triplet design. The focal plane is imaged simultaneously by two mosaics of H2RG detector arrays separated by a dichroic beamsplitter. SPHEREx assembles spectra through the use of mass and volume efficient linear variable filters (LVFs) included in the focal plane assemblies, eliminating the need for any dispersive or moving elements. Instead, spectra are constructed through a series of small steps in the spacecraft attitude across the sky, modulating the location of an object within the FOV and varying the observation wavelength in each exposure. The spectra will cover the wavelength range between 0.75 and 5.0 mu m at spectral resolutions ranging between R=35 and R=130. The entire telescope is cooled passively by a series of three V-groove radiators below 80K. An additional stage of radiative cooling is included to reduce the long wavelength focal plane temperature below 60K, controlling the dark current. As a whole, SPHEREx requires no new technologies and carries large technical and resource margins on every aspect of the design.

Imprinted by the history of stellar emission, the EBL in the near infrared traces light back to the birth of the first stars in the Universe and can allow tight constraints on structure formation models. Recent studies using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the first Cosmic Infrared Background ExpeRiment (CIBER-1) find that there are excess fluctuations in the EBL on large scales which have been attributed to either high redshift galaxies and quasars, or to stars that were stripped from their host galaxies during merging events. To help disentangle these two models, multi-wavelength data can be used to trace their distinctive spectral features. Following the success of CIBER-1, CIBER-2 is designed to identify the sources of the EBL excess fluctuations using data in six wavebands covering the optical and near infrared. The experiment consists of a cryogenic payload and is scheduled to launch four times on a recoverable sounding rocket. CIBER-2 has a 28.5 cm telescope coupled with an optics system to obtain wide-field images in six broad spectral bands between 0.5 and 2.5 mu m simultaneously. The experiment uses 2048 x 2048 HAWAII-2RG detector arrays and a cryogenic star tracker. A prototype of the cryogenic star tracker is under construction for a separate launch to verify its performance and star tracking algorithm. The mechanical, optical, and electrical components of the CIBER-2 experiment will have been integrated into the payload by mid-2018. Here we present the final design of CIBER-2 and our team's instrument characterization efforts. The design and analysis of the optical focus tests will be discussed. We also report on the performance of CIBER-2 support systems, including the cooling mechanisms and deployable components. Finally, we outline the remaining tasks required to prepare the payload for launch.

PICO would have multiple frequency bands between 21 and 799 GHz, and would survey the entire sky, producing maps of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation, of galactic dust, of synchrotron radiation, and of various populations of point sources. Several instrument configurations, optical systems, cooling architectures, and detector and readout technologies have been and continue to be considered in the development of the mission concept. We will present a snapshot of the baseline mission concept currently under development.

Although there have been failures and degraded instrument performance due to contamination, contamination control methods have been largely successful to date. However, due to improvements in technology and the desire for more sensitive science measurements, spacecraft are no longer clean enough to meet more stringent contamination requirements. New contamination control engineering methods will require institutional investments. As a first step toward identifying appropriate areas for these investments, a "brainstorming" exercise is performed addressing some of the more important areas where improvements are needed.

The approach taken to meet this requirement is to identify and model for each Mars 2020 mission phase the TOC sources, model TOC transport from sources to sample contacting surfaces, and combine them into an end-to-end model that calculates the TOC in each sample during the mission. The calculations show that Mars 2020 can achieve the TOC sample cleanliness requirement because the project has adopted specific TOC mitigations strategies.

One approach to answering that question could be a very compact, lightweight and robust microscope that is capable of rapidly imaging the contents of a 3-dimensional sample volume. To this end, we have been developing deployable digital holographic microscopes, which can also be used in the short term for terrestrial field work. A very stable "common-mode" microscope, in which two adjacent beams share several optics, has shown very good imaging performance, and has been deployed successfully to several field sites, including Greenland and Alaska. A more compact approach is our version of the lensless digital holographic microscope, which uses gradient index rod lenses to produce a pair of high numerical-aperture input beams. Sub-micron resolution has been obtained with both systems, and further performance improvements are possible.

In this paper, we focus on the modeling and characterization of pliable materials such as tall vegetation. These materials are of interest because they are pervasive in the real world, requiring the robotic vehicle to determine when to traverse or avoid them. This paper develops and experimentally verifies a template model for vegetation stems. In addition, it presents a methodology to generate predictions of the associated energetic cost incurred by a tracked mobile robot when traversing a vegetation patch of variable density.

Like with all space-borne instruments, payload size, weight, and power are critically restricted by the launch vehicle capacity and available solar power. A custom integrated circuit (IC) approach naturally prevails over FPGA-based discrete solutions in these areas. Rather than concocting a system out of circuitries intended for different applications, as in [2], each component in this work is optimized along the operating principle of radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy. Running at 2.6 GHz, the presented spectrometer features a three-bit flash ADC, an 8192-point polyphase filter bank (PFB), a 2048-point FFT processor, and a billion-count accumulator (ACC), all running off clocks derived from an integrated phase locked loop (PLL). The entire system consumes a peak power of 650 mW. It achieves the highest level of integration and best efficiency among current spectrometer solutions, and serves as the baseline component for upcoming NASA astrophysics spectroscopy missions.

A thorough investigation into the lack of robustness of the narrowband algorithm has now shown that this results from systematic errors (similar to 20 nm on average) that are wavelength-dependent. We show that the seemingly continuous distribution of these chromatic errors in fact results from (at least) two independent causes. The largest and most problematic effects are due to "plateaus" of unremoved material that were covered by supports during the ion beam figuring of three of the segments, but other smaller chromatic effects are also shown to be present and these are not yet understood. If the purely chromatic effects can be eliminated, we show that the intrinsic accuracy of the narrowband algorithm is about 6 nm (surface).

Radiation and conduction are the predominant heat transfer mechanisms with convection effects being minimal and difficult to characterize at 35-40 km. This greatly constrains the thermal design options and makes predicting flight thermal behaviour very difficult. Due to the limited power available on long duration balloon flights, efficient heater control is an important factor in minimizing power consumption. SuperBIT, or the Super-pressure Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope, aims to study weak gravitational lensing using a 0.5m modified Dall-Kirkham telescope capable of achieving 0.02 '' stability(1) and capturing deep exposures from visible to near UV wavelengths. To achieve the theoretical stratospheric diffraction-limited resolution of 0.25 '',(2) mirror deformation gradients must be kept to within 20 nm. The thermal environment must be stable on time scales of an hour and the thermal gradients on the telescope must be minimized. During its 2018 test-flight, SuperBIT will implement two types of thermal parameter solvers: one for post-flight characterization and one for in-flight control. The payload has 85 thermistors as well as pyranometers and far-infrared sensors which will be used post-flight to further understand heat transfer in the stratosphere. This document describes the in-flight thermal control method, which predicts the thermal circuit of components and then auto-tunes the heater PID gains. Preliminary ground testing shows the ability to control the components to within 0.01 K.	[Redmond, Susan; Damaren, Christopher J.; Romualdez, L.

Interferometric Characterization of Keck Segment Edge Errors	GROUND-BASED AND AIRBORNE TELESCOPES VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Ground-based and Airborne Telescopes VII	JUN 10-15, 2018	Austin, TX	4D Technol, Andor Technol Ltd, Astron Consultants & Equipment Inc, Giant Magellan Telescope, GPixel Inc, Harris Corp, Materion Corp, Optimax Syst Inc, Princeton Infrared Technologies, Symetrie, Teledyne Technologies Inc, Thirty Meter Telescope, SPIE		Telescopes; Segmented Mirrors; Optical Alignment; Phasing	MIRROR SEGMENTS; TELESCOPES	The Keck telescope segments were manufactured by stressed mirror polishing of large circular pieces of Zerodur that were then cut into hexagons and finished by Ion Beam Figuring (IBF). It has long been believed that this process results in segments with little or no edge effects. As a result, this same general approach is planned for segment manufacturing for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). However, recent measurements at the Keck telescope suggest that at least some of the Keck segments have significant aberrations within 60 mm of the edge. These aberrations impact the telescope phasing and the overall telescope image quality. We present interferometric measurements of multiple Keck segments, characterizing the surface errors near the edges over spatial periods from similar to 5 cm down to similar to 1 mm. We show that the largest phasing and image quality effects are due to plateaus of unremoved material, left behind after IBF as a result of obscuration by the IBF supports. Apart from these plateaus, the edge quality is relatively good, though not as good as in the segment interiors. Some residual phasing and image quality effects remain, and these are not currently understood.

Teledyne has successfully completed the fabrication, testing, and delivery of 24 science-grade flight candidate SCAs to the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). These SCAs were made with Teledyne's TRL-9 substrate-removed MBE mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) 2.3 mu m cutoff detector material and low-noise H2RG CMOS readout chip. The SCAs are mounted on a buttable molybdenum package that enables close packing of the 16 flight SCAs in the NISP focal plane. In this paper, we present the test results of the 24 Euclid flight candidate SCAs. The key detector performance parameters that are critical to the NISP instrument are: high in-band quantum efficiency with good spatial uniformity, low readout noise, low dark current with tight distribution, low pixel crosstalk, low persistence, and good detector surface metrology profile. All 24 SCAs exceed the Euclid NISP performance and interface requirements. The additional acceptance testing at JPL and NASA Goddard's Detector Characterization Lab has also been completed. 20 flight SCAs have been delivered to European Space Agency (ESA).

Here we present a scene generator that fulfills many of these functions. Based on a modern smartphone, it has a number of good features, including high spatial resolution (13 um), high dynamic range (similar to 10(4)), near-Poisson limited illumination stability over time periods from 100 ms to many days, and no background noise. The system does not require any moving parts and may be constructed at modest cost. We present the optical, mechanical, and software design, test data validating the performance, and application examples.

The light incident on the detector from these distant exoplanets is estimated to be on the order of a few photons per pixel per hour. To measure such small signals, the project has baselined the CCD201 detector made by e2v, a low-noise and high-efficiency electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), and has instituted a rigorous test and modeling program to characterize the device prior to flight. An important consideration is detector performance degradation over the proposed mission lifetime due to radiation exposure in space. To quantify this estimated loss in performance, the project has built a detector trap model that takes into account detailed trap interactions at the sub-pixel level, including stochastic trap capture and release, and the deferment of charge into subsequent pixels during parallel and serial clocking of the pseudo-two-phase CCD201 device. This paper describes recent detector trap model improvements and modeling results.

SPARCS is a 6U cubesat designed to monitor M stars (0.1 - 0.6 solar masses) in two photometric bands in the near UV and far UV (S-NUV, 260-300 nm; S-FUV, 150-170 nm). SPARCS targets range in mass and age, including young stars (10-20 Myr), which are likely forming terrestrial planets, to old stars with known transiting planets, allowing us to map the evolution of UV emission and flare rates. The spectral slope, variability and evolution of a host star's high-energy radiation would provide realistic input stellar fluxes to planet atmospheric models, which would aide in understanding the evolution and habitability of a planet and in interpreting its transmission and emission spectrum. The baseline S-NUV detector is a 2D-doped (delta-doped or superlattice-doped) charge coupled device (CCD) optimized with a custom antireflection (AR) coating to achieve quantum efficiency (QE)>70% throughout the S-NUV band. The S-NUV detector would be coupled with a stand-alone red-blocking filter that provides at least three orders of magnitude (i.e., >= OD3) out-of-band suppression, critical for the observations of such cool, red stars. Their combined throughput would be >25% (peak) in the S-NUV. The baseline S-FUV detector is a 2D-doped CCD optimized for the S-FUV band; it includes an integrated filter designed to maximize in-band throughput with good red-leak suppression. As designed, the solar-blind silicon detector achieves peak QE>35% in the S-FUV band and >= OD2 out-of-band suppression. SPARCS has baselined a dichroic design that allows for simultaneous S-NUV and S-FUV observation. SPARCS would advance 2D-doped detectors and detector-integrated out-of-band-rejection filter technologies for their potential application in future mission concepts such as LUVOIR and HabEx.

It is a fixed pattern of high frequency QE variations along 3 directions generally thought to be related to the crystal structure of HgCdTe. The pattern is evident in detectors used in WFC3/IR, WISE, JWST, and in candidate detectors for Euclid and WFIRST. Using undersampled point sources projected onto a HAWAII-2RG detector, we show that the pattern induces photometric variations that are not removed by a flat-field calibration, thus demonstrating that the QE variations occur on scales smaller than the 18 micron pixels. Our testbed is the Precision Projector Laboratory's astronomical scene generator, which can rapidly characterize the full detector by scanning thousands of undersampled spots. If not properly calibrated, detectors showing strong crosshatch may induce correlated errors in photometry, astrometry, spectroscopy, and shape measurements.

Furthermore, CGI will serve as a path finder for future exo-Earth imaging and characterization missions by demonstrating wavefront control, coronagraphy, and spectral retrieval in a new contrast regime, and by validating instrument and telescope models at unprecedented levels of precision. To achieve this jump in performance, it is critical to draw on the experience of ground-based high-contrast facilities. We discuss several areas of relevant commonalities, including: wavefront control, post-processing of integral field unit data, and calibration and observing strategies.

The Phase-Induced Amplitude Apodization Complex Mask Coronagraph (PIAACMC) is an attractive coronagraph option for the next generation of large space telescopes optimized for habitable exoplanet imaging: PIAACMC offers high throughput, small inner working angle (IWA) with little loss in image quality. PIAACMC is also compatible with segmented apertures, preserving much of the throughput and resolution of a full pupil. Coronagraph compatibility with segmented apertures is essential for the success of habitable planet characterization with future large apertures, such as the Large UV /Optical/Infrared (LUVOIR) concept currently under way to inform the 2020 decadal survey. We present a design of PIAACMC for a segmented aperture, using the segmented aperture currently considered for LUVOIR as a representative case. This design is optimized to be resilient to tip/tilt jitter and large stellar angular sizes. This also enables it to have improved tolerance to polarization-specific aberrations, which are dominated by low-order modes such as tip-tilt and astigmatism. We simulate and study the performance of this design using a simplified instrument model. These simulations include wavefront control and tip-tilt errors. We characterize the performance of our design in monochromatic as well as broadband light in terms of throughput, inner working angle, contrast, area of the dark zone, and sensitivity to low-order aberrations.

The finding of rocky planets in temperate orbits among our immediate stellar neighbors will be a signature discovery. Our mission will deliver relative measurements of stellar position and motion at sub-micro arcsecond precision. These data, in turn, will reveal the presence of orbiting exoplanets. For the case of our primary targets Alpha Centauri A & B, objects below one Earth mass will be accessible when the end-of-mission astrometric precision requirement of 0.4 micro arcsecond is achieved. TOLIMAN will directly reveal the presence of sub-earth mass planets and constrain it orbit and mass This paper describes the optical and mechanical architecture of the mission, and first order instrument design. We also explain the instrument stability requirements imposed by the diffractive pupil post-processing calibration limitations. Our design baseline is a stable two-mirror telescope that images the field directly on CCD camera minimizing the number of reflections and optical components.

Six wideband grating modules combine to cover the full band at R=300, each couples a long slit with 60-190 beams on the sky. OSS will have a total of 120,000 background-limited detector pixels in the six 2-D arrays which provide spatial and spectral coverage. The suite of grating modules can be used for pointed observations of targets of interest, and are particularly powerful for 3-D spectral spectral surveys. To chart the transition from interstellar material, particularly water, to planetary systems, two high-spectral-resolution modes are included. The first incorporates a Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) in front of the gratings providing resolving power of 25,000 (delta v = 12 km/s) at 179 mu m to resolve water emission in protoplanetary disk spectra. The second boosts the FTS capability with an additional etalon (Fabry-Perot interferometer) to provide 2 km/s resolution in this line to enable detailed structural studies of disks in the various water and HD lines. Optical, thermal, and mechanical designs are presented, and the system approach to the detector readout enabling the large formats is described.	[Bradford, C.

High-dispersion coronagraphy (HDC) may allow detection and characterization to be done simultaneously, as well as relax the starlight suppression requirements of the telescope and coronagraph. However, similar to other direct imaging techniques, HDC faces challenging thermal and/or exozodiacal background levels. In this paper, we present simulations of coronagraphic observations using a variety of space telescope apertures ranging in diameter from 1 to 15 m, specifically incorporating thermal and exozodiacal background. We investigate the effects of instrument temperature and aperture on the maximum usable wavelength, as well as the effects of exozodiacal disk inclination and thickness on observational SNR. We then identify the spectral resolutions which maximize observational SNR subject to detector noise and the required starlight suppression levels for the detection of various potential biomarker molecules (H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4).

Previous studies have investigated the effects of the inter-DM Fresnel number on achievable contrast, throughput, and tip/tilt sensitivity for apodized coronagraphs augmented with DMs to suppress diffraction from struts and segment gaps. In this paper, we build upon that previous work by directly suppressing tip/tilt sensitivity with the controller, both for coronagraphs with and without apodizers. We also explore the effects of other important design parameters such as actuator density and tip/tilt controller weighting on performance. These comprehensive coronagraph design studies are enabled by the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO) software toolbox, which provides rapid re-calculation of the DM response matrix for a variety of coronagraphs.

It is made of a 1.5-m Ritchey-Chretien telescope with a field of view of solid angle 0.4 deg(2). The wavelength range is at least 1 mu m to 4 mu m with a goal of 0.9 mu m to 5 mu m. Average resolution is 600 but with a possible trade-off to get 1000 at the longer wavelengths. The ATLAS Probe instrument is made of 4 identical spectrographs each using a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) as a multi-object mask. It builds on the work done for the ESA SPACE and Phase-A EUCLID projects. Three-mirror fore-optics re-image each sub-field on its DMD which has 2048 x 1080 mirrors 13.6 mu m wide with 2 possible tilts, one sending light to the spectrograph, the other to a light dump. The ATLAS Probe spectrographs use prisms as dispersive elements because of their higher and more uniform transmission, their larger bandwidth, and the ability to control the resolution slope with the choice of glasses. Each spectrograph has 2 cameras. While the collimator is made of 4 mirrors, each camera is made of only one mirror which reduces the total number of optics. All mirrors are aspheric but with a relatively small P-V with respect to their best fit sphere making them easily manufacturable. For imaging, a simple mirror to replace the prism is not an option because the aberrations are globally corrected by the collimator and camera together which gives large aberrations when the mirror is inserted. An achromatic grism is used instead. There are many variations of the design that permit very different packaging of the optics. ATLAS Probe will enable ground-breaking science in all areas of astrophysics. It will (1) revolutionize galaxy evolution studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from the local group to cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionization through the peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) open a new window into the dark universe by mapping the dark matter filaments to unveil the nature of the dark Universe using 3D weak lensing with spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy and modification of gravity using cosmic large-scale structure; (3) probe the Milky Way's dust-shrouded regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and (4) characterize asteroids and other objects in the outer solar systems.

We executed the HOSTS (Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems) survey to determine the typical amount of such exozodiacal dust around a sample of nearby main sequence stars. The majority of the data have been analyzed and we present here an update of our ongoing work. Nulling interferometry in N band was used to suppress the bright stellar light and to detect faint, extended circumstellar dust emission. We present an overview of the latest results from our ongoing work. We find seven new N band excesses in addition to the high confidence confirmation of three that were previously known. We find the first detections around Sun-like stars and around stars without previously known circumstellar dust. Our overall detection rate is 23%. The inferred occurrence rate is comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decreases from 71(-20)(+11) % for stars with previously detected mid- to far-infrared excess to 11(-4)(+9) % for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at high confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal luminosity function of the dust, we find upper limits on the median dust level around all stars without previously known mid to far infrared excess of 11.5 zodis at 95% confidence level. The corresponding upper limit for Sun-like stars is 16 zodis. An LBTI vetted target list of Sun-like stars for exo-Earth imaging would have a corresponding limit of 7.5 zodis. We provide important new insights into the occurrence rate and typical levels of habitable zone dust around main sequence stars. Exploiting the full range of capabilities of the LBTI provides a critical opportunity for the detailed characterization of a sample of exozodiacal dust disks to understand the origin, distribution, and properties of the dust.

Furthering our knowledge of galaxy formation requires uniform surveys of star-forming galaxies over a large range of redshifts and environments to accurately describe star formation, supermassive black hole growth, and interactions between these processes in galaxies. The GEP design includes a 2 m diameter SiC telescope actively cooled to 4 K and two instruments: (1) An imager to detect star-forming galaxies and measure their redshifts photometrically using emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It will cover wavelengths from 10 to 400 mu m, with 23 spectral resolution R = 8 filter-defined bands from 10 to 95 mu m and five R = 3.5 bands from 95 to 400 mu m. (2) A 24 - 193 mu m, R = 200 dispersive spectrometer for redshift confirmation, identification of active galactic nuclei, and interstellar astrophysics using atomic fine-structure lines. The GEP will observe from a Sun-Earth L2 orbit, with a design lifetime of four years, devoted first to galaxy surveys with the imager and second to follow-up spectroscopy. The focal planes of the imager and the spectrometer will utilize KIDs, with the spectrometer comprised of four slit-coupled diffraction gratings feeding the KIDs. Cooling for the telescope, optics, and KID amplifiers will be provided by solar-powered cryocoolers, with a multi-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator providing 100 mK cooling for the KIDs.

Apart from providing direct access to a number of significant bio-signatures, direct-imaging in the mid-infrared can provide 1000 times or more relaxation to contrast requirements while greatly shortening the time-scales over which the system must be stable. This in turn enables tremendous relief to optical manufacturing, control and stability tolerances bringing them inline with current technology state of the art. In this paper, we explore a reference design that co-optimizes a large, segmented, linearized aperture telescope using one-dimensional phase-induced aperture apodization to provide high-contrast imaging for spectroscopic analysis. By rotating about a parent star, the chemical signatures of its planets are characterized while affording additional means for background suppression.

The Atacama Large Millimeter Array has produced stunning images from the ground of planetary systems in the process of formation but cannot observe the key molecules of water or O-2, due to the presence of Earth's atmosphere. The concept presented here will enable interferometric imaging with sub-arcsecond resolution of water and other key far infrared molecular species from space at a cost far lower than the flagship class interferometric missions previously proposed (i.e. ESA's ESPRIT). We present a concept for a far infrared interferometer based on a constellation of CubeSat antenna elements with a central ESPA-class correlator satellite optimized for the imaging of water in protoplanetary systems. Such a mission would produce groundbreaking images of newly forming planetary systems in a key astrophysical and astrobiological tracer, the 557 GHz ground state line of water. By leveraging recent developments in CubeSat technology, inflatable reflectors, miniaturized receiver systems and low power CMOS digital electronics, such a mission could be implemented at an Explorer level budget. In addition to the proposed astrophysics application, the developments proposed here could also find application in planetary science (FIR spectroscopy of comets and small bodies) and Earth observing (high resolution imaging of Earth from geostationary orbit).

Two key aspects to advancing starshade technology are the demonstration of starlight suppression at science-enabling levels and validation of optical models at this high level of suppression. These technologies are addressed in current efforts underway at the Princeton Starshade Testbed. Recent experimental data suggest we are observing the effects of vector (non-scalar) diffraction, which are limiting the starshade's performance and preventing the scalar optical models from agreeing with experimental results at the deepest levels of suppression. This report outlines a model developed to simulate vector diffraction in the testbed using a full solution to Maxwell's equations propagating through narrow features of the starshade. We find that experimental results can be explained by vector diffraction as light traverses the thickness of the starshade mask and that our model is in rough agreement with observations. We provide simulation results of a number of starshade geometries as a first attempt to understand the relation of these effects to properties of the starshade masks. Finally, we outline a number of possible solutions aimed to minimize vector effects and to allow us to reach our milestone of 10(-9) suppression.	[Harness, Anthony; Kasdin, N.

For Guaranteed Time and Early Release Science Observations, over 500 hours of JWST time have been allocated to time series observations (TSOs) of transiting exoplanets. Several dedicated observing modes are available in the instrument suite, whose operations are specifically tailored to these challenging observations. MIRI, the only JWST instrument covering the wavelength range longwards of 5 mu m on JWST, will offer TSOs in two of its modes: the low resolution spectrometer, and the imager. In this paper we will describe these modes for MIRI, and discuss how they differ operationally from regular (non-TSO) observations. We will show performance estimates based on ground testing and modeling, discuss the most relevant detector effects for high precision (spectro-)photometry, and provide some guidelines for planning MIRI TSOs.

A consequence has been a realignment of modeling priorities and revised applications of modeling uncertainty factors and margins, which apply to multiple factors such as pointing and wavefront jitter, thermally-induced deformations, polarization, and aberration sensitivities. At the same time, the models have increased in fidelity as additional parameters have been added, such as time-dependent pupil shear and mid-spatial-frequency deformations of the primary and secondary mirrors, detector effects, and reaction-wheel-speed-dependent pointing and wavefront jitter.

As such, the baseline design of the HabEx observatory includes two complimentary starlight suppression systems that reveal the reflected light from the exoplanet - an internal coronagraph instrument, and an external, formation-flying starshade occulter. In addition, two general astrophysics instruments are baselined: a high-resolution ultraviolet spectrograph, and an ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared (UV/Vis/NIR), multi-purpose, wide-field imaging camera and spectrograph.

A model of the JWST three mirror anastigmat is realized with three lenses in the form of a Cooke triplet, which provides JWST-like optical quality over a field equivalent to a NIRCam module. An Iris AO hexagonally segmented mirror stands in for the JWST primary. This setup successfully produces images extremely similar to expected JWST in-flight point spread functions (PSFs), and NIRCam images from cryotesting, in terms of the PSF morphology and sampling relative to the diffraction limit. The segmentation of the primary mirror into subapertures introduces complexity into wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) of large space based telescopes like JWST. JOST provides a platform for independent analysis of WFS&C scenarios for both commissioning and maintenance activities on such observatories. We present an update of the current status of the testbed including both single field and wide-field alignment results. We assess the optical quality of JOST over a wide field of view to inform the future implementation of different wavefront sensing algorithms including the currently implemented Linearized Algorithm for Phase Diversity (LAPD). JOST complements other work at the Makidon Laboratory at the Space Telescope Science Institute, including the High-contrast imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed, that investigates coronagraphy for segmented aperture telescopes. Beyond JWST we intend to use JOST for WFS&C studies for future large segmented space telescopes such as LUVOIR.

How did the universe evolve in response to its changing ingredients? How common are life-bearing planets? To accomplish its scientific objectives, OST will operate at mid-and far-infrared wavelengths and offer superlative sensitivity and new spectroscopic capabilities. The OST study team will present a scientifically compelling, executable mission concept to the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astrophysics. To understand the concept solution space, our team studied two alternative mission concepts. We report on the study approach and describe both of these concepts, give the rationale for major design decisions, and briefly describe the mission-enabling technology.

Our current computer model was generated for LUVOIR Architecture Option A with a 15-meter aperture, 120-segment primary mirror. The methodology and simulation results will be presented and analyzed. JPL has a long history of technology development in laser metrology and edge sensors, including work in SIM [7], Keck and TMT [8], CCAT [3] and LUVOIR [1]. We will discuss our current efforts of LUVOIR laser metrology and edge-sensor models development, showing sensitivities of sensor measurements to various LUVOIR mirror eigen-modes, removing global modes and strengthening weak modes by performing joint (hybrid) laser-metrology and edge sensing. We will define and derive an important performance metric called wavefront error multiplier (WEM), and show that WEM provides a simple link between sensor errors and the closed-loop (controlled) system wavefront error. We will show WEM values for several hybrid sensor configuration options studied. We will discuss an algorithm for mirror shape control and maintenance through segment state and wavefront estimations using joint edge-metrology sensing. We will compare simulated performance of mirror state estimation, wavefront estimation and wavefront control based on joint edge-metrology sensing among several sensor configurations, and show the impact of sensor error distributions on the segmented mirror alignment performance. Mirror shape control performance will also be evaluated in the context of imaging contrast between inner working angles (IWA) and outer working angles (OWA) of a LUVOIR coronagraph.

Microthruster technology has matured significantly in recent years, with high specific impulse and low-level disturbance making microthrusters the prime candidate for high-precision pointing in upcoming space telescope missions. HabEx's Architecture A concept utilizes microthrusters as the main actuators for the attitude control system pointing mode and a fine steering piezo-electric-operated mirror is utilized in the inner fine-pointing loop of the attitude control system. Sensing is undertaken using a high-resolution, low-noise focal-plane camera that can support high readout speeds (> 100 Hz), in addition to a state-of-the-art low-order wavefront sensor, which is currently under technology development for NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).

The starshade is an external occulter which would be 72 m in diameter and fly some 124,000 km ahead of the telescope. A starshade instrument on board the telescope enables formation flying to maintain the starshade within 1 m of the line of sight to the star. The starshade instrument has various modes, including imaging from the near UV through to the near infrared and integral field spectroscopy in the visible band. The coronagraph would provide imaging and integral field spectroscopy in the visible band and would reach out to 1800 nm for low resolution spectroscopy in the near infrared. To provide the necessary stability for the coronagraph, the telescope would be equipped with a laser metrology system allowing measurement and control of the relative positions of the principal mirrors. In addition, a fine guidance sensor is needed for precision attitude control. The requirements for telescope stability for coronagraphy are discussed. The design and requirements on the starshade will also be discussed.

The telescope baseline design includes a high-contrast coronagraph and a starshade to enable the direct optical detection of exoplanets as close as 70 mas to their star. In addition to the study of exoplanets, HabEx carries two dedicated instruments for general astrophysics. The first instrument is a camera enabling imaging on a 3 arc minute field of view in two bands stretching from the UV at 150 nm to the near infrared at 1800 nm. The same instrument can also be operated as a multi-object spectrograph, with resolution of 2000. The second instrument is a high-resolution UV spectrograph operating from 300 nm down to 115 nm with up to 60,0000 resolution. HabEx would provide the highest resolution UV/optical images ever obtained. Diffraction limited at 0.4 mu m, it would outperform all current and approved facilities, including the 30 m class ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs), which will achieve similar to 0.01 arcsecond resolution at near-infrared (IR) wavelengths with adaptive optics, but will be seeing-limited at optical wavelengths. HabEx would observe wavelengths inaccessible from the ground, including the UV and in optical/near-IR atmospheric absorption bands. Operating at L2, far above the Earth's atmosphere and free from the large thermal swings inherent to HST's low-Earth orbit, HabEx would provide an ultra-stable platform that will enable science ranging from precision astrometry to the most sensitive weak lensing maps ever obtained. Here we discuss the design concepts of the general astrophysics optical instruments for the proposed observatory.

While in SPC mode, multiple sets of shaped pupil masks and focal plane masks would be available for various imaging tasks. The disk science mask set (SPC-DSM) is designed for exozodiacal disk science. With a 360 degree high contrast field of view, extending up to 20 lambda/D, the SPC-DSM provides a powerful tool to study exozodiacal dust clouds associated with stellar debris disks to gain insight of the exoplanet formation and stellar disk dynamics. We will describe the performance verification and demonstration of the SPC-DSM coronagraph as tested in the high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT) at JPL. The goal of the testbed demonstration is an average contrast of 5e-9 over a 10% bandwidth centered at 565nm, in a field of view extending from 6.5 lambda/D to 20 lambda/D.

OST will survey the most distant galaxies to discern the rise of metals and dust and to unveil the co-evolution of galaxy and blackhole formation, study the Milky Way to follow the path of water from the interstellar medium to habitable worlds in planetary systems, and measure biosignatures from exoplanets. This paper describes the science drivers and how they drove key requirements for OST Mission Concept 2, which will operate between similar to 5 and similar to 600 microns with a JWST sized telescope. Mission Concept 2 for the OST study optimizes the engineering for the key science cases into a powerful and more economical observatory compared to Mission Concept 1.

One science case enabled by the CGI will be taking visible images and (R similar to 50) spectra of faint interplanetary dust structures present in the habitable zone of nearby sunlike stars (similar to 10 pc) and within the snow-line of more distant ones (similar to 20 pc), down to dust brightness levels commensurate with that of the solar system zodiacal cloud. Reaching contrast levels below 10(-7) at sub-arcsecond angular scales for the first time, CGI will cross an important threshold in debris disks physics, accessing disks with low enough optical depths that their structure is dominated by transport mechanisms rather than collisions. Hence, CGI will help us understand how exozodiacal dust grains are produced and transported in low-density disks around mature stars. Additionally, CGI will be able to measure the brightness level and constrain the degree of asymmetry of exozodiacal clouds around individual nearby sunlike stars in the optical, at the similar to 3x solar zodiacal emission level. This information will be extremely valuable for optimizing the observational strategy of possible future exo-Earth direct imaging missions, especially those planning to operate at optical wavelengths as well, such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) and the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR).

A key priority for the HabEx mission concept would be to leverage affordable telescope solutions that can meet challenging telescope performance requirements with a demanding program timeline. The baseline approach for HabEx is to use an unobscured, monolithic primary mirror with a coronagraph to optimize system performance. NASA is performing an initial study to investigate the feasibility of a HabEx Lite concept which would not leverage a coronagraph and would therefore, have lower exoEarth yield as a consequence, but could provide system mass, cost, and schedule advantages. The HabEx Lite concept leverages replicated, ULE (R) mirror segments to provide an attractive, alternative telescope architecture to meet the HabEx threshold mission needs. We present the initial mirror design and performance assessment for the HabEx Lite concept.

The GEP telescopes and instruments are planned to be actively cooled with the system in a sun-earth L2 halo orbit. A detailed description of the GEP mission concept is documented in [1]. Crucial to the scientific performance of GEP is the thermal architecture; it must support a range of cryogenic elements, ranging from the full telescope optical assembly at around 4 K to the far-IR focal planes consisting of kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays cooled to 100 mK. Given the mass operating at these low temperatures, the thermal system is one of the main drivers of mission cost and complexity. We present a solution to the GEP thermal design that is realizable within a probe-class envelope. The baseline system utilizes a multi-stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) for the 100mK base; the ADR system also provides an intercept at 1K. ADR systems similar to that in our design have flown, and among sub-K options, ADRs offer high Carnot efficiency. The ADR rejects heat to a hybrid Joule Thompson (JT) and Stirling or PT Cryocooler with a low-temperature stage at 4 K as well as an intercept at 20 K. These coolers are also mature systems with flight heritage on most subcomponents.	[Moore, Bradley; Bradford, C.

Its main goal is the discovery and characterization of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. The baseline HabEx concept would use both a coronagraph and a starshade for exoplanet science. We describe an alternative, "HabEx Lite" concept, which would use a starshade (only) for exoplanet science. The benefit is lower cost: by deleting the complex coronagraph instrument; by lowering observatory mass; by relaxing tolerances and stability requirements; by permitting use of a compact on-axis telescope design; by use of a smaller launch vehicle. The scientific penalty of this lower cost option is a smaller number of detected exoplanets of all types, including exoEarth candidates, and a smaller fraction of exoplanets with measured orbits. Our approach uses a non-deployed segmented primary mirror, whose manufacture is within current capabilities.

The goal of FALCO is to provide a free, modular framework for the simulation or testbed operation of several common types of coronagraphs. FALCO includes routines for pair-wise probing estimation of the complex electric field and Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) control, and we ask the community to contribute other wavefront correction algorithms. FALCO utilizes and builds upon PROPER, an established optical propagation library. The key innovation in FALCO is the rapid computation of the linearized response matrix for each deformable mirror (DM), which facilitates re-linearization after each control step for faster DM-integrated coronagraph design and wavefront correction experiments. FALCO is freely available as source code in MATLAB at github.com/ajeldorado/falco-matlab and will be available later this year in Python 3 at github.com/ajeldorado/falco-python.	[Riggs, A. J.

It is well known that pupil obscurations degrade coronagraphic performance and complicate coronagraph design, so HabEx is planned to have an off-axis, unobscured primary mirror. We utilize the circular symmetry of the aperture to investigate 1D-radial coronagraph optimization methods that are prohibitively time-consuming or intractable in 2D, such as diffractive pupil remapping and concurrent, multi-plane optimization. We also directly constrain sensitivities to dynamic, low-order Zernike aberrations, which are separable in polar coordinates and can thus be propagated as 1D-radial integrals. The mask technologies in our designs claim heritage from the extensive modeling and testbed experiments performed by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) project. In this paper, we detail our optimization methods and outline future work to complete our design survey.	[Riggs, A. J.

The IFS will be key to understanding the spectral nature of the speckles, obtain science spectra of planets and disks, and will be used for broadband wavefront control. In order to characterize, predict, and optimize the performance of the instrument, we present a detailed model of the IFS in the context of the new OS6 observing scenario. The simulation includes spatial, spectral, and temporal variations of the speckle field on the IFS detector plane, which allows us to explore several post-processing methods and assess what gains can be expected. The simulator includes the latest models of the detector behavior when operating in photon-counting mode.

The quest for the optimal optical coronagraph designs has made rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design and Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of high-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors to (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diffracted starlight from obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the algorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be computationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys. Here, we utilize the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO), a tool that allows for rapid optimization of deformable mirror shapes, to explore trade-offs in coronagraph designs for obstructed and segmented space telescopes. We compare designs for representative shaped pupil Lyot and vortex coronagraphs, two of the most promising concepts for the LUVOIR space mission concept. We analyze the optical performance of each design, including their throughput and ability to passively suppress light from partially resolved stars in the presence of low-order aberrations. Our main result is that deformable mirror based apodization can sufficiently suppress diffraction from support struts and inter-segment gaps whose widths are on the order of similar to 0.1% of the primary mirror diameter to detect Earth-sized planets within a few tens of milliarcseconds from the star.

In this first installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.

Since its birth in 2016, this testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, has demonstrated several crucial technological milestones: Broadband high contrast demonstration in both Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) modes while the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem senses and corrects the dynamic flight-like wavefront disturbances. In this paper, we present up-to-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. While injecting the fiight-like low photon flux starlight with expected Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed, we demonstrate generating high contrast dark hole images. We first study the expected photon flux in actual flight environment, and estimate detection noise and estimation accuracy of the complex electric field if the wavefront sensing algorithm is used based on the pair-wise difference imaging. Then, we introduce our improved scheme to mitigate this photon-starved flight-like low flux environment. As a result, we generate a dark hole that meets the WFIRST raw contrast requirements using the 2nd magnitude star light. We establish the key ideas, describe test setups, and demonstrate test results with data analysis.

The WFIRST CGI LOWFS/C subsystem will use the Zernike wavefront sensor, which has a phase-shifting disk combined with the coronagraph's focal plane mask, to sense the low-order wavefront drift and line-of-sight (LoS) error using the rejected starlight. The dynamic tests on JPL's Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) Testbed have demonstrated that LOWFS/C can maintain coronagraph contrast to better than 10(-8) in presence of WFIRST-like line of sight and low order wavefront disturbances in both Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) modes. However, the previous dynamic tests have been done using a bright source with photon flux equivalent to stellar magnitude of M-V = -3.5. The LOWFS/C technology development on the OMC testbed has since then concentrated in evaluating and improving the LOWFS/C performance under the realistic photon flux that is equivalent to WFIRST Coronagraph target stars. Our recent testbed tests have demonstrated that the LOWFS/C can work cohesively with the stellar light suppression wavefront control, which brings broad band coronagraph contrast from similar to 1x10(-6) to 6x10(-9), while LOWF/C is simultaneously suppressing the WFIRST like LoS and low order wavefront drift disturbances on a source that photon flux is equivalent to a M-V = 2 star. This lab demonstration mimics the CGI initial dark hole establish process on a bright reference star. We have also demonstrated on the testbed that LOWFS/C can maintain the coronagraph contrast by suppressing the WFIRST like line-of-sight disturbances on a fainter M-V = 5 star.

FALCO rapidly calculates the linearized deformable mirror (DM) response matrices, also called control Jacobians, and can be used for the design, simulation, or testbed operation of several types of coronagraphs. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optical propagation used in FALCO is accurate and matches PROPER. In addition, we demonstrate the drastic reduction in runtime when using FALCO for DM Jacobian calculations instead of the conventional method used, for example with a model of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). We then compare the relative accuracy between optical models in FALCO and PROPER.	[Sidick, Erkin; Riggs, A. J.

In such a system the actuators of the deformable mirrors would be used for two purposes: To flatten the overall wavefront errors at a system pupil, and to create "dark-holes". The actuators have limited stroke ranges. Therefore, if the pupil phase errors are relatively large, flattening them completely could use up a significant portion of the actuator stroke, sometimes leaving insufficient stroke for creating the dark-holes. We have investigated the impact of partially-corrected pupil phase errors on a Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) broadband contrast performance. The predicted broadband contrast floor agrees well with those measured on the HLC testbed.

The majority of nearby FGK stars are located in multi-star systems, including the Alpha Centauri stars which may represent the best quality targets for the CGI on account of their proximity and brightness potentially allowing the direct imaging of rocky planets. However, a binary system exhibits additional leakage from the off-axis companion star that may be brighter than the target exoplanet. Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a wavefront-control technique that allows suppression of starlight of both stars in a binary system thus enabling direct imaging of circumstellar planets in binary star systems such as Alpha Centauri. We explore the capabilities of the WFIRST CGI instrument to directly image multi-star systems using MSWC. We consider several simulated scenarios using the WFIRST CGI's Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) Wide-Field Imaging Mode. First, we consider close binaries such as Mu Cassiopeia that require no modifications to the WFIRST CGI instrument and can be implemented as a purely algorithmic solution. Second, we consider wide binaries such as Alpha Centauri that require a diffraction grating to enable suppression of the off-axis starlight leakage at Super-Nyquist separations. We demonstrate via simulation dark holes in 10% broadband compatible with the WFIRST CGI.

However, the increased complexity of their aperture geometry, due to the central obstruction, support structures and segment gaps, makes high-contrast imaging very challenging. The High-contrast Imager for Complex Aperture Telescopes (HiCAT) testbed was designed to study and develop solutions for such telescope pupils using wavefront control and coronagraphic starlight suppression. The testbed design has the flexibility to enable studies with increasing complexity for telescope aperture geometries starting with off-axis telescopes, then on-axis telescopes with central obstruction and support structures - e.g. the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) - up to on-axis segmented telescopes, including various concepts for a Large UV, Optical, IR telescope (LUVOIR). In the past year, HiCAT has made significant hardware and software updates in order to accelerate the development of the project. In addition to completely overhauling the software that runs the testbed, we have completed several hardware upgrades, including the second and third deformable mirror, and the first custom Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) optimized for the HiCAT aperture, which is similar to one of the possible geometries considered for LUVOIR. The testbed also includes several external metrology features for rapid replacement of parts, and in particular the ability to test multiple apodizers readily, an active tip-tilt control system to compensate for local vibration and air turbulence in the enclosure. On the software and operations side, the software infrastructure enables 24/7 automated experiments that include routine calibration tasks and high-contrast experiments. In this communication we present an overview and status update of the project, both on the hardware and software side, and describe the results obtained with APLC wavefront control.

One NASA mission concept that could serve as the platform to realize this scientific breakthrough is the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR). Such a mission would also address a broad range of topics in astrophysics with a multi-wavelength suite of instruments. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph (APLC) is one of several coronagraph design families that the community is assessing as part of NASAs Exoplanet Exploration Program Segmented aperture coronagraph design and analysis (SCDA) team. The APLC is a Lyot-style coronagraph that suppresses starlight through a series of amplitude operations on the on-axis field. Given a suite of seven plausible segmented telescope apertures, we have developed an object-oriented software toolkit to automate the exploration of thousands of APLC design parameter combinations. This has enabled us to empirically establish relationships between planet throughput and telescope aperture geometry, inner working angle, bandwidth, and contrast level. In parallel with the parameter space exploration, we have investigated several strategies to improve the robustness of APLC designs to fabrication and alignment errors. We also investigate the combination of APLC with wavefront control or complex focal plane masks to improve inner working angle and throughput. Preliminary scientific yield evaluations based on design reference mission simulations indicate the APLC is a very competitive concept for surveying the local exoEarth population with a mission like LUVOIR.

The Venus Airglow Measurements and Orbiter for Seismicity (VAMOS) mission concept uses the fact that the dense Venusian atmosphere conducts seismic vibrations from the surface to the airglow layer of the ionosphere, as observed on Earth. Similarly, atmospheric gravity waves have been observed by the European Venus Express's Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) instrument. Such observations would enable VAMOS to determine the crustal structure and ionospheric variability of Venus without approaching the surface or atmosphere. Equipped with an instrument of modest size and mass, the baseline VAMOS spacecraft is designed to fit within an ESPA Grande form factor and travel to Venus predominantly under its own power. Trade studies have been conducted to determine mission architecture robustness to launch and rideshare opportunities. The VAMOS mission concept was studied at JPL as part of the NASA Planetary Science Deep Space SmallSat Studies (PSDS3) program, which has not only produced a viable and exciting mission concept for a Venus SmallSat, but has also examined many issues facing the development of SmallSats for planetary exploration, such as SmallSat solar electric propulsion, autonomy, telecommunications, and resource management that can be applied to various inner solar system mission architectures.

The proposed satellite has a fleet of instruments including the HEterodyne Receivers for OST (HERO). HERO is designed around the quest to follow the trail of water from the ISM to disks around protostars and planets. HERO will perform high-spectral resolution measurements with 2x9 pixel focal plane arrays at any frequency between 468GHz to 2,700GHz (617 to 111 mu m). HERO builds on the successful Herschel/HIFI heritage, as well as recent technological innovations, allowing it to surpass any prior heterodyne instrument in terms of sensitivity and spectral coverage.

PICO will probe the physics of the Big Bang and the energy scale of inflation, constrain the sum of neutrino masses, measure the growth of structures in the universe, and constrain its reionization history by making full sky maps of the cosmic microwave background with sensitivity 80 times higher than the Planck space mission. With bands at 21-799 GHz and arcmin resolution at the highest frequencies, PICO will make polarization maps of Galactic synchrotron and dust emission to observe the role of magnetic fields in Milky Way's evolution and star formation. We discuss PICO's optical system, focal plane, and give current best case noise estimates. The optical design is a two-reflector optimized open-Dragone design with a cold aperture stop. It gives a diffraction limited field of view (DLFOV) with throughput of 910 cm(2)sr at 21 GHz. The large 82 square degree DLFOV hosts 12,996 transition edge sensor bolometers distributed in 21 frequency bands and maintained at 0.1 K. We use focal plane technologies that are currently implemented on operating CMB instruments including three-color multi-chroic pixels and multiplexed readouts. To our knowledge, this is the first use of an open-Dragone design for mm-wave astrophysical observations, and the only monolithic CMB instrument to have such a broad frequency coverage. With current best case estimate polarization depth of 0.65 mu K-CMB-arcmin over the entire sky, PICO is the most sensitive CMB instrument designed to date.

To accomplish this, the optical system must suppress diffracted light from the star to reveal point sources approximately ten orders of magnitude fainter than the host star at small angular separation. Coronagraphs with microdot apodizers achieve the theoretical performance needed to image Earth-like planets with a range of possible telescope designs, including those with obscured and segmented pupils. A test microdot apodizer with various bulk patterns (step functions, gradients, and sinusoids) and 4 different dot sizes (3 mu m, 5 rho m, 7 mu m, and 10 mu m) made of small chrome squares on anti-reflective glass was characterized with microscopy, optical laser interferometry, as well as transmission and reflectance measurements at wavelengths lambda=600 nm and lambda=800 nm. Microscopy revealed the microdots were fabricated to high precision. Results from laser interferometry showed that the phase shifts observed in reflection vary with the local microdot fill factor. This effect is not explained purely by interference between reflected fields from the chrome and glass portions. Transmission measurements showed that microdot fill factor and transmission were linearly related for dot sizes >= 5 mu m. However, anomalously high transmittance was measured when the dot size is <5x the wavelength (i.e. similar to 3 mu m) and the fill factor is approximately 50%, where the microdot pattern becomes periodic. The transmission excess is not as prominent in the case of larger dot sizes suggesting that it is likely to be caused by the interaction between the incident field and electronic resonances in the surface of the metallic microdots. We used our empirical models of the microdot apodizers to optimize a second generation of reflective apodizer designs, specifically for demonstrating end-to-end instrumentation for planet characterization at Caltech's High Contrast Spectroscopy Testbed for Segmented Telescopes (HCST), and confirmed that the amplitude and phase of the reflected beam closely matches the ideal wavefront.

Built upon features of recently testbed validated model, it is further refined to combine a full Fresnel propagation diffraction model for high accuracy contrast truth evaluation, and an economical compact model for WFC purposes. Extensive individual raw contrast error sensitivities are evaluated systematically, both as known imperfections and as unknown calibration errors, for two CGI modes: spectroscopy mode and wide field-of-view mode with shaped pupil coronagraph. More than 90 distinct error items were identified, including system aberrations, optical misalignment, component fabrication errors, telescope interface related errors, etc. The result forms the basis for raw contrast error budget flow down to a sub-system level, where detailed specifications needed to aid in component design and manufacturing, mechanical alignment and instrument integration, and verification and validation operations. Evaluations are automated, making it relatively easy for repeat runs of revised design or at new desired error quantity. Observations from the comprehensive analysis and top error sensitivities and contrast floor contributors are noted and discussed. Error budget flowdown process is also briefly described.

The single-photon-counting detector arrays that are used to sense this beacon under photon-starved conditions may be count-rate limited due to blocking from detector quench times and other readout circuit constraints. This blocking effect reduces the effective detection efficiency in a non-uniform manner over the array, changing the photon counting channel model and degrading the performance of uplink centroiding algorithms. In this paper, we discuss an uplink beacon centroiding algorithm and the impact of detector blocking on this algorithm. Statistical models of detector output data and centroiding observables are presented based upon analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and measured laboratory data, incorporating realistic effects such as beacon signal parameters and Earth background. A simple blocking compensation algorithm is presented and shown to mitigate the effect of blocking, allowing one to maintain sub-microradian centroiding errors under channel conditions representative of deep space optical links.

Steady advances in these technologies, validated through space-to-ground demonstrations, have resulted in incremental advances with the deep-space optical communications (DSOC) technology demonstration being one of the next milestones on NASA's roadmap. NASA's Psyche Mission to launch early next decade plans to host a DSOC flight laser transceiver for link demonstrations extending from 0.1 to farther than 2 astronomical units (AU). The capabilities validated though this demonstration, we expect, could spur the use of optical communications infrastructure around Mars in the next few decades. In this paper we summarize ongoing activities underway at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in preparation for the DSOC technology demonstration and go on to present discussions on the drivers for developing a robust deep space laser communications operational capability.

FPGA design rules such as power conditioning and signal integrity for properly interfacing high speed FPGA with its interface circuits are discussed in this paper as it relates to aerospace systems. Signal integrity to avoid crosstalk within a FPGA has not been a great concern because most of the attention over the years had been on signal integrity at the PCB level.

The spacecraft contains a ground penetrating radar, consisting of an array of four VHF antennas, that will characterize the surface of Jupiter's icy moon Europa. Measured far-field radiation patterns and reflection coefficients above a 50x80m perfect ground plane are compared to predicted results using commercial software. Normalized Far-Field radiation pattern cuts are measured utilizing a biconical antenna and receiver mounted on a flying drone. Simulations of the radiation pattern show that the number of lobes increases with the distance of the antenna from the ground due to the ground-bounce phenomenon. In addition, the measured and simulated reflection coefficients stay unchanged for height above 2 meters, which matches the predicted calculation of the reactive-near field region of this antenna. However, the antenna electrical parameters are optimized for use on the spacecraft and become detuned in the presence of a ground plane. Simulated and measured return loss discrepancy less than 0.5 dB is presented. Radiation pattern comparisons show similar agreement when taking into account the effect of far-field measurement uncertainties.

This contribution is the final part of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the workshop, and presents an overview of novel optical technologies and systems that are implemented or considered for high-contrast imaging instruments on both ground-based and space telescopes. The overall objective of high contrast instruments is to provide direct observations and characterizations of exoplanets at contrast levels as extreme as 10(-)(10). We list shortcomings of current technologies, and identify opportunities and development paths for new technologies that enable quantum leaps in performance. Specifically, we discuss the design and manufacturing of key components like advanced deformable mirrors and coronagraphic optics, and their amalgamation in "adaptive coronagraph" systems. Moreover, we discuss highly integrated system designs that combine contrast-enhancing techniques and characterization techniques (like high-resolution spectroscopy) while minimizing the overall complexity. Finally, we explore extreme implementations using all-photonics solutions for ground-based telescopes and dedicated huge apertures for space telescopes.

The primary function of a starshade is to suppress light from a target star such that its orbiting planets are revealed. In order to do so, the optical edges of the starshade must maintain their precise in-plane profile to produce the necessary apodization function. However, an equally important consideration is the interaction of these edges with light emanating from our own Sun as scattered and/or diffracted sunlight can significantly degrade the achievable contrast. This paper describes the technical efforts performed to obtain precision, low-scatter optical edges for future starshades. Trades between edge radius (i.e. sharpness) and surface reflectivity have been made and small-scale coupons have been produced using scalable manufacturing processes. A custom scattered light testbed has been developed to quantify the magnitude of scattered light over all sun angles. Models have also been developed to make predictions on the level of reflected and/or diffracted light for various edge architectures. The results of these studies have established a current baseline approach which implements photochemical etching techniques on thin metal foils.

These concepts currently call for apertures as large as 15 m (LUVOIR), and operational temperatures as low as 4 Kelvin (OST). Advanced mirror technologies, such as those implementing a high degree of actuation at the primary, can help to overcome the challenges associated with these missions by providing in-situ wavefront correction capabilities. Active mirrors can also greatly reduce the cost/complexity associated with mirror fabrication as well as system I&T as on-orbit performance specifications can be achieved under a variety of test conditions (i.e. room/cryogenic temperatures, 0g/lg). JPL has significant experience in this area for visible/near-infrared applications, however future mission requirements create a new set of challenges for this technology. This paper presents design, analysis, and test results for lightweight silicon-carbide mirrors with integrated actuation capabilities. In particular, studies have been performed to test the performance of these mirrors at cryogenic temperatures.

This transition was motivated by the cost and complexity of large, monolithic optical surfaces. Space telescopes, driven by the same practicalities, are beginning to make this same transition. The challenge is to accurately phase these apertures such that they behave as a single monolithic mirror. Here we introduce a new method for this co-alignment based upon a classic knife-edge technique. The advantage of this method is: 1) it has a very large dynamic range, 2) it works with broadband light and is therefore very photon efficient, 3) it requires only a single mechanism and single sensor, 4) it works equally well with sparsely filled apertures as well as filled apertures, 5) it phases all the segments simultaneously, 6) requires no additional segment motion diversity for sensing. In this paper, we review the knife-edge method, provide context for the segment phasing problem, perform numerical simulations of the sensor, and provide preliminary laboratory confirmation of this method with a demonstration with a segmented deformable mirror.

Super-resolution is performed in time using a variational approach. By temporal super-resolution, we mean recovering rapidly evolving events that were corrupted by the induced blur of the sensor. A blurred sequence of observations is assumed to have been generated by convolution of a physical scene with a temporal rectangular convolution kernel whose support is the sensor exposure time. We solve the deconvolution problem using the Split-Bregman method. Such methodology is based on current research in sparse optimization and compressed sensing, which lead to unprecedented efficiencies for solving image reconstruction problems. We test our method using a simulated temporally blurred and noisy temporal precipitation sequence and show that our method significantly reduces the errors in the corrupted sequence.

Rapid Optical Detection and Classification of Microbes in Suspicious Powders	CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND EXPLOSIVES (CBRNE) SENSING XIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Meeting of the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) Sensing as part of the SPIE Defense and Commercial Sensing (DCS) Symposium	APR 16-18, 2018	Orlando, FL	SPIE		deep UV Raman; native fluorescence; chemical; biological; explosives; detection; classification; standoff; handheld	RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; BACTERIAL; AGENT	This paper describes a rapid, reagentless, standoff method of detection & classification of bulk and trace suspicious substances on natural surfaces using solar-blind deep UV excitation and detection. Detection is typically accomplished in less one second. The detection method is solar blind and can be employed at standoff distances up to 5 m or more without interference from natural or man-made light sources. By this method, unknown suspicious powders, that potentially contain biological hazards, are automatically triaged using a four-step sequential iteration of Principal Component Analysis methods using pre-determined eigenvector sets to: 1) detect and differentiate whether a sample is bio or non-bio; 2) whether the detected bio is microbial, protein, or plant; 3) if microbial, whether the sample is a bacterial cell or spore, yeast, fungi, or fungal spore; and 4) to provide some higher level of cellular differentiability. The same method is also applicable to a wide range of chemical agents and explosives materials. The method and related instruments employ sample excitation at 248.6 nm and detection over a spectral range from 250 nm to below 350 nm, a spectral region blind to solar and most man-made light sources. Detection and classification is accomplished in less a few seconds. Sample detection and classification rates can be over 20 per second. Fully integrated and self-contained hand-held instruments are presently under development with an overall weight less than about 8 lbs, including a battery for over 8 hours of typical use. The standoff detection range is nominally 5 cm to 5 m.	[Hug, W. F.; Sijapati, K.; Nguyen, Q.; Oswal, P.; Reid, R.

Linear Rate-Compatible Codes with Degree-1 Extending Variable Nodes Under Iterative Decoding	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUN 17-22, 2018	Vail, CO	IEEE, IEEE Informat Theory Soc, NSF, Huawei, Qualcomm			PARITY-CHECK CODES; RAPTOR CODES	rate-compatible (RC) code first transmits a set of symbols corresponding to the highest rate. These symbols form the highest-rate code (HRC). If requested by the receiver, the transmitter subsequently sends symbols that lower the rate of the code. Additional symbols are sent until the decoder decodes to a codeword or all symbols of the RC code are exhausted. Consider linear, RC low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed using extending variable nodes of degree 1. That is, every symbol of incremental redundancy (IR) is a linear combination only of symbols of the HRC. We study the convergence of such codes under iterative decoding. We show that the convergence criterion considered after each iteration need only check whether the HRC variable nodes have converged to a codeword. Specifically, there is no need to consider whether the parity checks that generate the IR symbols are satisfied. We substantiate these claims with simulation results of protograph-based raptor-like LDPC (PBRL) codes, which are a family of protograph RC-LDPC codes with the extending structure under consideration. Furthermore, we demonstrate using examples that this extending structure for protograph RC codes is not very far from the optimal extension for a protograph RC code by providing examples of iterative decoding thresholds for PBRL protographs and protographs extended using the optimal degrees for incremental variable nodes.

The ability to quantify noise is crucial for these applications, e.g., when the sensor is used for map generation or to develop a sensor scheduling policy in a multi-sensor setup. Range error models provide uncertainty estimates and help weigh the data correctly in instances where range measurements are taken from different vantage points or with different sensors. Such a model is derived in this work. We show that the range error for stereo systems with integrated illuminators is cubic and validate the proposed model experimentally with an off-the-shelf structured light stereo system. The experiments confirm the validity of the model and simplify the application of this type of sensor in robotics.

Robust Visual Localization for Hopping Rovers on Small Bodies	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, CSIRO, Australian Govt, Dept Def Sci & Technol, DJI, Queensland Univ Technol, Woodside, Baidu, Bosch, Houston Mechatron, Kinova Robot, KUKA, Hit Robot Grp, Honda Res Inst, iRobot, Mathworks, NuTonomy, Ouster, Uber				We present a collaborative visual localization method for rovers designed to hop and tumble across the surface of small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids. In a two-phase approach, an orbiting primary spacecraft first maps the surface of a body by capturing images from various poses and illumination angles; these images are processed to create a prior map of 3D landmarks. In the second phase, a hopping rover is deployed to the surface where it uses a camera to relocalize to the prior map and to perform onboard visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Small bodies present several unique challenges to existing visual SLAM algorithms, such as high-contrast shadows that move quickly over the surface due to the short (e.g. 1-12 hour) rotational periods, and large changes in visual appearance between orbit and the surface, where image scale varies by many orders of magnitude (kilometers to centimeters). In this work, we describe how to augment ORB-SLAM2-a state of the art visual SLAM implementation-to handle large variations in illumination by fusing prior images with varying illumination angles. We demonstrate how a hopping rover can use a wide field of view (FOV) camera to relocalize to prior maps captured by an orbiting spacecraft with a narrow FOV camera, and how the growth of pose and scale errors can be bounded by periodic loop closures during large hops. The proposed method is evaluated with sequences of images captured around a mock asteroid; it is shown to be robust to varying illumination angles, scene scale changes, and off-nadir camera pointing angles.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for manipulation event segmentation and manipulation event parsing. The proposed framework incorporates hand pose kinematics and contact forces using a low-cost easy-to-replicate tactile glove. We use a temporal grammar model to capture the hierarchical structure of events, integrating extracted force vectors from the raw sensory input of poses and forces. The temporal grammar is represented as a temporal And-Or graph (T-AOG), which can be induced in an unsupervised manner.

Previous works have treated quadrotors as differentially flat systems, and this property has been exploited widely to design simple algorithms that generate dynamically feasible trajectories and to enable hierarchical control. The differentially flat property allows the full state of the quadrotor to be extracted from the reduced dimensional space of x, y, z, yaw and their derivatives. This differential flatness transformation has a number of singularities, however, as well as stability issues when controlling near these singularities. Many methods have been described in the literature to address these; however, they all have limitations when exploring the full flight envelope of a quadrotor, including roll or pitch angles past 90 degrees, and during inverted flight. In this paper, we review these existing methods and then introduce our method, which combines multiple methods to provide a highlyrobust differential flatness transformation that addresses most of these issues. Our approach is demonstrated enabling highlyaggressive quadrotor flight in both simulations and real-world experiments.

Unfortunately, none of these existing 3D memory cubes are ready for harsh space environments. This paper presents a new memory cube architecture for space, based on vertical integration of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), 3D stacked, DRAM memory devices with a custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller offering high memory capacity, robust reliability and low latency. Validation and evaluation of the ASIC controller will be conducted prior to tape-out on a custom FPGA-based emulator platform integrating the 3D-stack.

This protection would require "breaking the chain of contact (BTC)", where any returned material reaching Earth for further analysis would have to be sealed inside a container with extremely high confidence. Therefore, the acquired samples would need to be contained while destroying any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of the container. A novel process that could be used to contain returning samples has been developed and demonstrated in a quarter scale size. The process consists of brazing using non-contact induction heating that synchronously separates, seams, seals and sterilizes (S4) the container. The use of brazing involves melting at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C and this level of heating assures sterilization of the exposed areas since all carbon bonds (namely, organic materials) are broken at this temperature. The mechanism consists of a double wall container with inner and outer shells having Earth-clean interior surfaces. The process consists of two-steps, Step-1: the double wall container halves are fabricated and brazed (equivalent to production on Earth); and Step-2 is the S4 process and it is the equivalent to the execution on-orbit around Mars. In a potential future mission, the double wall container would be split into two halves and prepared on Earth. The potential on-orbit execution would consist of inserting the orbiting sample (OS) container into one of the halves and then mated to the other half and brazed. The latest results of this effort will be described and discussed in this manuscript.

J	Falco, G; Viswanathan, A; Caldera, C; Shrobe, H				Falco, Gregory; Viswanathan, Arun; Caldera, Carlos; Shrobe, Howard			A Master Attack Methodology for an AI-Based Automated Attack Planner for Smart Cities	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						AI planning; attack trees; cyber audit tools; cyber risk; cybersecurity; IIoT; IoT; smart cities		America's critical infrastructure is becoming "smarter'' and increasingly dependent on highly specialized computers called industrial control systems (ICS). Networked ICS components now called the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are at the heart of the "smart city'', controlling critical infrastructure, such as CCTV security networks, electric grids, water networks, and transportation systems. Without the continuous, reliable functioning of these assets, economic and social disruption will ensue. Unfortunately, IIoT are hackable and difficult to secure from cyberattacks. This leaves our future smart cities in a state of perpetual uncertainty and the risk that the stability of our lives will be upended. The Local government has largely been absent from conversations about cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, despite its importance. One reason for this is public administrators do not have a good way of knowing which assets and which components of those assets are at the greatest risk. This is further complicated by the highly technical nature of the tools and techniques required to assess these risks. Using artificial intelligence planning techniques, an automated tool can be developed to evaluate the cyber risks to critical infrastructure. It can be used to automatically identify the adversarial strategies (attack trees) that can compromise these systems. This tool can enable both security novices and specialists to identify attack pathways. We propose and provide an example of an automated attack generation method that can produce detailed, scalable, and consistent attack trees-the first step in securing critical infrastructure from cyberattack.

Challenges pertaining to the introduction of an AD tool based on operator overloading have been studied in the past. However, in order to assess possible performance gains or to verify derivative values, it is advantageous to be able to apply more than one AD tool to a given code. Hence, in this work, we investigate usability issues when exchanging AD tools. Our study is based on the NASA/JPL/UCI Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) which currently employs the AD tool ADOL-C. We introduce CoDiPack to ISSM, a more recent AD tool offering a similar set of features while promising performance improvements. In addition to the obvious type change for the AD-augmented float type, this transition requires the change to a different adjoint MPI library, adaptation of the MUMPS solver wrapper, and changes to the derivative seeding and extraction routines. We believe that these issues are fairly generic for numerical simulation software, and the issues we report on provide a blueprint for similar undertakings. We also believe that our experiences provide guidance towards the development of AD interfaces that support AD tool interoperability. In addition, we improve upon the memory management of the existing ADOL-C instrumentation, which exhibited considerable runtime problems for higher mesh resolutions. We conduct serial and parallel ISSM model runs on a 2D mass transport benchmark as well as a model of the Pine Island Glacier to verify the derivatives computed by both tools and report on runtime performance and memory usage. In comparison, the CoDiPack AD variant of ISSM runs faster with less memory overhead than the ADOL-C variant and, thus, enables future model runs with an increased number of mesh elements. But the existence of two different AD implementations provides added confidence in the correctness of derivatives, in particular for future AD tool versions.

In this work, we construct a finite-state abstraction on which a control policy is synthesized and refined back to the original belief model. We introduce a new notion of label based approximate stochastic simulation to quantify the deviation between belief models. We develop a robust synthesis methodology that yields a lower bound on the satisfaction probability, by compensating for deviations a priori, and that utilizes a less conservative control refinement.

After the immense success of these radars, two new spaceborne atmospheric radars, the EarthCARE Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) [5], and the Radar in a CubeSat (RainCube) [6] have been developed and will be launched in the upcoming years, and several new radar concepts have been developed and are being considered for a variety of mission concepts. For example, spaceborne precipitation and cloud radars operating at multiple frequencies (e.g., Ku-, Ka- and W-band simultaneously) with a single antenna, and that provide scanning, polarimetric and Doppler capabilities at all frequencies; extremely compact radar architectures that enable accommodation of this category of radars in spacecrafts as small as a 6U CubeSats, as well as Doppler-capable millimeter-wave weather radars for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, are being defined and developed. These new instrument concepts are intended to fill the current observational gaps in the advancement of weather and climate models, and leverage on the TRMM, GPM and CloudSat experiences.

The robotic spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004 after a 7-year flight from Earth, dropped a European Space Agency (ESA) parachuted probe named Huygens to study the atmosphere and surface of Saturn's big moon Titan, and commenced making astonishing discoveries. NASA's Cassini spacecraft explored the Saturn system for over 13 years, finally vaporizing in Saturn's atmosphere on 15 September 2017 to protect the ocean worlds, Enceladus and Titan, where it discovered potential habitats for life. During those 13 years in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini-Huygens mission made some amazing discoveries and revealed the breathtaking beauty of the Saturn system. Some of Cassini's most surprising scientific discoveries came from encounters with Saturn's intriguing moons. Those discoveries include icy jets emanating from the south pole of tiny Enceladus, a moon that harbors a subsurface global ocean and hydrothermal activity. On giant Titan, methane rain carves river channels and fills lakes and seas with hydrocarbons, mixed with complex pre-biotic chemicals that form in its atmosphere and rain to the surface. These discoveries have fundamentally altered many of our concepts of where life might be found in our own solar system and beyond. Some of Cassini's other amazing findings include a myriad of three-dimensional structures in the dynamic rings driven by interactions with Saturn's moons and interior; a giant Saturn storm that circled the entire planet for most of 2011, while a long-lived hexagonal jet stream discovered by Voyager in 1981 continues to encircle the north pole. Cassini solved the mystery of Iapetus' dual bright-dark surface, while uncovering another: the true rotation rate of Saturn's interior, thought to be precisely determined by Pioneer 11 and the Voyagers, remains unknown. Cassini's findings at Saturn have also fundamentally altered many of our concepts of how planets form around other stars. This flagship mission was a cooperative undertaking by NASA, ESA, and the Italian space agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)).

In systems and software engineering, ICDs are key artifacts that specify the interface(s) to a system or subsystem, and are used to control the documentation of these interfaces. ICDs enable independent teams to develop connecting systems that use the specified interfaces. In the context of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), interface control documents also act as contracts for delivered subsystems. The Alignment and Phasing system (APS) is one such subsystem. APS is required to implement a particular interface, and formulates requirements for the interfaces to be provided by other components of TMT that interface with APS. As the design of APS matures, these interfaces are frequently refined, making it necessary for related ICDs to be updated. In current systems engineering practice, ICDs are maintained manually. This manual maintenance can lead to a loss in integrity and accuracy of the documents over time, resulting in the documents no longer reflecting the actual state of the interfaces of a system. We show how a system model in SysML (TM) can be used to generate ICDs automatically. The method is demonstrated through application to interface control documents pertaining to APS. Specifically, we apply the method to the interface of APS to the primary mirror control system (M1CS) and of APS to the Telescope Control System (TCS). We evaluate the newly introduced method through application to two case studies.	[Herzig, Sebastian J.

Its content has emerged from the system level modeling effort on the European Framework Program 6 (FP6) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). The TMT MBSE approach applied the Executable Systems Engineering Method (ESEM) and the open-source Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE) to specify, analyze, and verify requirements of TMT's Alignment and Phasing System (APS) and the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS). In these applications, implicit dependencies are made explicit in a formal model through the use of ESEM, OpenMBEE, and SysML modeling constructs. The value proposition for applying this MBSE approach was to establish precise requirements and fine-grained traceability to system designs, and to verify key requirements beginning early in development. The integration of ESEM and the OpenMBEE tooling infrastructure (providing linked-data and web-operability) is a significant added value for the MBSE approach. The APS is responsible for the overall pre-adaptive optics wavefront quality, using starlight to measure wavefront errors and align the TMT optics. In the formally integrated and executable SysML model, simulations are performed to analyze the impact of changed requirements and verify specified constraints for various operational scenarios. The APS team used several modeling patterns to capture information such as the requirements, the operational scenarios, involved subsystems and their interaction points, the estimated or required time durations, and the mass and power consumption. Adaptive optics systems are designed to sense real-time atmospheric turbulence and correct the telescope's optical beam to remove its effect. The system model for the adaptive optics operational modes was developed to capture sequence behaviors and operational scenarios to run Monte-Carlo simulations for verifying acquisition time, observing efficiency, and operational behavior requirements. The model is particularly useful for investigating the effect of parallelization, identifying interface issues, and re-ordering sequence acquisition tasks. A former version of the Cookbook (which is now updated to MBSE challenges, goals, and lessons learned) included modeling guidelines and conventions for all system aspects, hierarchy levels, and views, which were developed during for the Active Phasing Experiment (APE), an opto-mechatronical system technology demonstrator for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). The Cookbook utilizes the above mentioned system models as real-world case-studies to demonstrate and document the applications of the recipes, providing also instructional examples and addressing the available tooling support. The Cookbook is accompanied by a number of SysML models and aodel libraries which facilitate model authoring and maintenance. The Cookbook covers the different aspects of Systems Engineering such as management of Requirements, Design (behavior and structure), Interfaces, Interdisciplinary Integration, Analysis, Trade Studies, and Technical Resources. This paper presents the background, motivation, architecture, and highlights some key content of the Cookbook. For example, interface management, error budget management, requirements verification, Monte Carlo driven analysis, and timing analysis of operational scenarios. The paper discusses how the capabilities of OpenMBEE contributed significantly to the adoption of executable systems engineering.

The TMT alignment is performed by the Global Metrology System (GMS) and the Alignment and Phasing System (APS). The GMS first measures the locations of the telescope optics and instruments as a function of elevation angle. These initial measurements will be used to adjust the optics positions and build initial elevation look-up tables. Then the telescope is aligned using starlight as the input for the APS at multiple elevation angles. APS measurements are used to refine the telescope alignment to build elevation and temperature dependent look-up tables. Due to the number of degrees of freedom in the telescope (over 10,000), the ability of the primary mirror to correct aberrations on other optics, the tight optical performance requirements and the multiple instrument locations, it is challenging to develop, test and validate these alignment procedures. In this paper, we consider several GMS and APS operational scenarios. We apply the alignment procedures to the model-generated TMT, which consists of various quasi-static errors such as polishing errors, passive supports errors, thermal and gravity deformations and installation position errors. Using an integrated optical model and Monte-Carlo framework, we evaluate the TMT's aligned states using optical performance metrics at multiple instrument and field of view locations. The optical performance metrics include the Normalized Point Source Sensitivity (PSSN), RMS wavefront error before and after Adaptive Optics (AO) correction, pupil position change, and plate scale distortion.

The search for liquid water in our solar system has revealed that several moons of the outer solar system harbor oceans beneath their icy shells. Halogen salts serve as a key indicator of whether or not these liquid water environments could satisfy the latter two requirements for life. The presence of salts within these oceans is, and can be, an indicator of water-rock interactions between liquid water and silicate, halogen-rich, seafloors. In some cases, seafloor cycling within these moons may be sufficient to drive low-, or possibly even high-temperature hydrothermalism. Here I review the current state of knowledge of these oceans beyond Earth and provide both empirical and modelling constraints on halogens within these environments. Past, present, and future spacecraft missions to these worlds are described, and the implications for future discoveries of astrobiological importance is discussed.

Current aerospace qualified primary battery technologies cannot adequately meet the mass and volume requirements of proposed missions. Although they have not been used in prior deep space landed missions, lithium carbon-fluoride (Li/CFx) technologies were identified as a potentially viable option, both with and without blends of manganese dioxide (MnO2). To meet the performance requirements over the intended operating conditions of future NASA missions requires further development of this technology, in particular in the delivery of a high specific energy at moderate to low temperatures, and low discharge rates. A cell development effort was therefore pursued with an industrial battery cell manufacturer. Low (50 mA) and medium (250 mA) discharge rates were used to assess the performance of D-size cells under mission relevant conditions, between 0 degrees C and -40 degrees C. Select AA-size and C-size cells were also evaluated using similar rates scaled to the lower cell capacities. Developmental Li/CFx-MnO2 D-size cells designed for higher specific energy over these conditions were fabricated and tested, targeting operation between 0 and -40 degrees C and a 50 mA constant discharge current, as the baseline operating condition.

Several authors already modeled the geodetic data in terms of the mechanical interaction of the events in the seismic sequence. Liquefaction has been extensively observed, suggesting an important role of fluids in the sequence. In this work, we focus on the poroelastic effects induced by the two mainshocks. In particular, the target of this work is to model the influence of fluids and pore-pressure changes on surface displacements and on the Coulomb failure function (CFF). The fluid flow and poroelastic modeling was performed in a 3D half-space whose elastic and hydraulic parameters are depth dependent, in accordance with the geology of the Emilia-Romagna subsoil. The model provides both the poroelastic displacements and the pore-pressure changes induced coseismically by the two mainshocks at subsequent periods and their evolution over time. Modeling results are then compared with postseismic InSAR and GPS displacement time series: the InSAR data consist of two SBAS series presented in previous works, while the GPS signal was detected adopting a variational Bayesian independent component analysis (vbICA) method. Thanks to the vbICA, we are able to separate the contribution of afterslip and poroelasticity on the horizontal surface displacements recorded by the GPS stations. The poroelastic GPS component is then compared to the modeled displacements and shown to be mainly due to drainage of the shallowest layers. Our results offer an estimation of the poroelastic effect magnitude that is small but not negligible and mostly confined in the near field of the two mainshocks. We also show that accounting for a 3D fault representation with a nonuniform slip distribution and the elastic-hydraulic layering of the half-space has an important role in the simulation results.

Separating targets from background clutter with high precision is a challenging operation for both humans and computers. Currently, segmenting objects from IR images is done by tedious manual work. The implementation of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to perform precision segmentation of multi-band IR video images is presented. A customized pix2pix DNN with multiple layers of generative encoder/decoder and discriminator architecture is used in the IR image segmentation process. Real and synthetic images and ground truths are employed to train the DNN. Iterative training is performed to achieve optimum accuracy of segmentation using a minimal number of training data. Special training images are created to enhance the missing features and to increase the segmentation accuracy of the objects. Retraining strategies are developed to minimize the DNN training time. Single pixel accuracy has been achieved in IR target boundary segmentation using DNNs. The segmentation accuracy between the customized pix2pix DNN and simple thresholding, GraphCut, simple neural network and ResNet models are compared.

A unique approach to training segmentation is to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with a minimal amount of initial labeled training samples. The procedure involves creating synthetic data and using image registration to calculate affine transformations to apply to the synthetic data. The method takes a small dataset and generates a high quality augmented reality synthetic dataset with strong variance while maintaining consistency with real cases.

Support for reducing these risks is important. We built a partially occluded object reconstruction method on augmented reality glasses for first responders. We used a deep learning based on conditional generative adversarial networks to train associations between the various images of flammable and hazardous objects and their partially occluded counterparts. Our system then reconstructed an image of a new flammable object. Finally, the reconstructed image was superimposed on the input image to provide "transparency". The system imitates human learning about the laws of physics through experience by learning the shape of flammable objects and the flame characteristics.

Where there is a potential risk for interference or permanent damage, further analysis is required to evaluate the feasibility of mitigation schemes, such as mechanical reconfiguration of antennas or additional RF filtering. From these coupling analysis results, radiated susceptibility RS103 requirements are derived to better reflect actual requirement levels with adequate test margins.

It was also detected in hot cores around high-mass protostars along with a recent detection in the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. We propose here a gas-grain chemical model to form CH3NCO after reviewing various formation pathways with quantum chemical computations. We have used NAUTILUS three-phase gas-grain chemical model to compare observed abundances in the IRAS 16293-2422. Our chemical model clearly indicates the ice phase origin of CH3NCO.

Thus, the integrity of a levee is an important issue that needs to be checked frequently. This can be achieved by long-term monitoring of the subsidence of the levee to identify potential weak sections and prioritize maintenance efforts. This paper presents the use of affordable sensing technologies, such as satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), to monitor the settlement of the New Orleans area. Data from TerraSAR-X, the German Space Agency's X-band satellite, was processed with the interferometric point target analysis technique in the gamma remote sensing software for widespread settlement monitoring. The time frame of the data is from 2009 to 2014. In situ measurements from GPS and extensometers are used to verify the remote sensing results, and a good agreement of displacement trends between the two methods was obtained. The favorable comparison increases confidence in the suitability of remote sensing techniques to monitor the long-term displacement of entire levee systems.

Hadamard variance is used to analyzed the unfiltered and the filtered clock systems. The filtered clock system is constructed using a Kalman filter and accounts for the fractional power spectral density of the pulsar timing noise. Pulsar-aided compact atomic clocks do not have frequency drift induced by the random walk frequency noise as long as the pulsar timing model remains accurate. The result of the analysis shows that pulsars have the potential of enhancing the long-term stability of standalone compact atomic clocks, and the amount of improvement in steady state is dependent not only on pulsar's frequency stability but also on that of the clock.

We used bidirectional deep recurrent neural networks to train and test speech recognition performance. We showed that data augmentation and custom language models can improve speech recognition accuracy. Transcribing communications from the launch control center will help the machine analyze information and accelerate knowledge generation.

Polarization considerations in the multi-angle imager for aerosols (MAIA)	POLARIZATION: MEASUREMENT, ANALYSIS, AND REMOTE SENSING XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Conference on Polarization - Measurement, Analysis, and Remote Sensing XIII	APR 16-17, 2018	Orlando, FL	SPIE		aerosols; remote sensing; public health; polarization; quarter-wave plates		The significant effects of aerosols on public health and climate drive a growing necessity for the characterization of particulate matter in air pollutants. The earth-orbiting Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument will combine radiance and polarization measurements to derive features of ground-level particulate matter. The optical design requires an in-depth analysis of several key polarization factors in order to meet stringent requirements on radiometric and polarimetric accuracy. A simple two-layer optical coating, a pair of achromatic quarter-wave plates, and analysis of the polarization aberrations are used to minimize the effects of polarization errors and achieve high polarimetric accuracy.

Enhanced mechanical properties of additively manufactured bulk metallic glasses produced through laser foil printing from continuous sheetmetal feedstock	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Laser foil printing; Bulk metallic glasses; Four-point bending; X-ray diffraction	NI; CRYSTALLIZATION; ALLOYS; EMBRITTLEMENT; DEPOSITION; TOUGHNESS; BEHAVIOR	Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing field aimed to produce high-performance net-shaped parts. Therefore, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), known for their superlative mechanical properties, are of remarkable interest for integration with AM technology. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of commercially available BMG sheetmetal as feedstock for AM, using laser foil printing (LFP) technology. LFP and traditional casting were used to produce samples for four-point bending and Vickers hardness measurements to rigorously compare the mechanical performance of samples resulting from these two fabrication techniques. Through LFP, fully amorphous BMG samples with dimensions larger than the critical casting thickness of the same master alloy were successfully made, while exhibiting high yield strength and toughness in bending. This work exemplifies a potential method to fabricate high-value BMG commercial parts, like gears or mechanisms, where the parts are conventionally machined after printing, and greatly benefit from utilizing novel materials.

Thermoelectric performance of silicon with oxide nanoinclusions	MATERIALS RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Thermal transport; nanoinclusions; plasma synthesis	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BULK ALLOYS; NANOCOMPOSITES; NANOCRYSTALS; SEGREGATION; TRANSPORT; SI	Silicon nanoparticles produced via a plasma-based technique have been sintered into bulk nanostructured samples. These samples have micron-sized crystalline domains and contain well-dispersed oxide nanoinclusions. We have compared the thermoelectric performance of such structure to that of a control sample produced by sintering ball-milled silicon powders. The control sample has lower precipitate density and is composed of nanograins. Despite the stark difference in nanostructure, both samples have comparable thermal conductivity, and the sample with nanoinclusions has higher power factor and ZT. This result confirms that grain size engineering is not the only promising route to achieving improved thermoelectric performance.

Can Airborne Ground Penetrating Radars Explore Groundwater in Hyper-Arid Regions?	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Airborne radar; ground penetrating radar; remote monitoring; water resources; hydrology; soil	FREQUENCY-RANGE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; CROSS-SECTION; WATER-CONTENT; AQUIFER; GPR; PERMITTIVITY; EVAPORATION; SUBSURFACE	Groundwater provides roughly 43% of the water used globally for irrigated agriculture. Understanding, predicting, and managing the environmental processes that define the natural capital of Earth's changing groundwater is one of the most pressing societal challenges of the 21st century. To understand the influence of the dynamics in the vadose zone on terrestrial ecosystems, and to estimate the future sustainability of groundwater resources, a regional and eventually global assessment of water table depth is required. To enable observations of the hydrologic systems' dynamics, the feasibility of an airborne ground penetrating radar (GPR) system is considered as a first step to effectively provide both large spatial coverage and short revisit times. Such a capability has the potential to enable large-scale surveys to directly observe the shallow subsurface hydrologic processes. To evaluate the capabilities of such a system, we start with a review of soil and subsurface material properties, with a focus on hyper-arid regions. Using first principles, results from literature reviews, and recent field measurements, we then investigate the effects of attenuation and surface clutter to identify the potential capabilities and challenges of an airborne GPR to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vadose zone. In this paper, we arrive at a qualified "yes" as an answer the title's question. With low radar frequencies (on the order of 10 MHz or less), adequate ground clutter rejection, and medium or higher vadose zone soil resistivity, the detection of water table depths of 50 m and beyond are feasible.

In this work, we explore the use of 1D photonic bandgap structures integrated directly onto a Si sensor that can operate with solar blindness. These filters take advantage of the improved admittance with silicon to significantly improve throughput over conventional stand-alone bandpass filter elements. At far ultraviolet wavelengths these filters require the use of non-absorbing dielectrics such as the metal fluoride materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. The latest performance of these 1D multilayer filters on Si photodiodes and CCD imaging sensors is demonstrated. We have also extended these 1D structures to more complex multilayers guided by the design concepts of metamaterials and metatronics, and to 2D patterned plasmonic hole array filters fabricated in aluminum. The performance of sensors and test filter structures is presented with an emphasis on UV throughput.

The challenging problems of reliable data delivery and effective mission control that are critical in space explorations are a typical application scenario of the DTN technology. Because space communications must integrate seamlessly with terrestrial communications to support efficient flight operations, DTN is designed as an overlay network architecture; as such, it innately supports the highly heterogeneous networks that will be built on 5G technology. In the absence of reliable underlying links, the reliable data delivery services of DTN rely heavily on the custody transfer feature of its core bundle protocol (BP). Little work has been done in theoretical analysis of the performance of BP custodial transfer in a space communication environment in presence of link disruptions. In this paper, we present a study of BP for reliable data delivery in space communications characterized by multiple link disruption events, accompanied by an extremely long propagation delay and data loss. An analytical model is built to estimate the bundle delivery time and transmission goodput performance of BP for bundle delivery over a space channel in the presence of multiple link disruptions. The model is validated by running data-flow experiments using a testbed infrastructure.

This dream is studied in terms of its image of the walnut tree, rotation about it (the alchemical circulatio), elements of Kundalini yoga (especially a blockage in Uncle Toros's throat), the idea of sacrifice (real vs. psychological), and the Jungian archetypes of the collective unconscious. The problem of identification with evil for the Armenian is raised, along with the need for an Auseinandersetzung (confrontation) through the inner experience of the unconscious with its phantom narratives and healing strength of the feminine.

J	Hendricks, TJ				Hendricks, Terry J.			Heat Exchanger Performance Impacts on Optimum Cost Conditions in Thermoelectric Energy Recovery Designs	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	14th European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT)	SEP 20-23, 2016	Inst Super Tecnico, Alameda Campus, Lisbon, PORTUGAL		Inst Super Tecnico, Alameda Campus	Thermoelectric systems; energy recovery; cost analysis; cost-performannce optimization; heat exchanger effects		Cost is just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste heat recovery thermoelectric generators (TEG). Prior work [1] has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e. g., the $/W value) can be close to the designs that maximize the system's efficiency or power density, however, it is important to understand the relationship between those designs to optimize TEG performance-cost compromises. Expanding on recent work [1, 2, 3] the impact of heat exchanger conditions on the optimum TEG fill factors and cost scaling of a waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator with a detailed treatment of the hot side exhaust heat exchanger has been investigated further. The effect of the heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the hot-side and cold-side conductances [4] that maximize power output are considered. The optimum fill factor to minimize TEG energy recovery system costs is strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, s, the mass flow rate of the exhaust, the hot-side heat exchanger effectiveness, heat exchanger UAh, and heat flux. These relationships are explored and characterized for typical exhaust gas-flow conditions to show the inherent design complexities. The heat exchanger costs often dominate the TEG cost equation and it is critical to fully understand the tradeoff between heat exchanger performance, optimum TEG fill factors, and cost to establish potentially optimum design points within the cost-performance design space. This work will explore the design tradeoffs and relationships within the cost-efficiency-power density design space for a typical thermoelectric energy recovery system application. The interplay between optimum TEG fill factors and heat exchanger design can impact system footprint, volume, and mass in weight-sensitive applications. Less-effective, low-cost heat exchangers may outperform higher cost alternatives from a market adoption perspective. This shift of emphasis acknowledging the interdependence of optimum TEG fill factors and heat exchanger performance has significant implications on thermoelectric waste heat recovery systems designs and their operation. In addition, preferred TEG design regimes exist that accommodate reasonable compromises in TE performance and cost. This effort highlights how the optimum fill factor-heat exchanger performance relations couple to these optimum TEG performance-cost domains based on TEG-system-level analyses and provides a focus for future system research and development efforts.

Many of the same design techniques used at lower frequencies are still applied, but fabrication constraints impose significant limitations on the type of structure that can be used, forcing the designer to consider unique fabrication processes or completely new antenna structures. Through advances in fabrication and computational techniques, the variety of terahertz antennas is growing. This chapter presents a range of antennas applied at these frequencies from 1.9 THz horn antennas to superconducting planar arrays. The chapter will cover different antenna technologies and feeds such as corrugated horn antennas, smooth-walled profiled horn antennas, multi-flare angle horn antennas, lens antennas, microlens leaky wave antennas, metasurface antennas, antenna arrays, off-chip antennas, and others. It will detail theory, simulation, fabrication techniques, and state-of-the-art antenna results in all these different technologies at millimeter and terahertz frequencies. The chapter will also provide details for terahertz antennas in the context of terahertz systems.

The Hydrothermal System and Geothermal Activity	NISYROS VOLCANO: THE KOS - YALI - NISYROS VOLCANIC FIELD	Active Volcanos of the World		English	Article; Book Chapter							FLUID GEOCHEMISTRY; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; NISYROS VOLCANO; FUMAROLIC GAS; AEGEAN ARC; ISLAND; GREECE; CO2; DODECANESE; DISCHARGES	Nisyros volcano's activity is characterized by high seismic unrest, hydrothermal explosions, degassing through fumarolic activity and diffuse degassing structures. Hydrothermal explosions in the caldera floor of unknown age until recently created a complex set of intersecting crater structures with evident structural controls. Low-temperature thermal springs and fumaroles occur along known and inferred fracture systems and their crossing points, springs preferentially along the coast and fumaroles within the caldera and its hydrothermal explosion craters. Their chemical and isotopic signatures reflect phase separation and mixing to varying degrees with magmatic, hydrothermal, meteoric, and seawater components. A deep hot hydrothermal brine with seawater and magmatic influence feeds thermal fluid and gases by vapor separation into a set of intermediate thermal aquifers, which have been explored by drilling. A shallow low-temperature aquifer results from steam condensation and the resulting surface manifestations emit hot steam-gas mixtures at up to boiling temperature. Widespread diffuse degassing of CO2 demonstrates the permeable nature of the Nisyros hydrothermal system, focusing along fault systems, releasing 68 t d(-1) of CO2 and 58 MW of thermal energy. The last magmatic activity of Nisyros, even if of unknown age, is considered relatively old, based on morphological considerations and on the absence of historical magmatic eruptions. Nevertheless, there are many geochemical indications supporting the presence of a magmatic source at depth, which feeds the hydrothermal system. This evidence is mainly constituted by the isotopic composition of H2O, S, and He discharged by the Nisyros fumaroles.

J	Zak, M				Zak, Michail			Modelling 'Life' against 'heat death'	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Entropy; probability; livings; intuition		This work is inspired by the discovery of a new class of dynamical system described by ordinary differential equations coupled with their Liouville equation. These systems called self-controlled since the role of actuators is played by the probability produced by the Liouville equation. Following the Madelung equation that belongs to this class, non-Newtonian properties such as randomness, entanglement and probability interference typical for quantum systems have been described. Special attention was paid to the capability to violate the second law of thermodynamics, which makes these systems neither Newtonian, nor quantum. It has been shown that self-controlled dynamical systems can be linked to mathematical models of living systems. The discovery of isolated dynamical systems that can decrease entropy in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, and resemblances of these systems to livings suggests that 'Life' can slow down the 'heat death' of the Universe and that can be associated with the Purpose of Life.

J	Chen, CW				Chen, Curtis W.			Approach for Modeling Coherent Radar Ground Echoes in Planetary Landing Simulations	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							DESCENT; PERFORMANCE	An approach is proposed for modeling coherent radar echoes from a distributed ground surface in planetary landing simulations. Such simulations pose unique challenges for radar echo modeling given the highly dynamic position and attitude profile that a landing vehicle may follow. The current surface-modeling approach is based on a coherent facet model, with speckle realizations for each cell interpolated from a two-dimensional array of random values, the indices into which are computed from the viewing geometry following the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem. This formulation allows the use of methods for resampling the scene while preserving the continuity of the speckle in the modeled radar echoes. Simulated results are presented, demonstrating that the current approach indeed captures the desired surface correlation properties for use in high-fidelity models of landing radar performance.

This paper outlines the necessary technologies that enable these small satellites to be placed on an interplanetary trajectory. Propulsion is a key aspect of this problem but is only part of it; because a nanospacecraft does not choose its launcher and its injection orbit, launch opportunities and propulsion systems must be considered together. Specifications of present and upcoming electric thrusters and the limits of electric propulsion are described. Especially, the use of such nanothrusters on a nanospacecraft are considered with the realistic constraint of limited thrusting time, which restricts the very large Delta V that can be obtained otherwise. Then, given the present state of rideshare opportunities along scientific or commercial missions, the paper analyzes the possibility of nanospacecraft escaping Earth on their own from common orbits. The paper concludes on technological and system developments required for nanospacecraft to change the paradigm of interplanetary Solar System exploration.

Vortex coronagraphs are a promising solution that performs optimally on off-axis, monolithic telescopes and may also be designed for segmented telescopes with minor losses in performance. We describe the key advantages of vortex coronagraphs on off-axis telescopes such as (1) unwanted diffraction due to aberrations is passively rejected in several low-order Zernike modes relaxing the wavefront stability requirements for imaging Earth-like planets from <10 to >100 pmrms, (2) stars with angular diameters >0.1 lambda/D may be sufficiently suppressed, (3) the absolute planet throughput is >10%, even for unfavorable telescope architectures, and (4) broadband solutions (Delta lambda/lambda > 0.1) are readily available for both monolithic and segmented apertures. The latter make use of grayscale apodizers in an upstream pupil plane to provide suppression of diffracted light from amplitude discontinuities in the telescope pupil without inducing additional stroke on the deformable mirrors. We set wavefront stability requirements on the telescope, based on a stellar irradiance threshold set at an angular separation of 3 +/- 0.5 lambda/D from the star, and discuss how some requirements may be relaxed by trading robustness to aberrations for planet throughput.

Thermoelectric energy recovery is one important technology for recovering this waste thermal energy in high-temperature industrial, transportation and military energy systems. Thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems in these applications require high performance hot-side and cold-side heat exchangers to provide the critical temperature differential and transfer the required thermal energy. High performance hot-side heat exchangers in these systems are often metal-based due to requirements for high-temperature operation, strength at temperature, corrosion resistance, and chemical stability. However, the generally selected metal-based hot-side heat exchangers (i.e., Inconels, Stainless Steels) suffer from low thermal conductivity, high thermal expansion, and high density, which degrades their thermal performance, leads to high thermal-expansion-driven stresses, and creates relatively high mass/high volume (i.e., low power density) TEG systems that are then difficult to fabricate and integrate into viable energy recovery systems. This paper describes the design and testing of a new, high-temperature minichannel graphite heat exchanger designed for operation up to 500 degrees C that is a critical element of a high-power-density TEG power system for aircraft energy recovery. This high-performance graphite heat exchanger represents a new state-of-the-art standard in high-temperature heat exchangers for TEG systems, which provides higher thermal transport, less thermal expansion at operation, lower system level stresses on TE components, and a lighter weight TEG system. This new heat exchanger creates a new design paradigm in TEG system design for terrestrial energy recovery and potential NASA technology infusion into terrestrial energy system applications. This paper will present and discuss the key heat transfer, pressure drop, pumping power analyses and design tradeoffs that created this unique design. Heat transfer and pressure drop modeling was performed with both empirical models based on known heat transfer and friction factor correlations and COMSOL thermal/fluid dynamic modeling of the graphite heat exchanger structure. We will also discuss resulting thermal transport and heat fluxes predicted at the TEG interface level. Heat exchanger performance testing was performed under simulated operating conditions and correlation with test data at the anticipated operating temperature conditions will be presented and discussed.

Relaxation of Alignment Errors and Phase Calibration in Computational Frequency-Diverse Imaging using Phase Retrieval	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Microwaves; imaging; phase retrieval; computational imaging; coherent imaging; phase coherence; phaseless imaging; calibration; frequency-diversity	METAMATERIAL APERTURES; SIMULATION PLATFORM; MICROWAVE; SYSTEM; IMAGER; RADAR	We demonstrate a computational, frequency-diverse, phaseless imaging technique at microwave frequencies that minimizes the impacts of phase calibration and alignment errors on image reconstruction. Phase calibration error is introduced by means of misaligning the sub-antennas forming an aperture, causing unwanted phase shifts between the forward model and adjoint operation. It is shown that by leveraging phase retrieval techniques, distinguishable images can still be reconstructed in the presence of significant phase errors, while complex-based reconstructions those relying on measurement of both phase and amplitude produce heavily corrupted images. Using a frequency-diverse imaging system consisting of a cavity-backed metasurface antenna that operates at microwave frequencies in the K-band (17.5-26.5 GHz), we demonstrate the complex-based and phaseless images of various objects, from a simple subwavelength conducting element to more complex metal structures. We verify that the combination of the phase retrieval approach with the frequency-diverse imager significantly improves the robustness of the composite imaging system to phase errors. While frequency-diverse computational imaging systems have significant advantages in terms of hardware, their reliance on a near-exact forward model places heavy requirements on system calibration. The phase retrieval approach developed here has the potential to alleviate this reliance, increasing the feasibility of such systems.
