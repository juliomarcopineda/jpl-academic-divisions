Measurements of the Ka Band opacity of sulfuric acid vapor with application towards radio occultations of Venus	ICARUS			English	Article						Venus; Radio occultation; Sulfuric acid; Ka Band; Absorption model	LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS; MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; SIMULATED CONDITIONS; DIPOLE-MOMENT; DIOXIDE SO2; ATMOSPHERE; MILLIMETER; ABUNDANCE; PROFILES	Radio occultation experiments are capable of providing insight into the properties of the Venus atmosphere at the boundary between the upper and lower atmosphere. To retrieve vertical profiles of atmospheric gases from Venus radio occultation experiments, accurate models for the absorption of these gases are necessary. New laboratory measurements have been made of the microwave opacity of H2SO4 vapor at Ka Band (30-45 GHz, 6.5-10 mm) in mixtures containing up to 3 bars of CO2 at temperatures ranging from 550 to 585 K, simulating the conditions of the lower atmosphere of Venus. The results of these measurements and prior microwave and millimeter-wavelength laboratory studies have been used to derive a model for H2SO4 vapor opacity valid from 1 to 150 GHz. This model is incorporated into a microwave radiative transfer model of the Venus atmosphere, which has been used to predict the penetration depth of a radio occultation signal at 32 GHz and determine the contributions of atmospheric gases to 32 GHz opacity. These results can be used to interpret signal attenuation profiles for future Ka Band radio occultations of Venus.

Deep-ultraviolet Raman spectra of Mars-relevant evaporite minerals under 248.6 nm excitation	ICARUS			English	Article						Mineralogy; Deep-UV Raman spectroscopy; Mars; Evaporites; Mineral spectroscopy	CARBONATE; SPECTROSCOPY; BORATE; ABSORPTION; SEARCH; ROCKS	We have measured the deep-ultraviolet (DUV) Raman spectra of a number of evaporite minerals that are relevant to lacustrine and fluvial environments found on Earth and Mars, and show that DUV Raman can provide detailed information on elemental composition and crystal structure. The minerals included three borates, eight carbonates, and seven sulfates, with each class of mineral exhibited very distinct spectra under 248.6 nm excitation, dominated by the various internal vibrations of the borate, carbonate or sulfate oxyanion. Peak positions were shifted by markedly lower wavenumbers vs positions reported in the literature for longer wavelengths, a phenomenon we ascribe to the effect of pre-resonance with the oxyanion. Within each class, minerals consisting different metallic cations could be distinguished by the position of the dominant vibrational mode and the relative intensities of the minor modes, ascribed to the electrostatic impact of the cation on the vibrational behavior of the oxyanion. There was also evidence that DUV Raman can reveal minor metallic components even if they are not apparent in XRD, as two of three calcite (CaCO3) samples exhibited a shoulder on the dominant peak consistent with perturbation by similar to 19% Mg. UV absorption by Fe2+/3+ was a major factor in determining measurable signal, with Fe-rich minerals exhibiting weak/undetectable spectra. Understanding the spectra of these evaporite minerals will be essential to interpreting and identifying complex mineral samples using this technique, and represents an important addition to the spectral standards library of DUV Raman spectroscopy.

Microstructural dependence of the incipient to homogeneous flow transition in metallic glass composites	SCRIPTA MATERIALIA			English	Article						Metallic glass composites; Yield criteria; Shear localization; Flow transition	MATRIX COMPOSITES; PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; SERRATED FLOW; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SHEAR BANDS; TENSILE; INDENTATION; DUCTILITY; BEHAVIOR; NANOINDENTATION	As ductile derivatives of amorphous alloys, metallic glass composites balance high strength with the ability to mitigate catastrophic shear localization, which has long plagued monolithic metallic glasses. In this study, we employ a bonded-interface indentation technique coupled with strain field mapping to identify the governing yield criterion in metallic glass composites as a function of their microstructural length scales. A crossover from the shear plane to maximum shear stress yield criterion is uncovered at a crystalline fraction of approximately 60%, thus signaling an effective transition from incipient to homogeneous flow as the dominant deformation mode of the composite microstructure.

A look back, part II: The drilling campaign of the Curiosity rover during the Mars Science Laboratory's second and third martian years	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Instrumentation; Mars, surface; Prebiotic environments	GALE CRATER; K-AR; SANDSTONE; MUDSTONE; MINERALOGY; KIMBERLEY; CHEMCAM	The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity, completed its second Martian year, 1337 sols (1374 Earth days), of operation on May 11, 2016, and its third Martian year, 2006 sols (2061 Earth days), of operation on March 28, 2018. During this time the rover successfully drilled twelve full depth drill holes into the Martian surface and analyzed the recovered material using onboard instruments, giving us new insights into the potential habitability and geologic diversity of ancient Mars. During the second Martian year, four holes were drilled into the mudstones of the Murray formation: 'Confidence Hills' (Sol 759), 'Mojave 2' (Sol 882), 'Telegraph Peak' (908) & 'Buckskin' (Sol 1060); while four more holes were drilled into the sandstones of the Stimson formation: 'Big Sky' (Sol 1119), 'Greenhorn' (Sol 1137), 'Lubango' (Sol 1320) & 'Okoruso' (Sol 1332). During the third Martian year, four additional holes were drilled into the Murray formation: 'Oudam' (Sol 1361), 'Marimba' (Sol 1422), 'Quela' (Sol 1464) & 'Sebina' (Sol 1495). In this paper, we will give a brief overview of the rover sampling hardware and nominal drilling protocols, followed by a discussion of how these protocols were refined and altered early during the course of Curiosity's second year on Mars. In addition, we will describe the 'Bonanza King' (Sol 724) drill campaign, the mission's first 'successful failure', and how it influenced these changes. We will also briefly discuss the events leading up to the drill feed fault on Sol 1536, which resulted in suspension of all drill activities for the remainder of the third Martian year. Finally, we will present scientific highlights obtained from each drill site utilizing MSL's onboard instrumentation (SAM & CheMin), results enabled by the drill's ability to excavate sample at depth and transfer it to these instruments.

Vertically-resolved observations of Jupiter's quasi-quadrennial oscillation from 2012 to 2019	ICARUS			English	Article						Jupiter; Atmospheres; Structure; Infrared observations; Spectroscopy	ROTOTRANSLATIONAL ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; PLANETARY-SCALE DISTURBANCE; EQUATORIAL OSCILLATION; BIENNIAL OSCILLATION; TEMPERATURES; JET; DISRUPTION; RESOLUTION	Over the last eight years, a rich dataset of mid-infrared CH4 observations from the TEXES instrument at IRTF has been used to characterize the thermal evolution of Jupiter's stratosphere. These data were used to produce vertically-resolved temperature maps between latitudes of 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N, allowing us to track approximately two periods of Jupiter's quasi-quadrennial oscillation (QQO). During the first five years of observations, the QQO has a smooth sinusoidal pattern with a period of 4.0 +/- 0.2 years and an amplitude of 7 +/- 1 K at 13.5 mbar (our region of maximum sensitivity). In 2017, we note an abrupt change to this pattern, with the phase being shifted backwards by similar to 1 year. Searching for possible causes of this QQO delay, we investigated the TEXES zonally-resolved temperature retrievals and found that in May/June 2017, there was an unusually warm thermal anomaly located at a latitude of 28 degrees N and a pressure of 1.2 mbar, moving westward with a velocity of 19 +/- 4 ms(-1). We suggest that there may be a link between these two events.	[Giles, R. S.; Greathouse, T. K.] Southwest Res Inst, San Antonio, TX 78238 USA; [Cosentino, R.

J	Morellina, S; Bellan, J; Cutts, J				Morellina, Stefano; Bellan, Josette; Cutts, James			Global thermodynamic, transport-property and dynamic characteristics of the Venus lower atmosphere below the cloud layer	ICARUS			English	Article						Venus; Venus atmosphere; Venus atmosphere thermodynamics; Venus speed of sound; Venus viscosity and thermal conductivity	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; PRESSURE; SURFACE; CO2	This study investigates the global characteristics of the Venus lower atmosphere below the cloud layer. Starting from available data regarding species composition, temperature and pressure, the general thermodynamic and transport properties of the Venus lower atmosphere are first computed at altitudes below the cloud layer. The thermodynamic and transport properties are validated with known data. A thermodynamic stability analysis for a variety of potentially existing mixtures is conducted to highlight the sensitivity of the thermodynamic regime to the variation of the species molar fractions. The limits of thermodynamic stability are represented in the thermodynamic phase diagram of the mixture, and thus regions of phase stability and instability are determined. It is found that the Venus lower-atmosphere thermodynamic regime is located in the stable, single-phase regime, with supercritical conditions occurring in the lower few kilometers, thereby validating ad-hoc expectations which have never envisaged the existence of a two-phase regime at those altitudes. Using thermodynamic and transport-property information thus computed, several non-dimensional numbers are calculated. The Prandtl number is first evaluated. Then, the characteristic Reynolds number is estimated for different assumed length scales, showing that, independent of the length scale, the entire lower atmosphere below the cloud deck is in a fully-turbulent flow regime. Finally, the speed of sound and the Mach number are computed as function of altitude. The information obtained from all these calculations fills a scientific void, and may be crucial for the design of landers on the Venus surface.

Constraints on Neptune's haze structure and formation from VLT observations in the H-band	ICARUS			English	Article						Neptune; Haze microphysics; Radiative transfer	ABSORPTION-SPECTRA; STRATOSPHERIC HAZE; CLOUD STRUCTURE; OVERTONE BAND; TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERE; URANUS; MODEL; PAIRS; PHOTOCHEMISTRY	A 1-dimensional microphysics model has been used to constrain the structure and formation of haze in Neptune's atmosphere. These simulations were coupled to a radiative-transfer and retrieval code (NEMESIS) to model spectral observations of Neptune in the H-band performed by the SINFONI Integral Field Unit Spectrometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in 2013. It was found that observations in the H-band and with emission angles <= 60 degrees are largely unaffected by the imaginary refractive index of haze particles, allowing a notable reduction of the free parameters required to fit the observations. Our analysis shows a total haze production rate of (2.61 +/- 0.18) x 10(-14) kg m(-2) s(-1), about 10 times larger than that found in Uranus's atmosphere, and a particle electric charge of q = 8.6 +/- 1.1 electrons per mu m radius at latitudes between 5 and 15 degrees S. This haze production rate in Neptune results in haze optical depths about 10 times greater than those in Uranus. The effective radius r(eff) was found to be 0.22 +/- 0.01 and 0.26 +/- 0.02 mu m at the 0.1 and 1-bar levels, respectively, with haze number densities of 8.48(+1.78)(-1.31) and 9.31(+2.52)(-1.91) particles per cm(3). The fit at weak methane-absorbing wavelengths reveals also the presence of a tropospheric cloud with a total optical depth >10 at 1.46 mu m. The tropospheric cloud base altitude was found near the 2.5-bar level, although this estimation may be only representative of the top of a thicker and deeper cloud. Our analysis leads to haze opacities about 3.5 times larger than that derived from Voyager-2 observations (Moses et al., 1995). This larger opacity indicates a haze production rate 2 times larger at least. To study this difference haze opacity or production rate, we performed a timescale analysis with our microphysical model to estimate the time required for haze particles to grow and settle out. Although this analysis shows haze timescales (similar to 15 years) shorter than the time lapsed between Voyager-2 observations and 2013, the solar illumination at the top of the atmosphere has not varied significantly during this period (at the studied latitudes) to explain the increase in haze production. This difference in haze production rate derived for these two periods may arise from: a) the fact that in our analysis we employed spectral observations in the infrared (H-band), while Moses et al. (1995) used photometric images taken at 5 different filters in the visible. While high-phase-angle Voyager observations are more sensitive to small haze particles and at altitudes above the 0.1-bar level, the haze constraints derived from VLT spectra in H-band are limited to pressures greater than 0.1 bar. As a result of the different phase angles of the two set of observations, differences in the estimation of M-0 may arise from the use of Mie phase functions as well. b) our 1-dimensional model does not account for latitudinal redistributions of the haze by dynamics. A possible meridional transport of haze with wind velocities greater than similar to 0.03 m s(-1) would result in dynamics timescales shorter than 15 years and thus might explain the observed variations in the haze production rate during this period. Compared with our estimations, photochemical models point to even larger production rates on Neptune (by a factor of 2.4). Assuming that the photochemical simulations are correct, we found that this discrepancy can be explained if haze particles evaporate before reaching the tropospheric-cloud levels. This scenario would decrease the cumulative haze opacity above the 1-bar level, and thus a larger haze production rate would be required to fit our observations. However, to validate this haze vertical structure future microphysical simulations that include the evaporation rates of haze particles are required.	[Toledo, Daniel; Irwin, Patrick G.

J	Watkins, JA; Ehlmann, BL; Yin, A				Watkins, Jessica A.; Ehlmann, Bethany L.; Yin, An			Spatiotemporal evolution, mineralogical composition, and transport mechanisms of long-runout landslides in Valles Marineris, Mars	ICARUS			English	Article						Landslides; Morphology; Geological processes; Hydrated minerals; Mars	ACOUSTIC FLUIDIZATION; SILICATE MINERALS; ROCK AVALANCHES; MASS MOVEMENTS; DEBRIS FLOWS; MOBILITY; ORIGIN; WATER; ICE; STURZSTROMS	Long-runout landslides with transport distances of >50 km are ubiquitous in Valles Marineris (VM), yet the transport mechanisms remain poorly understood. Four decades of studies reveal significant variation in landslide morphology and emplacement age, but how these variations are related to landslide transport mechanisms is not clear. In this study, we address this question by conducting systematic geological mapping and compositional analysis of VM long-runout landslides using high-resolution Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter imagery and spectral data. Our work shows that: (1) a two-zone morphological division (i.e., an inner zone characterized by rotated blocks and an outer zone expressed by a thin sheet with a nearly flat surface) characterizes all major VM landslides; (2) landslide mobility is broadly dependent on landslide mass; and (3) the maximum width of the outer zone and its transport distance are inversely related to the basal friction that was estimated from the surface slope angle of the outer zone. Our comprehensive Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) compositional analysis indicates that hydrated silicates are common in landslide outer zones and nearby trough-floor deposits. Furthermore, outer zones containing hydrated minerals are sometimes associated with longer runout and increased lateral spreading compared to those without detectable hydrated minerals. Finally, with one exception we find that hydrated minerals are absent in the inner zones of the investigated VM landslides. These results as whole suggest that hydrated minerals may have contributed to the magnitude of lateral spreading and long-distance forward transport of major VM landslides.

Sharp") in Gale crater, Mars. They were observed in HiRISE images acquired from orbit prior to the landing of the Curiosity rover. The rover was used to investigate three of these units named Blackfoot, Brandberg, and Bimbe between sols 1099 and 1410. These unconsolidated units overlie the lower Murray formation that forms the base of Mt. Sharp, and consist of pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Blackfoot also overlies portions of the Stimson formation, which consists of eolian sandstone that is understood to significantly postdate the dominantly lacustrine deposition of the Murray formation. Blackfoot is elliptical in shape (62 x 26 m), while Brandberg is nearly circular (50 x 55 m), and Bimbe is irregular in shape, covering about ten times the area of the other two. The largest boulders are 1.5-2.5 m in size and are interpreted to be sandstones. As seen from orbit, some boulders are light-toned and others are dark-toned. Rover-based observations show that both have the same gray appearance from the ground and their apparently different albedos in orbital observations result from relatively flat skyfacing surfaces. Chemical observations show that two clasts of fine sandstone at Bimbe have similar compositions and morphologies to nine ChemCam targets observed early in the mission, near Yellowknife Bay, including the Bathurst Inlet outcrop, and to at least one target (Pyramid Hills, Sol 692) and possibly a cap rock unit just north of Hidden Valley, locations that are several kilometers apart in distance and tens of meters in elevation. These findings may suggest the earlier existence of draping strata, like the Stimson formation, that would have overlain the current surface from Bimbe to Yellowknife Bay. Compositionally these extinct strata could be related to the Siccar Point group to which the Stimson formation belongs. Dark, massive sandstone blocks at Bimbe are chemically distinct from blocks of similar morphology at Bradbury Rise, except for a single float block, Oscar (Sol 516). Conglomerates observed along a low, sinuous ridge at Bimbe consist of matrix and clasts with compositions similar to the Stimson formation, suggesting that stream beds likely existed nearly contemporaneously with the dunes that eventually formed the Stimson formation, or that they had the same source material. In either case, they represent a later pulse of fluvial activity relative to the lakes associated with the Murray formation. These three units may be local remnants of infilled impact craters (especially circular-shaped Brandberg), decayed buttes, patches of unconsolidated fluvial deposits, or residual mass-movement debris. Their incorporation of Stimson and Murray rocks, the lack of lithification, and appearance of being erosional remnants suggest that they record erosion and deposition events that post-date the exposure of the Stimson formation.

On-board terrain classification using visual information has limitations, and is sensitive to illumination conditions. Classification can be improved if one fuses visual imagery with additional infrared (IR) imagery of the scene, yet unfortunately there are no IR image sensors on the current Mars rovers. A virtual IR sensor, estimating IR from RGB imagery using deep learning, was proposed in the context of a MU-Net architecture. However, virtual IR estimation was limited by the fact that slope angle variations induce temperature differences within the same terrain. This paper removes this limitation, giving good IR estimates and as a consequence improving terrain classification by including the additional angle from the surface normal to the Sun and the measurement of solar radiation. The estimates are also useful when estimating thermal inertia, which can enhance slip prediction and small rock density estimation. Our approach is demonstrated in two applications. We collected a new data set to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show its benefit by applying to the two applications.

These robots have a variety of applications ranging from search and rescue to agriculture. Although one of the main advantages of spherical robots is their capability to operate on uneven surfaces, energy analysis and path planning of such systems have been studied only for flat terrains. This work introduces a novel approach to evaluate the dynamic equations, energy consumption, and separation analysis of these robots rolling on uneven terrains. The presented dynamics modeling, separation analysis, and energy analysis allow us to implement path planning algorithms to find an optimal path. One of the advantages of this work is that these algorithms can be used when either the analytical or the empirical information about the terrain is available.

This enables study of long-term, variable phenomena such as the seismicity of Venus and near surface weather, near surface energy balance, and atmospheric chemical composition. SAEVe also serves as a critical pathfinder for more sophisticated landers in the future. For example, first order seismic measurements by SAEVe will allow future missions to deliver better seismometers and systems to support the yet unknown frequency and magnitude of Venus events. SAEVe is focused on science that can be realized with low data volume instruments and will most benefit from temporal operations. The entire mission architecture and operations maximize science while minimizing energy usage and physical size and mass. The entire SAEVe system including its protective entry system is estimated to be around 45 kg and approximately 0.6 m diameter. These features allow SAEVe to be relatively cost effective and be easily integrated onto a Venus orbiter mission. The technologies needed to implement SAEVe are currently in development by several funded activities. Component and system level work is ongoing under NASA's Long Lived Insitu Solar System Explorer (LLISSE) project and the HOTTech program. LLISSE, is a NASA project to develop a small Venus lander that will operate on the surface of Venus for 60 days and measure variations in meteorology, radiance, and atmospheric chemistry. LLISSE is developing a full-function engineering model of a Venus lander that contains essentially all the core capabilities of SAEVe thus greatly reducing the technology risk to SAEVe. The SAEVe long duration Venus lander promises exciting new science and is an ideal complimentary element to many future Venus orbiter missions being proposed or planned today.

The introduced framework allows us to consider the nonlinear dynamics of MAVs, nonlinear geometric constraints, while guarantees real-time performance. Our first contribution is to reveal underlying planes within a 3D point cloud, obtained from a 3D lidar scanner, by designing an efficient subspace clustering method. The second contribution is to incorporate the extracted information into the nonlinear constraints of NMPC for avoiding collisions. Our third contribution focuses on making the controller robust by considering the uncertainty of localization in NMPC using Shannon's entropy to define the weights involved in the optimization process. This strategy enables us to track position or velocity references or none in the event of losing track of position or velocity estimations. As a result, the collision avoidance constraints are defined in the local coordinates of the MAV and it remains active and guarantees collision avoidance, despite localization uncertainties, e.g., position estimation drifts. The efficacy of the suggested framework has been evaluated using various simulations in the Gazebo environment.

The proposed NMPC formulation allows for a fully parametric obstacle trajectory, while in this letter we apply a classification scheme to differentiate between different kinds of trajectories to predict future obstacle positions. The trajectory calculation is done from an initial condition, and fed to the NMPC as an additional input. The solver used is the nonlinear, non-convex solver Proximal Averaged Newton for Optimal Control (PANOC) and its associated software OpEn (Optimization Engine), in which we apply a penalty method to properly consider the obstacles and other constraints during navigation. The proposed NMPC scheme allows for real-time solutions using a sampling time of 50 ms and a two second prediction of both the obstacle trajectory and the NMPC problem, which implies that the scheme can be considered as a local path-planner. This letter will present the NMPC cost function and constraint formulation, as well as the methodology of dealing with the dynamic obstacles. We include multiple laboratory experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control architecture, and to show that the proposed method delivers fast and computationally stable solutions to the dynamic obstacle avoidance scenarios.

The target is the smaller component of the binary asteroid 65,803 Didymos. We have conducted high-fidelity rigid full two-body simulations of the mutual dynamics of this system in a broad benchmarking exercise to find the best simulation methodologies, and to understand the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. Due to the non-spherical shapes of the components and their close proximity, the components cannot be treated as point masses and so the dynamics differ significantly from a simple Keplerian orbit, necessitating the use of numerical simulations to fully capture the system's dynamics. We find that the orbit phase (angular position or true anomaly) of the secondary is highly sensitive to the initial rotation phase of the primary, making prediction of the secondary's location from numerical simulation challenging. Finally, we show that the DART impact should induce significant free and forced librations on the secondary. If this libration can be measured by ESA's recently approved follow-up spacecraft, Hera, it may be possible to constrain properties of the secondary's interior structure.

We have carried out a detailed investigation of the photometric behavior at several key wavelengths (1.35, 1.5, 1.65, 1.8, 2.0, 2.25, 2.55 and 3.6 mu m), characteristics of the infrared spectra of water ice. We propose a new photometric function, based on the model of Shkuratov et al. (2011). When combined, corrected mosaics at different wavelengths reveal heterogeneous areas, in particular in the terrains surrounding the Tiger Stripes on the South Pole and in the northern hemisphere around 30 degrees N, 90 degrees W. Those areas appear mainly correlated to tectonized units, indicating an endogenous origin, potentially driven by seafloor hotspots.

However, current constraints on the ocean composition need to rely largely on its expression on the surface. In this work, we combine chemical divide modeling with cryogenic Raman and X-ray diffraction experiments to examine freezing of a simple putative brine system containing Nathorn, Mg2+, Cl, and SO42 across a range of ionic concentrations and freezing rates to assess the feasibility of inferring the ocean's chemical composition via in-situ techniques. The results suggest that multiple hydrated salts not predicted by chemical models are frequently encountered in the final solid phase, making accurate quantification of the subsurface liquid composition via surface observables rather challenging. In addition, flash freezing of diluted brines often produces water ice together with vitreous Mg-bearing salt hydrates, which may significantly hinder their detection. These findings can help inform both analytical protocols for a Raman spectrometer onboard a Europa surface lander as well as potential locations for exploration, in order to best provide meaningful constraints on emplacement mechanisms and the composition of frozen salt minerals on the surface.

Radiation effects on lithium CFX batteries for future spacecraft and landers	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						CFX; Radiation effects; Primary battery	HEAT; SURFACE; CATHODE; ENERGY; CELLS	Future landers to the moons of the outer planets could be powered by higher specific energy primary batteries. Batteries based on lithium carbon monofluoride (Li/CFX) provide similar to 50% higher specific energy than heritage cells (Li/SO2 or Li/SOCl2) in relevant conditions. Radiation tolerance is a major concern due to the high radiation environment surrounding Jupiter and its moons. Gamma radiation exposure may also become the sterilization (a critical step for any lander to planetary bodies where life may survive) technique of choice because the alternative thermal technique (prolonged exposure to high temperature) results in significant capacity loss for Li/CFX cells. Several D-sized Li/CFX and Li/CFX-MnO2 cells have been exposed to gamma radiation from a Co-60 source. The energy and capacity of the cells decreased by less than 2% following radiation and trends regarding the open circuit voltage and impedance spectroscopy are reported. To better understand the effects of radiation, samples of individual materials have been exposed to radiation as well as three-electrode cylindrical Li/CFX cells. These component-level tests, along with the experimental cell tests, reveal that the electrolyte/electrode interaction in a full cell is the likely cause of increased impedance and decreased energy/capacity, following exposure to ionizing radiation.

We show that the mechanical frequency of the particle oscillation is independent on the particle properties and is proportional to the free fall acceleration constant, similarly to the classical mechanical pendulum. The frequency can be used to measure the gravity field. The eddy-current induced attenuation constant does not depend on the mass of the particle and reduces with the particle volume. The quality factor of the mechanical motion can be as high as 10(9) and is comparable with the attenuation due to interaction of the particle with incompletely evacuated air. A possibility of usage of the particle as a quantum mechanical system is discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper investigates to what extent it is possible to retrieve structural parameters of two different parameterization schemes from direct transmittance derived from digital hemispherical photography and 3D radiative transfer modeling for two study sites with different vegetation canopy architectures. Neglecting the representation of 3D canopy structure in radiative transfer schemes leads to significant errors in shortwave radiation partitioning (up to 3.5 times more direct transmittance in the 3D model). Structural parameters, referred to as whole canopy 'clumping indices', were obtained in order to evaluate the impact of angular variation in clumping on shortwave radiation transfer. Impacts on photosynthesis were evaluated at site level with the UKESM land surface model, JULES. A comparison between flux tower derived and modeled photosynthesis indicates that considering zenith angular variations of structural parameters in the radiative transfer scheme of the UKESM land surface model significantly improves photosynthesis prediction in light limited ecosystems (from RMSE = 2.91 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1) to RMSE = 1.51 mu mol CO2.m(-2).s(-1), 48% smaller), typically with enhanced photosynthesis from bottom layers.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						River hydrology; Radar interferometry	SATELLITE IMAGERY; WIDTH	Water surface elevation (WSE), slope and width measurements from the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will enable spaceborne estimates of global river discharge. WSE will be measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). InSAR measurements are vulnerable to contamination from layover, a phenomenon wherein radar returns from multiple locations arrive at the sensor simultaneously, rendering them indistinguishable. This study assesses whether layover will significantly impact the precision of SWOT estimates of global river discharge. We present a theoretical river layover uncertainty model at the scale of nodes and reaches, which constitute nominal 200 m and 10 km averages, respectively, along river centerlines. The model is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of SWOT radar interaction with topography covering a total of 41,233 node observations, across a wide range of near-river topographic features. We find that height uncertainty increases to a maximum value at relatively low values of topographic standard deviation and varies strongly with position in the swath. When applied at global scale, the calibrated model shows that layover causes expected height uncertainty to increase by only a modest amount (from 9.4 to 10.4 cm at the 68th percentile). The 68th percentile of the slope uncertainty increases more significantly, from 10 to 17 mm/km. Nonetheless, the 68th percentile discharge uncertainty increases only marginally. We find that the impact of layover on SWOT river discharge is expected to be small in most environments.

Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.9 +/- 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 +/- 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R-2 (+/- standard deviation) and RMSE (+/- standard deviation) of 0.8 (+/- 0.05) and 0.22 (+/- 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman's Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R-2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.

Quantifying uncertainty for remote spectroscopy of surface composition	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Imaging spectroscopy; Geologic mapping; Cuprite Nevada; Calibration visible-shortwave infrared; Atmospheric correction; Statistical methods; Hyperspectral imagers	IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS; REFLECTANCE; RETRIEVAL; PRODUCTS; WATER; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOMETRY; VEGETATION; CUPRITE	Remote surface measurements by imaging spectrometers play an important role in planetary and Earth science. To make these measurements, investigators calibrate instrument data to absolute units, invert physical models to estimate atmospheric effects, and then determine surface properties from the spectral reflectance. This study quantifies the uncertainty in this process. Global missions demand predictive uncertainty models that can estimate future errors for varied environments and observing conditions. Here we validate uncertainty predictions with remote surface composition retrievals and in situ measurements in a field analogue of Earth and planetary exploration. We consider rover transects at Cuprite, Nevada, and remote observations by NASA's NextGeneration Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG). We show that accounting for input uncertainties can benefit mineral detection methods such as constrained spectrum fitting. This suggests that operational uncertainty estimates could improve future NASA missions like the Earth Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) and the Lunar Trailblazer mission, as well as NASA's Decadal Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) Investigation.

However, due to sparse ground measurements, the changes of frozen soil and the environmental controls over the vast cryosphere are still unclear, such as in the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, a process-based model solely driven by satellite remote sensing data is employed to investigate the spatiotemporal changes of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost over the entire TP (similar to 3 million km(2)) during 2002-2016 at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Comprehensive validations against in situ observations of frozen ground types, mean annual ground temperature, active layer thickness, soil temperature, and frozen depth at 608 boreholes and 109 meteorological stations demonstrate an overall satisfactory performance of the model in reproducing the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of the frozen soil in the region. Spatially, land surface temperature (LST; both in-season and off-season) primarily controls the frozen ground types and frozen depth, with seasonally frozen ground and permafrost covering similar to 56% and similar to 37% of the plateau, respectively. The estimated spatial-averaged annual maximum soil freeze depth (SFD) is similar to 1.29 m, and the annual maximum active layer thickness (ALT) of permafrost is similar to 1.85 m. Temporally, ALT shows an overall increasing trend at an average rate of +3.17 cm yr(-1), while SFD exhibits both decreasing (at similar to 62% areas) and increasing (at similar to 38% areas) trends in the region. Again, LST is found to be the dominant factor that controls the temporal changes in both SFD and ALT while precipitation (i.e., both rainfall and snowfall) plays an important (especially in more arid areas and regions near the lower limit of permafrost) but secondary role. Our results demonstrate the advantages of the satellite-based method in frozen soil simulations over large scales with complex topography and landscape and highlight the important roles of both temperature and precipitation in shaping the frozen soil patterns on the TP or other cold, dry regions.

J	Howett, CJA; Spencer, JR; Nordheim, TA				Howett, C. J. A.; Spencer, J. R.; Nordheim, T. A.			Bolometric bond albedo and thermal inertia maps of Mimas	ICARUS			English	Article						Satellites, surfaces; Saturn, satellites; Satellites, general	ORIGIN; RING	In 2011 a thermally anomalous region was discovered on Mimas, Saturn's innermost major icy satellite (I tow(at et al., 2011). The anomalous region is a lens-like shape located at low latitudes on Mimas' leading hemisphere. It manifests as a region with warmer nighttime temperatures, and cooler daytime ones than its surroundings. The thermally anomalous region is spatially correlated with a darkening in Mimas' IR/UV surface color (Schcnk et al., 2011) and the region preferentially bombarded by high-energy electrons (Paranicaa el al., 2012, 2014; Nordheim (tai., 2017). We use data from Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) to map Mimas' surface temperatures and its thermophysical properties. This provides a dramatic improvement on the work in Homiett el al. 52011), where the values were determined at only two regions on Mimas (one inside, and another outside of the anomalous region). We use all spatially-resolved scans made by CIRS' focal plane 3 (FP3, 600 to 1100 cm 1) of Mimas' surface, which are largely daytime observations but do include one nighttime one. The resulting temperature maps confirm the presence and location of Mimas' previously discovered thermally anomalous region. No other thermally anomalous regions were discovered, although we note that the surface coverage is incomplete on Mimas' leading and anti-Saturn hemisphere. The thermal inertia map confirms that the anomalous region has a notably higher thermal inertia than its surroundings: 98 + 42 J m(-2) K-1 S-1/2 inside of the anomaly, compared to 34 + 32 J M-2 K-1 s(-1/2) outside. The albedo inside and outside of the anomalous region agrees within their uncertainty: 0.45 + 0.08 inside compared to 0.41 + 0.07 outside the anomaly. Interestingly the albedo appears brighter inside the anomaly region, which may not be surprising given this region does appear brighter at some UV wavelengths (0.338 um, see 5, heal; el al., 2011). However, this result should be treated with caution because, as previously stated, statistically the albedo of these two regions is the same when their uncertainties are considered. These thermal inertia and albedo values determined here are consistent with those found by Ilowett el al (2011), who determined the thermal inertia inside the anomaly to be 66 + 23 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) and <16 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) outside, with albedos that varied from 0.49 to 0.70.

Radar observations and a physical model of binary near-Earth asteroid 65803 Didymos, target of the DART mission	ICARUS			English	Article						Satellites of asteroids; Radar observations; Near-Earth objects; Asteroids	FAILURE; IMPACT	Near-Earth asteroid Didymos is a binary system and the target of the proposed Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission (Chong et al., 201e), which is a planetary defense experiment. The DART spacecraft will impact the satellite, causing changes in the binary orbit that will be measured by Earth-based observers. We observed Didymos using the planetary radars at Arecibo (2380 MHz, 12.6 cm) and Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) in November 2003. Delay-Doppler radar imaging of the binary system provided range resolutions of up to 15 m/ pixel that placed hundreds of pixels on the primary. We used the radar data to estimate a 3D shape model and spin state for the primary, the secondary size and spin, the mutual orbit parameters, and the radar scattering properties of the binary system. We included lightcurves obtained by Pravec et al. (200e) in the shape model estimation. The primary is top-shaped with an equatorial bulge, a conspicuous facet along the equator, and a volume-equivalent diameter of 780 +/- 30 m. The extents along the three principal axes are 832 m, 838 m, and 786 m, (uncertainties are 6% along the x and y axes, and 10% along the z axis). The radar data do not provide complete rotational coverage of the secondary but show visible extents of about 75 m, implying a diameter of 150 +/- 30 m. The bandwidth of the secondary in the images suggests a spin period of 12.4 +/- 3.0 h that is consistent with rotation that is synchronized with the mutual orbit period of 11.9 h. We fit a mutual orbit to the system using the delay and Doppler separations between the binary components and obtain a semimajor axis of 1190 +/- 30 m, an eccentricity of <0.05, and an orbital period of 11.93 +/- 0.01 h that are consistent with those obtained by Sc heitit h and Prase (2009) and kg and Margot (2012). The mutual orbit implies a system mass of (5.4 + 0.4) x 10(11) kg and a system bulk density of 2170 +/- 350 kg m(-3). The system has S- and X-band radar albedos of 0.20 +/- 0.05 and 0.30 +/- 0.08 respectively, and an optical albedo of 0.15 +/- 0.04.	[Naidu, S. P.; Benner, L. A. M.; Brozovic, M.; Ostro, S.

Challenges with manufacturing the material from the melt has previously limited the processing of Al 7075 via welding, casting, and additive manufacturing. Recent research has shown the capabilities of nanoparticle additives to control the solidification behavior of high-strength aluminum alloys, showcasing the first Al 7075 components processed via casting, welding, and AM. In this work, the properties of nanoparticle-enhanced aluminum 7075 are investigated on welded parts, overlays and through wire-based additive manufacturing. The hardness and tensile strength of the deposited materials were measured in the as-welded and T73 heat-treated conditions showing that the properties of Al 7075 T73 can be recovered in welded and layer-deposited parts. The work shows that Al 7075 now has the potential to be conventionally welded or additively manufactured from wire into high-strength, crack-free parts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We found that the inner mini-Neptune, TOI-421 b, has an orbital period of P-b = 5.19672 +/- 0.00049 days, a mass of M-b = 7.17 +/- 0.66 M-circle plus, and a radius of R-b = R-circle plus, whereas the outer warm Neptune, TOI-421 c, has a period of P-c = 16.06819 +/- 0.00035 days, a mass of M-c = 16.42(-1.04)(+1.06)M(circle plus), a radius of R-c = 5.09(-0.15)(+0.16)R(circle plus), and a density of rho(c) = 0.685(-0.072)(+0.080) cm(-3). With its characteristics, the outer planet (rho(c) = 0.685(-0.0072)(+0.080) cm(-3)) is placed in the intriguing class of the super-puffy mini-Neptunes. TOI-421 b and TOI-421 c are found to be well-suited for atmospheric characterization. Our atmospheric simulations predict significant Ly alpha transit absorption, due to strong hydrogen escape in both planets, as well as the presence of detectable CH4 in the atmosphere of TOI-421 c if equilibrium chemistry is assumed.

A High Angular Resolution Survey of Massive Stars in Cygnus OB2: JHK Adaptive Optics Results from the Gemini Near-Infrared Imager	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Massive stars; Early-type stars; Wide binary stars; OB associations; OB stars	PHOTOMETRY; MULTIPLICITY; BINARIES; FRAGMENTATION; EVOLUTION; CATALOG; DESIGN; SYSTEM	We present results of a high angular resolution survey of massive OB stars in the Cygnus OB2 association that we conducted with the Near-Infrared Imager camera and ALTAIR adaptive optics system of the Gemini North telescope. We observed 74 O- and early-B-type stars in Cyg OB2 in the JHK infrared bands in order to detect binary and multiple companions. The observations are sensitive to equal-brightness pairs at separations as small as 0 ''.08, and progressively fainter companions are detectable out to Delta K = 9 mag at a separation of 2 ''. This faint contrast limit due to read noise continues out to 10 '' near the edge of the detector. We assigned a simple probability of chance alignment to each companion based upon its separation and magnitude difference from the central target star and upon areal star counts for the general star field of Cyg.OB2. Companion stars with a field membership probability of less than 1% are assumed to be physical companions. This assessment indicates that 47% of the targets have at least one resolved companion that is probably gravitationally bound. Including known spectroscopic binaries, our sample includes 27 binary, 12 triple, and 9 systems with 4 or more components. These results confirm studies of high-mass stars in other environments that find that massive stars are born with a high-multiplicity fraction. The results are important for the placement of the stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the interpretation of their spectroscopic analyses, and for future mass determinations through measurement of orbital motion.

Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope Observations of 2012 Solar Eclipse: A Multi-wavelength Study of cm-lambda Gyroresonance Emission from Active Regions	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						Solar eclipses; Radio astronomy; Solar observatories	SLOWLY CHANGING COMPONENT; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; VLA OBSERVATIONS; DENSITY; MODEL; MAPS	Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) is a science education partnership among NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Lewis Center for Educational Research, offering unique opportunities for K-12 students and their teachers. The GAVRT program operates a 34 m radio telescope with a wide-band, low noise receiver, which is tunable in four independent dual-polarization bands from 3 to 14 GHz. The annular eclipse of the Sun on 2012 May 20 was observed by GAVRT as part of education outreach. In this paper we present the results of this eclipse data and discuss the multi-wavelength strip scan brightness distribution across three active regions. We derive the source brightness temperatures and angular sizes as a function of frequency and interpret the results in terms of the gyroresonance mechanism. We show examples of the increasing brightness and widening of source size (isogauss surface) with wavelength as evidence for gyroresonance emission layers of broader (diverging) isogauss surfaces of the magnetic field geometry in the corona above solar surface. We present an example how the derived frequency-brightness temperature relationship is translated to a magnetic field-brightness temperature relationship under the frame-work of gyroresonance emission. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of GAVRT bands as excellent probes to study the layers of the corona above the active regions (Sun spots), in particular the prevalence of the gyroresonance mechanism. Our results provide a frame-work for multiwavelength cm-lambda eclipse observations and illustrate how the GAVRT program and K-12 student/teacher participation can produce science data useful to the scientific community and science missions.

Contrary to conventional manufacturing techniques, such as injection molding and machining, the cost-effectiveness, quick time-to-market, and ability to manufacture complex geometries make 3D printing a desirable alternative. However, the layer-by-layer process of 3D printing gives rise to poor adhesion strength between the polymer layers, defects and voids, as well as mechanical anisotropy. To investigate the latter, the study herein examines the stress-strain responses of different print orientations for 3D printed ABS samples subjected to tensile, compressive, and flexural loading. The physical properties of samples with the same print conditions and additional post-processing chemical treatment are also considered to include a comprehensive characterization protocol. Despite the print orientation (horizontal, sidewise, and vertical), the elastic modulus and strength at tensile failure of the 3D printed ABS were found to be less than its cast counterpart, by 41% and 46%, respectively. The experimental compressive mechanical properties were predicted, within a 2% error, by using the ratio of the overall cross-sectional area of the horizontally and vertically printed samples. Furthermore, the flexural stiffness and failure were found to be dominated by the tensile loading seen in the section of the sample below the neutral axis. The resulting average moduli and strengths were compiled onto a property-map to delineate the property-process interrelationship of 3D printed ABS, including the effect of diluted epoxy treatment and the dependency of print orientation on its mechanical behavior. In general, the property-map defines the design envelope to gauge the mechanical integrity of 3D printed ABS in different modalities and directionalities.

These observations triggered the present study that aims to determine the conditions under which the high-pressure (HP) ice layer, likely present between the deep ocean and the silicate core, poses a barrier for the exchange of volatiles. We model heat and water transport through this convecting HP ice layer using a two-phase numerical model of solid ice-liquid water mixture. We observe that for a large range of heat fluxes from the silicate core and HP ice layer thicknesses, a few percent of liquid water forms at the interface with the silicates. Liquid water being less dense than the HP ice, it creates additional buoyancy, thus facilitating the transport of volatiles towards the ocean. Our results also show that convection is characterized by the presence of hot and the absence of cold plumes. We derive a scaling law that describes the dependence of a critical heat flux for the onset of melting at the silicates interface on the thickness of the HP ice layer and the ice viscosity. We also study the processes at the interface with the base of the ocean where a few tens of kilometers thick layer of temperate (partially molten) ice is present. We find a scaling law for its thickness that depends mainly on the ice viscosity and the density difference between the ice and water. Water from this partially molten, temperate layer flows into the ocean thus completing the connection with the silicate core. The water flux depends primarily on the amount of heat supplied from the silicates. Future evolution models that will use the scaling laws derived in this study will place bounds on the timing of these exchange processes. Using Cassini data and reasonable values of HP ice viscosity and silicate heat flux, we predict melting at the silicates/HP ice interface at present time. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reappraisal of purported ca. 3.7 Ga stromatolites from the Isua Supracrustal Belt (West Greenland) from detailed chemical and structural analysis	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Isua Supracrustal Belt; stromatolites; Archean; biosignature; deformation; abiotic	ABIOLOGICAL ORIGIN; ORGANIC-MATTER; ALGAL MATS; NORTH-POLE; RECORD; TERM; CARBONATES; EVOLUTION; COMPLEX; ROCKS	The biogenicity of proposed stromatolite structures from Eoarchean (ca. 3.71 Ga) rocks of the Isua Supracrustal Belt (ISB) in West Greenland is under debate. The structures in question are found within a suite of multiply deformed greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphic rocks. To assess their premise as primary sedimentary features - as opposed to products of strain localization in layered, variably ductile rocks - we report new field mapping at the appropriate scale and resolution from the original discovery Sites reported by Nutman et al. (2016). Our new map was used to guide micro- and macro-structural investigations and comprehensive geochemical sampling. Here, we report detailed field characterization and structural analysis to show that the structures are linear inverted ridges aligned with azimuths of local and regional fold axes and parallel to linear structures; they are not deformed conical stromatolites. Combined major element (e.g., Ca, Mg, Si) scanning mu XRF maps, and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns collected on fresh surfaces cut perpendicular and parallel to the ridges attest to the lack of any residual sedimentary laminae (e.g., compositional layering) within these structures' cores. Internal layering previously inferred for these features instead arises from variable weathering of outcrop surfaces that otherwise conceals granoblastic quartz +/- dolomite cored boudins that sit between semi-continuous competent layers of enveloping quartzite in a calc-silicate schist. The morphology of boudins reflects viscosity contrasts of the different ductile layers during deformation. Therefore, these features are not of sedimentary origin. Furthermore, discontinuous field relationships and absence of primary sedimentary structures that could serve as way-up indicators preclude confident assignment of these outcrops as being structurally overturned, as originally argued. Collectively, our results show that the Isua structures are the expected result of a tectonic fabric that preserves no fine-scale primary sedimentary structures and were probably never stromatolites.

Echo of ring current storms in the ionosphere	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Ring current; Dst; V sigma index; Ionosphere; Plasmasphere; Total electron content; Storm	TIME; TEC; DST; PARAMETERS; INTENSITY; GRADIENTS; DENSITY; WEATHER; MODEL; MAPS	The ionospheric weather V sigma index maps are generated from GIM-TEC produced at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) with the denser grids of 1 x 1 degrees in latitude and longitude, respectively. Using sliding-window statistical analysis, moving TEC median mu for 15 preceding days with estimated variance bounds is obtained for each grid pixel of GIM-TEC. The ionosphere variability index, V sigma, is Delta TEC deviation from the median normalized by the standard deviation sigma. V sigma index segmentation is introduced specifying TEC storm if an instant TEC is outside the bound of mu +/- 2 sigma. Comparisons of V sigma variability of 1 x 1 degrees GIM-TEC maps with normal GIM-TECs of 2.5. 5. in latitude and longitude demonstrates the greater TEC storm activity with denser grids maps. The superposed epoch analysis is performed for 77 intense storms (Dst <= -100 nT) and 246 moderate storms (-100 < Dst <= -50 nT) during 2000-2017, with zero time, t(0), at Dst storm peak. The probabilities of TEC storm occurrence both positive (V sigma p index) and negative (V sigma n) are evaluated for 24 h prior to t(0) and 48 h after t(0) for global scale and three specified latitude zones: North High (NH) magnetic latitudes lambda > 50 degrees, South High (SH). < 50., and Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) Band between.35. magnetic latitudes. The equinoctial positive V sigma p index shows the maxima on March and September, Dst intensity peaks on April and October, and the negative V sigma n peaks on May and November. The amplitude of V sigma p for the intense storms exceeds that for the moderate storm by 2 times and exceeds the amplitude of V sigma n by 1.5 times. Storm Enhanced Density (SED) is evident with the largest amplitude of V sigma p at EIA Band exceeding V sigma p for NH and SH zones by 3 times. The negative V sigma n occurrence observed for selected zones during the intense storms is decreased by 5 times for the moderate storms. The normalized cross-correlation function is used to define lag (time delay) between peak of V sigma p and V sigma n and t(0) of Dst peak. The majority of positive V sigma p indices (57.5%) are observed prior to Dst storm (lag varies from 1 to 6 h with Dst from 50 to 400 nT) so the TEC enhancement can serve as a precursor of Dst storm. The time delay for the negative V sigma n is inversely related with Dst storm intensity (lag varies from 11 to 8 h with Dst from -50 to -400 nT).

Data bandwidth is very limited between planetary rovers and ground-based data system. What's worse, even though NASA has accumulated over 34 million images from various missions, it requires significant effort and is hardly possible for any scientist to go through all of them. In order to improve the degree of automation and the efficiency of these processes, we propose a system leveraging machine learning for planetary rovers to actively look for scientifically interesting and valuable features according to text instructions from scientists and prioritize the images captured onboard with those features for downlink. Such an image prioritization mechanism can also be naturally applied to content-based image search through text description in any local planetary image data server, allowing scientists to search for images with desired features without going through them one by one. Besides theoretical and engineering details of our proposed approach, we also present both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the system along with some concrete examples.

Fluctuations in Jupiter's equatorial stratospheric oscillation	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article; Early Access							SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION; TIME-DEPENDENCE; WAVE ACTIVITY; TEMPERATURES; BELT; JET; DISTURBANCE; DISRUPTION; CONVECTION; DYNAMICS	The equatorial stratospheres of Earth, Jupiter and Saturn all exhibit a remarkable periodic oscillation of their temperatures and winds with height. Earth's quasi-biennial oscillation and Saturn's quasi-periodic equatorial oscillation have recently been observed to experience disruptions in their vertical structure as a consequence of atmospheric events occurring far from the equator. Here we reveal that Jupiter's quasi-quadrennial oscillation can also be perturbed by strong tropospheric activity at equatorial and off-equatorial latitudes. Observations of Jupiter's stratospheric temperatures between 1980 and 2011 show two significantly different periods for the quasi-quadrennial oscillation, with a 5.7-yr period between 1980 and 1990 and a 3.9-yr period between 1996 and 2006. Major disruptions to the predicted quasi-quadrennial oscillation pattern in 1992 and 2007 coincided with marked planetary-scale disturbances in the equatorial and low-latitude troposphere, suggesting that they are connected to vertically propagating waves generated by meteorological sources in the deeper troposphere (that is 500-4,000-mbar pressures). Disruptions in Jupiter's periodic oscillations are thus inherently different from those of Saturn or the Earth. This interconnectivity between the troposphere and stratosphere, which is probably common to all planetary atmospheres, shows that seemingly regular cycles of variability can switch between different modes when subjected to extreme meteorological events. Multi-decade observations of Jupiter's stratospheric temperatures show that their quasiperiodic oscillation locked into a new period after a major atmospheric perturbation in 1992, from 5.7 years to 3.9 years. This is different from Earth (and presumably from Saturn), where the period returned to its original value after substantial atmospheric disruptions.

This paper presents MISTRAL (MultIdisciplinary deSign Tool for Robotic sAmpLing), a novel tool conceived for trade space exploration during early conceptual and preliminary design phases, where a rapid and broad evaluation is required for a very high number of configurations and boundary conditions. The tool rapidly determines the preliminary design envelope of a sampling apparatus to guarantee the stability condition of the whole robotic system. The tool implements a three-dimensional analytical model capable to reproduce several scenarios, being able to accept various input parameters, including the physical and geometrical characteristics of the robotic system, the properties related to the environment and the characteristics related to the sampling system. This feature can be exploited to infer multidisciplinary high-level requirements concerning several other elements of the investigated system, such as robotic arms and footpads. The presented research focuses on the application of MISTRAL to landers. The structure of the tool and the analysis model are presented. Results from the application of the tool to real mission data from NASA's Phoenix Mars lander are included. Moreover, the tool was adopted for the definition of the high-level requirements of the lander for a potential future mission to the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus, currently under investigation at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This case study was included to demonstrate the tool's capabilities. MISTRAL represents a comprehensive, versatile, and powerful tool providing guidelines for cognizant decisions in the early and most crucial stages of the design of robotic systems involved in sampling operations on planetary bodies.

Improved Constraints on Northern Extratropical CO2 Fluxes Obtained by Combining Surface-Based and Space-Based Atmospheric CO2 Measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						carbon cycle; CO2 flux; data assimilation; GOSAT; TCCON; OCO-2	ORBITING CARBON OBSERVATORY-2; POLE OBSERVATIONS HIPPO; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; IN-SITU; PARAMETERIZATION SIB2; GOSAT; DIOXIDE; IMPACT; MODEL	Top-down estimates of CO2 fluxes are typically constrained by either surface-based or space-based CO2 observations. Both of these measurement types have spatial and temporal gaps in observational coverage that can lead to differences in inferred fluxes. Assimilating both surface-based and space-based measurements concurrently in a flux inversion framework improves observational coverage and reduces sampling related artifacts. This study examines the consistency of flux constraints provided by these different observations and the potential to combine them by performing a series of 6-year (2010-2015) CO2 flux inversions. Flux inversions are performed assimilating surface-based measurements from the in situ and flask network, measurements from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), and space-based measurements from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), or all three data sets combined. Combining the data sets results in more precise flux estimates for subcontinental regions relative to any of the data sets alone. Combining the data sets also improves the accuracy of the posterior fluxes, based on reduced root-mean-square differences between posterior flux-simulated CO2 and aircraft-based CO2 over midlatitude regions (0.33-0.56 ppm) in comparison to GOSAT (0.37-0.61 ppm), TCCON (0.50-0.68 ppm), or in situ and flask measurements (0.46-0.56 ppm) alone. These results suggest that surface-based and GOSAT measurements give complementary constraints on CO2 fluxes in the northern extratropics and can be combined in flux inversions to improve constraints on regional fluxes. This stands in contrast with many earlier attempts to combine these data sets and suggests that improvements in the NASA Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval algorithm have significantly improved the consistency of space-based and surface-based flux constraints.

Assessment of Observational Evidence for Direct Convective Hydration of the Lower Stratosphere	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						stratosphere; water vapor; convection	WATER-VAPOR MEASUREMENTS; TROPOPAUSE; TRANSPORT; UNCERTAINTIES; DEHYDRATION; HYGROMETER; PLUMES	In situ and remote sensing observations of water vapor are analyzed to assess the evidence for direct convective hydration of the lower stratosphere. We have examined several hundred balloon-borne and airborne in situ measurements of lower stratospheric humidity in the tropics and northern midlatitudes. We find that the tropical lower stratospheric H2O enhancements above the background occur quite infrequently, and the height of the enhancements is within about 1 km of the cold-point tropopause. Following Schwartz et al. (2013, https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50421), we examine the anomalously high (above 8 ppmv) water vapor mixing ratios retrieved by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) at 100- and 82-hPa pressure levels, and we determine their vertical location relative to the local tropopause based on both Global Forecast System (GFS) operational analysis and the ERA5 reanalysis temperature data. We find that essentially all of the >8-ppmv MLS water vapor measurements over the extratropical North American monsoon region are above the relatively low lapse-rate tropopause in the region, and most are above the local cold-point tropopause. Over the Asian monsoon region, most (80/90%) of the high H2O values occur below the relatively high-altitude local lapse-rate/cold-point tropopause. Anomalously high MLS water vapor retrievals at 100 and 82 hPa almost never occur in the deep tropics. We show that this result is consistent with the in situ observations given the broad vertical averaging kernel of the MLS measurement. The available evidence suggests that direct hydration of the lower stratosphere is important over North America during the monsoon season but likely has limited impact in the tropics.	[Jensen, E.

The latter is divided into two subsets with (SON6) and without FIREs (NOS6) in CMIP6. Improvement in nonfalling cloud ice (similar to 20 g m(-2)) is noticeable over convective regions in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5. The inclusion of FIREs in SON6 subset may contribute to reduce biases of overestimated outgoing longwave radiation and downward surface shortwave and underestimated reflected shortwave at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by magnitudes of similar to 8 W m(-2) over convective regions against CERES, compared to NOS6 subset. The reduced biases in radiative fluxes in convective regions stabilize the atmosphere and lead to circulation, SST, cloud, and precipitation changes over the trade wind regions, as seen from improved radiative fluxes (similar to 15 W m(-2)), surface wind stress biases, SST (similar to 0.8 K), and precipitation (1 mm day(-1)) biases. The significant improvement from NOS6 to SON6 leads to improved multimodel means for CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 for radiation fields over the trade wind regions but the degradation over convective zones is attributed to NOS6 subset. The results suggest that other sources of uncertainty and deficiencies in climate models may play significant roles for reducing discrepancies although FIREs, via radiation-circulation coupling, may be one of the factors that help to reduce regional biases.

Strength Evolution of Ice Plume Deposit Analogs of Enceladus and Europa	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						sintering; strength; ice; Europa; Enceladus	INTERNAL STRUCTURE; CONE PENETRATION; WATER; SURFACE; HYDROGEN; SALTS; OCEAN	Enceladus and possibly Europa spew materials from their internal ocean into their exosphere, some of which are deposited back onto the surface of those Ocean Worlds. This setting provides a unique opportunity to seek traces of past or extant life in ice plume deposits on their surfaces. However, the design of lander missions and surface sampling techniques and the choice of sampling locations rely heavily on strength expectations. Here we present an experimental investigation of the evolution in strength of ice plume deposit analogs at several temperatures, as well as a model that predicts first-order estimates of the strength of evolved ice plume deposits under geologic timescales relevant to Enceladus and Europa. These results suggest that plume deposits remain weak and poorly consolidated on Enceladus, while they may develop substantial strength (comparable to solid ice) within <100 Myr on Europa. Plain Language Summary Enceladus and Europa are Ocean Worlds; they harbor an internal ocean beneath their ice shells. There is proof that a plume emits ocean materials out of Enceladus, similar to geysers on Earth, and some evidence for similar activity on Europa. Based on the composition of the plumes and the surface, both Enceladus and Europa are the leading outer solar system candidates for possibly harboring life. Areas where fresh plume materials are deposited would be the best location to search for traces of life on the surface. A major challenge in preparing mission concepts to explore these locations arises from the need to collect samples of the surface ice, while little is known at present about the mechanical properties of the surface. In this study, we prepared icy plume deposit analogs and let them evolve in the laboratory over extended periods of time to investigate the evolution of their strength. We find that plume deposits are likely to remain loose and exhibit a low strength over geologic timescales under Enceladus's conditions, suggesting that they would be relatively easy to sample. Conversely, under Europa's surface conditions, such plume deposits appear likely to develop a substantial strength.	[Choukroun, M.; Molaro, J. L.; Hodyss, R.; Marteau, E.; Backes, P.; Carey, E.

High-Spatiotemporal Resolution Observations of Jupiter Lightning-Induced Radio Pulses Associated With Sferics and Thunderstorms	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Jupiter; lightning; Juno; Hubble Space Telescope; Waves; MWR	MOIST CONVECTION; GALILEO IMAGES; FREQUENCY; RADIATION; VOYAGER-1; WHISTLER; SIGNALS; CLOUDS; WATER	Jupiter lightning discharges produce various kinds of phenomena including radio wave pulses at different frequencies. On 6 April 2019, the Juno Waves instrument captured an extraordinary series of radio pulses at frequencies below 150kHz on timescales of submilliseconds. Quasi-simultaneous multi-instrument data show that the locations of their magnetic footprints are very close to the locations of ultrahigh frequency (UHF) sferics recorded by the Juno MWR instrument. Hubble Space Telescope images show that the signature of active convection includes cloud-free clearings, in addition to the convective towers and deep water clouds that were also recognized in previous spacecraft observations of lightning source regions. Furthermore, the detections of 17 very low frequency/low-frequency (VLF/LF) radio pulses suggest a minimum duration of lightning processes on the order of submilliseconds. These observations provide new constraints on the physical properties of Jupiter lightning. Plain Language Summary Jupiter lightning illuminates clouds and produces a strong pulse at radio wavelengths. Juno's radio observatory (consisting of two onboard instruments) in a broad radio range made several detections of extraordinary radio pulses on 6 April 2019. The high-temporal observations of such radio pulses detected below 150kHz indicate variations of the lightning related processes on the order of submilliseconds. Observations of these radio pulses and direct lightning-induced radio emissions at 600MHz come from the same area, very close to deep water clouds detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the Jovian atmosphere. The coordinated Juno-HST lightning observations provide a new way of understanding the lightning processes and lightning source regions associated with the cloud features at Jupiter.

Here we present the first global retrievals of SIF at red wavelengths from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Despite the weak signal level, considerable uncertainties, and subtle measurement artifacts, spatial patterns and magnitudes agree with independent data sets. Over land, spatial patterns of our red SIF estimates covary with the far-red SIF data. Red SIF over the ocean is highly consistent with the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) inferred from measurements of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), even when comparing single days and fine spatial scales. Major advantages of our Fraunhofer line-based SIF retrievals include the capability to sense SIF through optically thin cloud/aerosol layers and an insensitivity to ocean color. This opens up new avenues for studying ocean biogeochemistry from space. Plain Language Summary Plants absorb sunlight to power photosynthesis, but a small fraction of the energy is always re-emitted as a faint glow termed solar-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence (SIF). This weak electromagnetic signal can be measured with spectrometers that are sensitive enough and cover the wavelengths where SIF occurs (red to far red). Even though SIF is not a direct measure of the carbon uptake by photosynthesis, strong linear relationships between far-red SIF and independent estimates of photosynthesis have been observed over land. ESA's Sentinel 5 Precursor satellite hosts the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a highly sensitive sensor designed to monitor atmospheric trace gases and air pollutants from space. The band setting of TROPOMI permits us also to infer SIF in both the red and far-red wavelength domain.

One rocket released a vapor trail observed from an airplane which showed peak velocities of >160 m/s near 108 km and turbulence coincident with strong unstable shear. Electric and magnetic fields and plasma density were measured on a second rocket. The current density peaked near 110 km exhibiting a spiral pattern with altitude that mirrored that of the winds, suggesting the dynamo is driven by tidal forcing. Such stratified currents are obscured in integrated ground measurements. Large electric fields produced a current opposite to that driven by the wind, believed created to minimize the current divergence. Using the observations, we solve the dynamo equation versus altitude, providing a new perspective on the complex nature of the atmospheric dynamo. Plain Language Summary Two rockets with scientific instruments were launched in the middle of the day to study the upper atmosphere and how it interacts with the ionosphere. The rockets ascended to altitudes of about 140 km-just high enough to gather the necessary data-before coming back down along parabolic trajectories. A vapor trail released by one rocket was photographed on an airplane and showed the upper atmosphere moving at very large speeds, much larger than previously believed. In fact, these winds were so large and changed speed so quickly that in some places the upper atmosphere became turbulent. Instruments on the second rocket gathered information about the ionosphere, including the number of ions present and how the currents and electric fields associated with those charged particles varied with altitude, particularly where the winds were strongest. The winds and currents both displayed a spiral pattern with altitude indicative that they were driven by atmospheric forcing from below. By combining all of these measurements, we are able to better determine what drives the worldwide system of currents at the base of the ionosphere. This "daytime dynamo" is a fundamental part of our natural world, swirling high above us and changing every day.

Collapse occurred in 62 discrete events, with "inflationary" deformation external to the collapse, similar to previous basaltic collapses. We take advantage of GPS data from the collapsing block and independent constraints on the magma chamber geometry from inversion of deflation prior to collapse onset. This provides an unparalleled opportunity to constrain the collapse geometry. Employing an axisymmetric finite element model, the co-collapse displacements are best explained by piston-like subsidence along a high angle (similar to 85 degrees) normal ring fault that may steepen to vertical with depth. Reservoir magma has compressibility of 2 -> 15x10(-10)Pa(-1), indicating bubble volume fractions from 1% to 7% (lower if fault steepens with depth). Magma pressure increases during collapses are 1 to 3MPa, depending on compressibility. Depressurization of a triaxial point source in a homogeneous half-space fits the data well but provides a biased representation of the source depth and process. Plain Language Summary When large volumes of magma erupt rapidly, the rock overlying the subsurface reservoir founders, producing a caldera. During the 2018 eruption of Klauea Volcano, Hawai'i, collapse occurred in over 60 events, each lasting 5 to 10s. We analyze GPS data collected during the last 32 of these events to determine the geometry of the ring fault system bounding the caldera block and the properties of the underlying magma. The faults are on average very steep but dip slightly inward at shallow depth. Inferred pressure increases during collapse events constrain the compressibility of the magma and imply an exsolved gas phase with 1% to 7 % bubbles by volume.

No comparable activity is observed at the north pole, which is heavily cratered with limited tectonism. Given the many lines of evidence supporting a global ocean under Enceladus' icy shell, the reason for the dichotomy in geologic activity is unclear. We model the formation of the Tiger Stripes as tidally-driven fractures and examine the magnitudes of tidal stresses with different ice shell structures in order to explore whether and how tidal stress might explain Enceladus' distribution of tectonic activity. We find that eccentricity-driven tidal stresses would produce fractures of nearly identical orientations to the observed Tiger Stripe Fractures and that a 10-km difference in ice shell thickness between the north and south poles can result in substantially different tidal stress magnitudes, providing a natural explanation for the hemispheric dichotomy in tectonic activity on Enceladus. Finally, we synthesize these results with Enceladus' global geologic record to offer insight into the evolution of this enigmatic moon. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The conversion methodology is presented, followed by an evaluation of the conversion algorithm's robustness. The SAGE-based backscatter products were compared to backscatter coefficients derived from ground-based lidar at three sites (Table Mountain Facility, Mauna Loa, and Observatoire de Haute-Provence). Further, the SAGE-derived lidar ratios were compared to values from previous balloon and theoretical studies. This evaluation includes the major eruption of Mt.

While the rovers have made major discoveries and dramatically increased our understanding of Mars, they require a great deal of interaction from the operations teams, and achieving mission objectives can take longer than anticipated when productivity is paced by the ground teams' ability to react. We have conducted a project to explore technologies and techniques for creating self-reliant rovers (SRR): rovers that are able to maintain high levels of productivity with reduced reliance on ground interactions. This paper describes the design of SRR and a prototype implementation that we deployed on a research rover. We evaluated the system by conducting a simulated campaign in which members of the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover) science team used our rover to explore a geographical region. The evaluation demonstrated the system's ability to maintain high levels of productivity with limited communication with operators.

Impact heat driven volatile redistribution at Occator crater on Ceres as a comparative planetary process	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; MARS; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; DEPOSITS; HISTORY; ORIGIN; MELT	Hydrothermal processes in impact environments on water-rich bodies such as Mars and Earth are relevant to the origins of life. Dawn mapping of dwarf planet (1) Ceres has identified similar deposits within Occator crater. Here we show using Dawn high-resolution stereo imaging and topography that Ceres' unique composition has resulted in widespread mantling by solidified water- and salt-rich mud-like impact melts with scattered endogenic pits, troughs, and bright mounds indicative of outgassing of volatiles and periglacial-style activity during solidification. These features are distinct from and less extensive than on Mars, indicating that Occator melts may be less gas-rich or volatiles partially inhibited from reaching the surface. Bright salts at Vinalia Faculae form thin surficial precipitates sourced from hydrothermal brine effusion at many individual sites, coalescing in several larger centers, but their ages are statistically indistinguishable from floor materials, allowing for but not requiring migration of brines from deep crustal source(s). Dawn mission's second extended phase provided high resolution observations of Occator crater of the dwarf planet Ceres. Here, the authors show stereo imaging and topographic maps of this crater revealing the influence of crustal composition on impact related melt and hydrothermal processes, and compare features to those on Mars, Earth and the Moon.

The varied sources of faculae-forming brines in Ceres' Occator crater emplaced via hydrothermal brine effusion	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							DEPOSITS; SURFACE; VESTA; ICE	Before acquiring highest-resolution data of Ceres, questions remained about the emplacement mechanism and source of Occator crater's bright faculae. Here we report that brine effusion emplaced the faculae in a brine-limited, impact-induced hydrothermal system. Impact-derived fracturing enabled brines to reach the surface. The central faculae, Cerealia and Pasola Facula, postdate the central pit, and were primarily sourced from an impact-induced melt chamber, with some contribution from a deeper, pre-existing brine reservoir. Vinalia Faculae, in the crater floor, were sourced from the laterally extensive deep reservoir only. Vinalia Faculae are comparatively thinner and display greater ballistic emplacement than the central faculae because the deep reservoir brines took a longer path to the surface and contained more gas than the shallower impact-induced melt chamber brines. Impact-derived fractures providing conduits, and mixing of impact-induced melt with deeper endogenic brines, could also allow oceanic material to reach the surfaces of other large icy bodies. The second extended phase of the Dawn mission provided high resolution observations of Occator crater of the dwarf planet Ceres. Here, the authors show that the central faculae were sourced in an impact-induced melt chamber, with a contribution from the deep brine reservoir, while the Vinalia Faculae were sourced by the deep brine reservoir alone.

Post-impact cryo-hydrologic formation of small mounds and hills in Ceres's Occator crater	NATURE GEOSCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access							WATER ICE; TUKTOYAKTUK PENINSULA; DOME CRATERS; GROWTH; PINGOS	Mounds within Ceres's Occator crater may have formed by freezing of water-rich impact-induced melt, by a process analogous to that of pingo formation on Earth, according to an analysis of data from NASA's Dawn mission. The intimate mixture of ice and silicate within the uppermost few kilometres of Ceres influences its geology and the evolution of its subsurface. Both ground ice and cryovolcanic processes have been hypothesized to form geologic terrains on Ceres, including within Occator crater, where they have been suggested to influence the post-impact surface evolution. Both types of processes involve the presence and expression of volatiles and brines, such that distinguishing between them could be difficult. Here, we use images and topography data from the NASA Dawn mission to investigate the morphology, age and distribution of mounds and hills within Occator crater, and infer their origin. The shapes and relative ages of many of these features suggest that they formed as impact-induced water-rich flows that covered the crater floor refroze in a manner similar to the formation of periglacial ice-cored mounds on Earth called pingos. We suggest that impacts on Ceres produced hydrologic conditions for surface changes in the absence of cryovolcanic processes. Our findings imply that cryo-hydrologic processes extend beyond Earth and Mars, and have been active on Ceres in the geologically recent past.	[Schmidt, B. E.; Hughson, K. H. G.; Duarte, K.

Long Wavelength InAs/InAsSb Infrared Superlattice Challenges: A Theoretical Investigation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						Infrared detector; unipolar barrier; type-II superlattice; InAs; InAsSbsuperlattice		InAs/InAsSb type-II superlattice focal plane arrays that demonstrate high operability and uniformity with cutoffs ranging from 5 mu m to 13 mu m have already been demonstrated. Compared to InAs/GaSb, the InAs/InAsSb superlattice is easier to grow and has longer minority carrier lifetimes, but requires a longer superlattice period to achieve long or very long wavelength cutoffs. A longer type-II superlattice period leads to smaller absorption coefficients and larger growth-direction hole conductivity effective masses. We explore by theoretical modeling some of the ideas aimed at addressing these challenges for the long and very long wavelength InAs/InAsSb superlattice. Increasing the Sb fraction in the InAsSb alloy can reduce the InAs/InAsSb superlattice period significantly, but this benefit can be negated by Sb segregation. Thin AlAsSb barrier layers can be inserted in InAs/InAsSb to form polytype W, M, and N superlattices in order to increase electron-hole wavefunction overlap for stronger optical absorption. However, this strategy can be unfavorable since the AlAsSb barriers increase the band gap, and thereby increase the superlattice period required to reach a given cutoff wavelength. Metamorphic growth on virtual substrates with larger lattice constants than GaSb can decrease the superlattice period needed to reach a specified cutoff wavelength, but this benefit should be weighed against the need for metamorphic buffer growth and the resulting higher defect density.

Trajectories with two lunar gravity assists are considered and analyzed. Two approaches are applied and tested for the design of missions aimed at Near-Earth asteroids. In the first method, indirect optimization of the heliocentric leg is combined to an approximate analytical treatment of the geocentric phase for short escape trajectories. In the second method, the results of pre-computed maps of escape C3 are employed for the design of longer Sun-perturbed escape sequences combined with direct optimization of the heliocentric leg. Features are compared and suggestions about a combined use of the approaches are presented. The techniques are efficiently applied to the design of a mission to a near-Earth asteroid.

Small lightning flashes from shallow electrical storms on Jupiter	NATURE			English	Article							MOIST CONVECTION; GALILEO IMAGES; ATMOSPHERE; PERFORMANCE; CLOUDS	Small lightning flashes detected on Jupiter by Juno have shallow origins above the 2-bar level of Jupiter's atmosphere where temperatures are too low for liquid water to exist. Lightning flashes have been observed by a number of missions that visited or flew by Jupiter over the past several decades. Imagery led to a flash rate estimate of about 4 x 10(-3)flashes per square kilometre per year (refs.(1,2)). The spatial extent of Voyager flashes was estimated to be about 30 kilometres (half-width at half-maximum intensity, HWHM), but the camera was unlikely to have detected the dim outer edges of the flashes, given its weak response to the brightest spectral line of Jovian lightning emission, the 656.3-nanometre H alpha line of atomic hydrogen(1,3-6). The spatial resolution of some cameras allowed investigators to confirm 22 flashes with HWHM greater than 42 kilometres, and to estimate one with an HWHM of 37 to 45 kilometres (refs.(1,7-9)). These flashes, with optical energies comparable to terrestrial 'superbolts'-of (0.02-1.6) x 10(10) joules-have been interpreted as tracers of moist convection originating near the 5-bar level of Jupiter's atmosphere (assuming photon scattering from points beneath the clouds)(1-3,7,8,10-12). Previous observations of lightning have been limited by camera sensitivity, distance from Jupiter and long exposures (about 680 milliseconds to 85 seconds), meaning that some measurements were probably superimposed flashes reported as one(1,2,7,9,10,13). Here we report optical observations of lightning flashes by the Juno spacecraft with energies of approximately 10(5)-10(8) joules, flash durations as short as 5.4 milliseconds and inter-flash separations of tens of milliseconds, with typical terrestrial energies. The flash rate is about 6.1 x 10(-2)flashes per square kilometre per year, more than an order of magnitude greater than hitherto seen. Several flashes are of such small spatial extent that they must originate above the 2-bar level, where there is no liquid water(14,15). This implies that multiple mechanisms for generating lightning on Jupiter need to be considered for a full understanding of the planet's atmospheric convection and composition.

In this work, a double negative differential resistance (D-NDR) characteristic of a hybrid 2D vdW/organic tunneling device consisting of a hafnium disulfide/pentacene heterojunction and a 3D pentacene resistor is reported. This D-NDR phenomenon is achieved by precisely controlling an NDR peak voltage with the pentacene resistor and then integrating two distinct NDR devices in parallel. Then, the operation of a controllable-gain amplifier configured with the D-NDR device and an n-channel transistor is demonstrated using the Cadence Spectre simulation platform. The proposed D-NDR device technology based on a hybrid 2D vdW/organic heterostructure provides a scientific foundation for various circuit applications that require the NDR phenomenon.

Assessment of Regional Methane Emission Inventories through Airborne Quantification in the San Francisco Bay Area	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LOS-ANGELES; GOSAT; OIL	This study derives methane emission rates from 92 airborne observations collected over 23 facilities including 5 refineries, 10 landfills, 4 wastewater treatment plants (POTWs), 2 composting operations, and 2 dairies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Emission rates are measured using an airborne mass-balance technique from a low-flying aircraft. Annual measurement-based sectorwide methane emissions are 19,000 +/- 2300 Mg for refineries, 136,700 +/- 25,900 Mg for landfills, 11,900 +/- 1,500 Mg for POTWs, and 11,100 +/- 3,400 Mg for composting. The average of measured emissions for each refinery ranges from 4 to 23 times larger than the corresponding emissions reported to regulatory agencies, while measurement-derived landfill and POTW estimates are approximately twice the current inventory estimates. Significant methane emissions at composting facilities indicate that a California mandate to divert organics from landfills to composting may not be an effective measure for mitigating methane emissions unless best management practices are instituted at composting facilities. Complementary evidence from airborne remote sensing imagery indicates atmospheric venting from refinery hydrogen plants, landfill working surfaces, composting stockpiles, etc., to be among the specific source types responsible for the observed discrepancies. This work highlights the value of multiple measurement approaches to accurately estimate facility-scale methane emissions and perform source attribution at subfacility scales to guide and verify effective mitigation policy and action.

The BISTRO data cover the entire NGC 1333 complex (similar to 1.5 pc x 2 pc) at 0.02 pc resolution and spatially resolve the polarized emission from individual filamentary structures for the first time. The inferred magnetic field structure is complex as a whole, with each individual filament aligned at different position angles relative to the local field orientation. We combine the BISTRO data with low- and high- resolution data derived from Planck and interferometers to study the multiscale magnetic field structure in this region. The magnetic field morphology drastically changes below a scale of similar to 1 pc and remains continuous from the scales of filaments (similar to 0.1 pc) to that of protostellar envelopes (similar to 0.005 pc or similar to 1000 au). Finally, we construct simple models in which we assume that the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the long axis of the filaments. We demonstrate that the observed variation of the relative orientation between the filament axes and the magnetic field angles are well reproduced by this model, taking into account the projection effects of the magnetic field and filaments relative to the plane of the sky. These projection effects may explain the apparent complexity of the magnetic field structure observed at the resolution of BISTRO data toward the filament network.

We apply two methods: the Max Spectrum method can detect the predominant clusters, and the declustering threshold time method provides details on the typical clustering properties and timescales. Our analysis shows that during the different phases of solar cycles 23 and 24, CMEs with speeds >= 1000 km s(-1)preferentially occur as isolated events and in clusters with, on average, two members. However, clusters with more members appear, particularly during the maximum phases of the solar cycles. Over the total period and in the maximum phases of solar cycles 23 and 24, about 50% are isolated events, 18% (12%) occur in clusters with two (three) members, and another 20% in larger clusters >= 4, whereas in a solar minimum, fast CMEs tend to occur more frequently as isolated events (62%). During different solar cycle phases, the typical declustering timescales of fast CMEs are tau(c) = 28-32 hr, irrespective of the very different occurrence frequencies of CMEs during a solar minimum and maximum. These findings suggest that tau(c)for extreme events may reflect the characteristic energy build-up time for large flare and CME-prolific active regions. Statistically associating the clustering properties of fast CMEs with the disturbance storm time index at Earth suggests that fast CMEs occurring in clusters tend to produce larger geomagnetic storms than isolated fast CMEs. This may be related to CME-CME interaction producing a more complex and stronger interaction with Earth's magnetosphere.	[Gomez, Jenny M.

This QSO is the first spectroscopically confirmed candidate from an ongoing search using the combination of Gaia and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry to identify bright QSOs at z > 2, the redshift regime for which the Ly alpha forest is accessible with ground-based facilities. With a Gaia apparent magnitude G = 16.07, 2MASS J13260399 + 7023462 is one of the brightest QSOs known at z > 2, with only 15 currently known brighter QSOs. Given its inferred M-1450,M-AB magnitude and redshift, it is among the most luminous objects in the universe; the inferred black hole mass and corresponding Eddington ratio are (2.7 +/- 0.4) x 10(10) M-circle dot and 1.3 +/- 0.3, respectively. Follow-up Hubble observations confirm it is not gravitationally lensed.

TOI-1728b: The Habitable-zone Planet Finder Confirms a Warm Super-Neptune Orbiting an M-dwarf Host	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet detection methods; Radial velocity; Planet hosting stars	TRANSMISSION SPECTRA; MASS; EXOPLANETS; PERTURBATIONS; LUMINOSITY; EVOLUTION; EFFICIENT; BINARIES; VELOCITY; CATALOG	We confirm the planetary nature of TOI-1728b using a combination of ground-based photometry, near-infrared Doppler velocimetry and spectroscopy with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. TOI-1728 is an old, inactive M0 star with Teff = 3980(-32)(+31) K, which hosts a transiting super-Neptune at an orbital period of similar to 3.49 days. Joint fitting of the radial velocities and TESS and ground-based transits yields a planetary radius of 5.05(-0.17)(+0.16) R-circle plus, mass 26.78(-5.13)(+5.43) M-circle plus, and eccentricity 0.057(-0.039)(+0.054). We estimate the stellar properties, and perform a search for He 10830 angstrom absorption during the transit of this planet and claim a null detection with an upper limit of 1.1% with 90% confidence. A deeper level of He 10830 angstrom absorption has been detected in the planet atmosphere of GJ 3470b, a comparable gaseous planet. TOI-1728b is the largest super-Neptune-the intermediate subclass of planets between Neptune and the more massive gas-giant planets-discovered around an M dwarf. With its relatively large mass and radius, TOI-1728 represents a valuable data point in the M-dwarf exoplanet mass-radius diagram, bridging the gap between the lighter Neptune-sized planets and the heavier Jovian planets known to orbit M dwarfs. With a low bulk density of 1.14(-0.24)(+0.26) g cm(-3), and orbiting a bright host star (J similar to 9.6, V similar to 12.4), TOI-1728b is also a promising candidate for transmission spectroscopy both from the ground and from space, which can be used to constrain planet formation and evolutionary models.

Their propagation through the Sun's heliosphere and their interaction with planetary bodies have been widely studied in the solar system (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus, and Europa). There is currently much interest in exoplanetary science, particularly in terms of characterizing the potential habitability of exoplanetary environments. As a consequence of this, models have been developed to quantify the effect of GCRs on exoplanet systems. However, many such studies assume Earth-like (1 au) GCR fluxes. Here we will demonstrate why this is not a reasonable assumption. We briefly discuss the journey that GCRs make from their birth to the arrival at an exoplanet, and discuss the various implications this will have on GCR fluxes. We demonstrate the importance of understanding the specific local interstellar medium (ISM) that an exoplanetary system resides within, as this determines the size of the astrosphere of the host star. This has strong implications for the modulation of GCR fluxes throughout an astrosphere. We estimate how GCR proton fluxes at 1 au (from the Sun) would be different from current values if the solar system was embedded in a different ISM environment. Furthermore, we provide estimates of the wide range of possible GCR proton fluxes at the exoplanets Kepler-20f and Kepler-88c using previously published estimates for the local ISM parameters at these bodies.

Cold molecular gas and free-free emission from hot, dust-obscured galaxies at z similar to 3	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; radio lines: galaxies	SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; RADIO PROPERTIES; HIGH-REDSHIFT; PHYSICS; QUASARS; MERGERS	We report on observations of redshifted CO(1-0) line emission and observed-frame similar to 30 GHz radio continuum emission from five ultra-luminous, mid-IR selected hot, Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at z greater than or similar to 3 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We detect CO(1-0) line emission in all five Hot DOGs, with one of them at high signal-to-noise ratio. We analyse FIR-radio spectral energy distributions, including dust, free-free, and synchrotron emission for the galaxies. We find that most of the 115 GHz rest-frame continuum is mostly due to synchrotron or free-free emission, with only a potentially small contribution from thermal emission. We see a deficit in the rest-frame 115 GHz continuum emission compared to dusty star-forming galaxies and sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) at high redshift, suggesting that Hot DOGs do not have similar cold gas reserves compared with star-forming galaxies. One target, W2305-0039, is detected in the FIRST 1.4 GHz survey, and is likely to possess compact radio jets. We compare to the FIR-radio correlation, and find that at least half of the Hot DOGs in our sample are radio-quiet with respect to normal galaxies. These findings suggest that Hot DOGs have comparably less cold molecular gas than star-forming galaxies at lower, z similar to 2 redshifts, and are dominated by powerful, yet radio-quiet AGN.

We specifically focus on Milky Way-mass disc galaxies at late times (z approximate to 0). In agreement with observations, we find a relatively flat relationship, with sigma approximate to N 15-30 km s(-1) in neutral gas across 3 dex in SFRs. We show that higher dense gas fractions (ratios of dense gas to neutral gas) and SFRs arc correlated at constant sigma. Similarly, lower gas fractions (ratios of gas to stellar mass) are correlated with higher sigma at constant SFR. The limits of the sigma-Sigma(SFR) relation correspond to the onset of strong outflows. We see evidence of 'on-off' cycles of star formation in the simulations, corresponding to feedback injection time-scales of 10-100 Myr, where SFRs oscillate about equilibrium SFR predictions. Finally, SFRs and velocity dispersions in the simulations agree well with feedback-regulated and marginally stable gas disc (Toomre's Q = 1) model predictions, and the simulation data effectively rule out models assuming that gas turns into stars at (low) constant efficiency (i.e. 1 per cent per free-fall time). And although the simulation data do not entirely exclude gas accretion/gravitationally powered turbulence as a driver of sigma, it appears to be subdominant to stellar feedback in the simulated galaxy discs at z approximate to 0.

Confirmation of water emission in the dayside spectrum of the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121b	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: spectroscopic; planets and satellites: atmospheres	NEPTUNE-MASS EXOPLANET; HOT; ATMOSPHERES	We present four new secondary eclipse observations for the ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121b acquired using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The eclipse depth is measured to a median precision of 60 ppm across 28 spectroscopic channels spanning the 1.12-1.64 mu m wavelength range. This is a considerable improvement to the 90 ppm precision we achieved previously for a single eclipse observation using the same observing set-up. Combining these data with those reported at other wavelengths, a blackbody spectrum for WASP-121b is ruled out at >6 sigma confidence and we confirm the interpretation of previous retrieval analyses that found the data are best explained by a dayside thermal inversion. The updated spectrum clearly resolves the water emission hand at 1.3-1.6 mu m, with higher signal-to-noise than before. It also fails to reproduce a bump in the spectrum at 1.25 mu m derived from the first eclipse observation, which had tentatively been attributed to VO emission. We conclude that the latter was either a statistical fluctuation or a systematic artefact specific to the first eclipse data set.

Testing the relativistic Doppler boost hypothesis for the binary candidate quasar PG1302-102 with multiband Swift data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						quasars: individual: PG1302-102; quasars: supermassive black holes	BLACK-HOLE BINARIES; VARIABILITY; ACCRETION; PERIODICITY; POPULATION; DISCS	The bright quasar PG1302-102 has been identified as a candidate supermassive black hole binary from its near-sinusoidal optical variability. While the significance of its optical periodicity has been debated due to the stochastic variability of quasars, its multiwavelength variability in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands is consistent with relativistic Doppler boost caused by the orbital motion in a binary. However, this conclusion was based previously on sparse UV data that were not taken simultaneously with the optical data. Here, we report simultaneous follow-up observations of PG1302-102 with the Ultraviolet Optical Telescope on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in six optical + UV bands. The additional nine Swift observations produce light curves roughly consistent with the trend under the Doppler boost hypothesis, which predicts that UV variability should track the optical, but with a similar to 2.2 times higher amplitude. We perform a statistical analysis to quantitatively test this hypothesis. We find that the data are consistent with the Doppler boost hypothesis when we compare the the amplitudes in optical B-band and UV light curves. However, the ratio of UV to V-band variability is larger than expected and is consistent with the Doppler model, only if either the UV/optical spectral slopes vary, the stochastic variability makes a large contribution in the UV, or the sparse new optical data underestimate the true optical variability. We have evidence for the latter from comparison with the optical light curve from All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. Additionally, the simultaneous analysis of all four bands strongly disfavours the Doppler boost model whenever Swift V band is involved. Additional, simultaneous optical + UV observations tracing out another cycle of the 5.2-yr proposed periodicity should lead to a definitive conclusion.

The most intense geomagnetic storm (SYM-H peak = -146 nT) starting on September 7 had a three-step main phase. A compound interplanetary structure resulting from an FS encountering and compressing the upstream MC southward interplanetary magnetic fields (IMFs) caused the first two steps of the storm. A magnetospheric supersubstorm (SSS; SML peak = -3712 nT) led to the third and most intense step. An MC portion of an ICME created an intense storm (SYM-H peak = -115 nT) on September 8. A second SSS (SML peak = -2642 nT) occurred during the main phase of this storm. Intense geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) occurred during the SSSs. Two moderate magnetic storms with peak SYM-H indices of -65 and -74 nT occurring on September 13 and 27 were caused by sheath and CIR southward IMFs, respectively. Six FSs and their associated sheaths caused sudden impulses (SI(+)s) of magnitude ranging from +11 to +56 nT. The shocks/sheaths led to magnetospheric relativistic electron flux decreases. The RWs caused SI(-)s and substorm recoveries by reducing southward IMFs. The high-intensity long-duration continuous AE activities (HILDCAAs) caused by the HSSs were related to the increase/acceleration of relativistic electron fluxes.

We detect [C II] emission from 80% of the total positions, with a 95% detection rate from the dense boundary region. The integrated intensity of the [C II] emission remains relatively constant across each boundary, despite the observed range in optical extinction between 1 and 10 mag. This flat profile indicates a constant heating and cooling rate within both regions observed. The integrated intensity of [C II] emission is reasonably well correlated with the neutral hydrogen (H I) column density, as well as the total gas column density. This, in addition to the 80' (7 pc) extent of the [C II] emission from the cloud center, suggests that the H I envelope plays a dominant role in explaining the [C II] emission emanating from Perseus. We compare the [C II] and (CO)-C-12 integrated intensities with predictions from a 1D, two-sided slab PDR model and show that a simple core + envelope, equilibrium model without an additional "CO-dark" H-2 component can reproduce observations well. Additional observations are needed to disentangle how much of the [C II] emission is associated with the "CO-dark" H-2 gas, as well as constrain spatial variations of the dust-to-gas ratio across Perseus.

FIREBall observes a component of galaxies that plays a key role in how galaxies form and evolve, likely contains a significant amount of baryons, and has only recently been observed at higher redshifts in the visible. Here we report on the 2018 flight of the FIREBall-2 Balloon telescope, which occurred on 2018 September 22 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The flight was the culmination of a complete redesign of the spectrograph from the original FIREBall fiber-fed integral field unit to a wide-field multiobject spectrograph. The flight was terminated early owing to a hole in the balloon, and our original science objectives were not achieved. The overall sensitivity of the instrument and telescope was 90,000 LU, due primarily to increased noise from stray light. We discuss the design of the FIREBall-2 spectrograph, including modifications from the original FIREBall payload, and provide an overview of the performance of all systems. We were able to successfully flight-test a new pointing control system, a UV-optimized, delta-doped, and coated electron multiplying CCD, and an aspheric grating. The FIREBall-2 team is rebuilding the payload for another flight attempt in the fall of 2021, delayed from 2020 as a result of COVID-19.

The combined data set used in this work includes data from the Low-Frequency Array Two-meter Sky Survey, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We find that there are five radio sources, which are all located within 500 kpc (similar to 1 ') of the cluster center and have radio luminositiesP(1.4 GHz) > 1.6 x 10(24)W Hz(-1). The typical host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass galaxies in the cluster. The exceptional radio activity among the massive galaxy population appears to be linked to the dynamical state of the cluster. The galaxy distribution suggests an ongoing merger, with a subgroup found to the northwest of the main cluster. Furthermore, two of the five sources are classified as bent-tail sources, with one being a potential wide-angle tail/hybrid morphology radio source, indicating a dynamic environment. The cluster also lies in a region of the mass-richness plane occupied by other merging clusters in the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. The data suggest that during the merger phase, radio activity can be dramatically enhanced, which would contribute to the observed trend of increased radio activity in clusters with increasing redshift.

Here, we present the detection and mass measurement of a small, short-period (4 days) transiting planet around the bright (V = 7.9), solar-type star HD 86226 (TOI-652, TIC 22221375), previously known to host a long-period (similar to 1600 days) giant planet. HD 86226c (TOI-652.01) has a radius of 2.16 0.08 R-circle plus and a mass of M-circle plus, based on archival and new radial velocity data. We also update the parameters of the longer-period, not-known-to-transit planet, and find it to be less eccentric and less massive than previously reported. The density of the transiting planet is 3.97 g cm(-3), which is low enough to suggest that the planet has at least a small volatile envelope, but the mass fractions of rock, iron, and water are not well-constrained. Given the host star brightness, planet period, and location of the planet near both the "radius gap" and the "hot Neptune desert," HD 86226c is an interesting candidate for transmission spectroscopy to further refine its composition.

Rotation of Two Micron All Sky Survey Clumps in Molecular Clouds	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Interstellar medium; Interstellar dynamics; Interstellar molecules; Intercloud medium; Interstellar emissions	DARK CLOUDS; DENSE CORES; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; STAR-FORMATION; FRAGMENTATION; EVOLUTION; COLLAPSE; CO; ABSORPTION; KINEMATICS	We have analyzed the rotational properties of 12 clumps using (CO)-C-13 (1-0) and (CO)-O-18 (1-0) maps of the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 13.7 m radio telescope. The clumps, located within molecular clouds, have radii (R) in the range of 0.06-0.27 pc. The direction of clump elongation is not correlated with the direction of the velocity gradient. We measured the specific angular momentum (J/M) to be between 0.0022-0.025 pc km s(-1)based on (CO)-C-13 images, and between 0.0025-0.021 pc km s(-1)based on (CO)-O-18 images. The consistency ofJ/Mbased on different tracers indicates the(13)CO and (CO)-O-18 in dense clumps trace essentially the same material despite significantly different opacities. We also found thatJ/Mincreases monotonically as a function ofRin power-law form,<J/M proportional to R-1.58 +/- 0.11. The ratio between rotation energy and gravitational energy,beta, ranges from 0.0012 to 0.018. The small values of beta imply that rotation alone is not sufficient to support the clump against gravitational collapse.

We present > 650 field-based, surface-displacement observations for these ruptures and synthesize our results into cumulative along-strike displacement distributions. Using these data, we calculate displacement gradients and compare our results with historical strike-slip ruptures in the eastern California shear zone. For the M-w 6.4 rupture, we report 96 displacements measured along 18 km of northeast-striking rupture. Cumulative displacement curves for the rupture yield a mean left-lateral displacement of 0.3-0.5 m and maximum of 0.7-1.6 m. Net mean vertical displacement based on the difference of down-to-the-west (DTW) and down-to-the-east (DTE) displacement curves is close to zero (0.02 m DTW). The M-w 6.4 displacement distribution shows that the majority of displacement occurred southwest of the intersection with the M-w 7.1 rupture. The M-w 7.1 rupture is northwest-striking and 50 km long based on 576 field measurements. Displacement curves indicate a mean right-lateral displacement of 1.2-1.7 m and a maximum of 4.3-7.0 m. Net vertical displacement in the rupture averages 0.3 m DTW. The M-w 7.1 displacement distributions demonstrate that maximum displacement occurred along a 12-km-long portion of the fault near the M-w 7.1 epicenter, releasing 66% of the geologically based seismic moment along 24% of the total rupture length. Using our displacement distributions, we calculate kilometer-scale displacement gradients for the M-w 7.1 rupture. The steepest gradients (similar to 1-3 m/km) flank the 12-km-long region of maximum displacement. In contrast, gradients for the 1992 M-w 7.3 Landers and 1999 M-w 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes are <0.6 m/km. Our displacement distributions are important for understanding the influence of cross-fault rupture on M-w 6.4 and 7.1 rupture length and displacement and will facilitate comparisons with distributions generated remotely and at broader scales.

We consider the extent to which a damage proxy map (DPM) generated from satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar images can detect minor damage throughout the town of Ridgecrest. The DPM does not, as expected, detect all minor structural damage to individual structures, nor can it distinguish between structural damage and earthquake-related movement that is not consequential. However, the DPM does confirm many instances of minor structural damage to larger structures and groups of smaller structures and in some instances suggests minor structural damage that is not apparent upon visual inspection. Although ambiguous identification of minor damage may not be useful to guide earthquake response, the identification of minor, possibly hidden damage is potentially useful for other purposes. Overall, the DPM confirms that structural damage was commensurate with modified Mercalli intensity no higher than 7 throughout Ridgecrest. We consider both instrumental and intensity data to explore further the distribution of near-field ground motions over the frequency range of engineering concern. Peak ground accelerations and peak ground velocities estimated from "Did You Feel It?" intensity data using the Worden et al. (2012) ground-motion intensity conversion equation (GMICE) are consistent with recorded instrumental data. Both instrumental and estimated mainshock peak accelerations are further consistent with predictions from both the Boore et al. (2014) ground-motion prediction equation (GMPE), but lower than predicted by the Atkinson and Wald (2007) and Atkinson et al. (2014) intensity prediction equations (IPEs). A GMPE such as Boore et al. which is constrained by a large global dataset, together with a well- constrained GMICE, may thus characterize expected shaking intensities for large earthquakes better than an IPE based on more limited intensity data.

Impact-driven mobilization of deep crustal brines on dwarf planet Ceres	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							EVOLUTION; GRAVITY; MODEL; CRATER; STATE; SHAPE; ICE	Ceres, the only dwarf planet in the inner Solar System, appears to be a relict ocean world. Data collected by NASA's Dawn spacecraft provided evidence that global aqueous alteration within Ceres resulted in a chemically evolved body that remains volatile-rich(1). Recent emplacement of bright deposits sourced from brines attests to Ceres being a persistently geologically active world(2,3), but the surprising longevity of this activity at the 92-km Occator crater has yet to be explained. Here, we use new high-resolution Dawn gravity data to study the subsurface architecture of the region surrounding Occator crater, which hosts extensive young bright carbonate deposits (faculae). Gravity data and thermal modelling imply an extensive deep brine reservoir beneath Occator, which we argue could have been mobilized by the heating and deep fracturing associated with the Occator impact, leading to long-lived extrusion of brines and formation of the faculae. Moreover, we find that pre-existing tectonic cracks may provide pathways for deep brines to migrate within the crust, extending the regions affected by impacts and creating compositional heterogeneity. The long-lived hydrological system resulting from the impact might also occur for large impacts in icy moons, with implications for creation of transient habitable niches over time. High-resolution data of Ceres's bright spots (faculae), obtained by Dawn's second extended mission, suggest the existence of a deep brine-rich reservoir that emerged to the surface through long-lived cryovolcanic activity as a consequence of the impact that created Occator crater.

Evidence of non-uniform crust of Ceres from Dawn's high-resolution gravity data	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							GEOMORPHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; GROUND ICE; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; INSIGHTS; MOON	High-resolution gravity data from Dawn's second extended mission could probe the global and local structure of Ceres's crust. The results show significant spatial and vertical variations of crustal density and porosity, associated with ice features and ice-related processes driven from the interior, and impacts. The gravity and shape data acquired by the Dawn spacecraft during its primary mission revealed that Ceres is partially differentiated with an interior structure consistent with a volatile-rich crust, a mantle of hydrated rock and isostatically compensated topography(1-3). Detailed analyses showed that the mechanically strong crust overlays a weak, fluid-bearing upper mantle(4). Previous studies, however, assumed that Ceres's crust is a uniform layer. Here, we report findings from the new high-resolution gravity data from Dawn's second extended mission (XM2), which reveal a complex crustal structure of Ceres. In the low-altitude regions probed by the Dawn spacecraft during the XM2 phase, we observe that gravity-topography admittance progressively shifts to a lower density solution at higher degrees, implying a radial density gradient across Ceres's crust that is consistent with decreasing porosity with depth and/or increasing content of dense phases, such as rock and salts. That gradient brings a critical new constraint on the crustal freezing history, suggesting that the salts and silicates concentrated in the liquid phase while the crust was growing. Localized spectral analysis of the new data also shows evidence for a lower crustal density in the north polar region than in the south or near the equator, supporting impact-driven porosity variations for the observed latitudinal density differences(5). On the local scale, the new data show evidence for density or rheological variations within the crust, in association with lobate landslides and ejecta deposits that were inferred to be ice-rich(6,7)as well as an extensional fault system(8). These inferences provide geophysical context for geological features on the surface and help us advance our understanding of the evolution of an ice-rich but heat-starved body, whose evolution was in part shaped by impacts.

Fresh emplacement of hydrated sodium chloride on Ceres from ascending salty fluids	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							WATER ICE; ORGANIC-MATTER; SURFACE; DEPOSITS; CRATER; PLUME	Spectroscopic data obtained at high spatial resolution from Dawn detected the presence of fresh chloride salts at Cerealia Facula on Ceres. The spatial distribution of the hydration level of these salts suggests that they surfaced a maximum of a few centuries ago and that the upwelling of salty fluids may still be active. The surface and internal structure of Ceres show evidence of a global process of aqueous alteration, indicating the existence of an ocean in the past. However, it is not clear whether part of this ocean is still present and whether residual fluids are still circulating in the dwarf planet. These fluids may be exposed in a geologically young surface, and the most promising site to verify the occurrence of present fluids on Ceres is Cerealia Facula dome, in Occator crater. This very young facula exhibits minerals that are relatively rare in our Solar System, the formation of which requires the presence of liquid water in combination with hydrothermal activity. Here we report the discovery of hydrated sodium chloride on Cerealia Facula. These newly identified chloride salts are concentrated on the top of the dome, close to a system of radial fractures. The spatial distribution of the hydrated phase suggests that chloride salts are the solid residue of deep brines that reached the surface only recently, or are still ascending. These salts are very efficient in maintaining Ceres's warm internal temperature and lowering the eutectic temperature of the brines, in which case ascending salty fluids may exist in Ceres today.

Recent cryovolcanic activity at Occator crater on Ceres	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							INTERNAL STRUCTURE; SURFACE; CHRONOLOGY; EVOLUTION; GANYMEDE; BRIGHT; VESTA; MARS	NASA's Dawn mission revealed a partially differentiated Ceres that has experienced cryovolcanic activity throughout its history up to the recent past. The Occator impact crater, which formed ~22 Myr ago, displays bright deposits (faculae) across its floor whose origins are still under debate: two competing hypotheses involve eruption of brines from the crust-mantle transition boundary (remnants of an ancient ocean) or alternatively from a shallow impact melt chamber. Here we report new constraints on the history of Occator that help in testing the hypotheses of its formation. We used high-resolution images of the Dawn Framing Camera obtained close to the end of the mission. We found a long-lasting and recent period of cryovolcanic activity, which started <= 9 Myr ago and lasted for several million years. Several resurfacing events, affecting the faculae and some (dark) solidified impact melt units, are shown to have occurred millions of years after crater formation and the dissipation of the impact-generated heat. These findings are indicative of a deep-seated brine source. Extensive volatile-driven emplacement of bright material occurred in the central floor, causing its subsidence due to mass loss at depth. Finally, a thick (extrusive) dome of bright material was raised in the central depression. The derived chronostratigraphy of Occator is consistent with a recently geologically active world, where salts play a major role in preserving liquid in a heat-starved body. High-spatial-resolution images of the bright points at Occator crater on Ceres, taken during the second extended Dawn mission, allowed reconstruction of the chronology of their formation. The area experienced extensive cryovolcanism less than nine million years ago that lasted several million years, indicating recent geological activity.

We present a simplified framework for developing a high spatial resolution map of urban vegetation cover in the Southern California Air Basin (SoCAB) with publicly available satellite imagery. This method uses Sentinel-2 (10-60 x 10-60 m) and National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) (0.6 x 0.6 m) optical imagery to classify urban and non-urban areas of impervious surface, tree, grass, shrub, bare soil/non-photosynthetic vegetation, and water. Our approach was designed for Los Angeles, a geographically complex megacity characterized by diverse Mediterranean land cover and a mix of high-rise buildings and topographic features that produce strong shadow effects. We show that a combined NAIP and Sentinel-2 classification reduces misclassified shadow pixels and resolves spatially heterogeneous vegetation gradients across urban and non-urban regions in SoCAB at 0.6-10 m resolution with 85% overall accuracy and 88% weighted overall accuracy. Results from this study will enable the long-term monitoring of land cover change associated with urbanization and quantification of biospheric contributions to carbon and water cycling in cities.

However, some of these configurations cannot be realized because the joint-torques required to sustain them would be above their limits (actuation limits). In this article, we rule out such configurations and define the feasible region, a revisited support region that guarantees both global static stability in the sense of tip-over and slippage avoidance and of existence of a set of joint-torques that are able to sustain the robot's body weight. We show that the feasible region can be employed for the online selection of feasible footholds and CoM trajectories to achieve statically stable locomotion on rough terrains, also in presence of load-intensive tasks. Key results of our approach include the efficiency in the computation of the feasible region using an Iterative Projection (IP) algorithm and the successful execution of hardware experiments on the HyQ robot, that was able to negotiate obstacles of moderate dimensions while carrying an extra 10-kg payload.

This gap appears to define a transition region in which sub-Neptune planets are believed to have lost their H/He envelopes, potentially by photoevaporation or core powered mass loss, and have thus been transformed into bare core terrestrial planets. Here we investigate the transition between sub-Neptunes and super-Earths using a real sample of observed small close-in planets and applying envelope evolution models of the H/He envelope together with the mass-radius diagram and a photoevaporation model. We find that photoevaporation can explain the H/He envelope loss of most super-Earths in 100 Myr, although an additional loss mechanism appears necessary in some planets. We explore the possibility that these planets' families have different core masses and find a continuum in the primordial population of the strongly irradiated super-Earths and the sub-Neptunes. Our analysis also shows that close-orbiting sub-Neptunes withR R(circle plus)typically lose similar to 30% of their primordial envelope.

However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values. Our results pave the way for novel applications, including programmable quantum metrology and hybrid atom-ion systems, and set the stage for alkaline-earth based quantum computing architectures.

Multiscale Surface Roughness for Improved Soil Moisture Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Passive microwave; soil moisture (SM); soil moisture active passive (SMAP); surface roughness	L-BAND; MICROWAVE EMISSION; DEPRESSIONAL STORAGE; WATER-CONTENT; RETRIEVAL; SMOS; BARE; VEGETATION; TILLAGE; MODEL	Surface roughness parameterization plays an important role in passive microwave soil moisture (SM) retrieval. This article proposes a new formulation for estimating surface roughness. The proposed model incorporates the field-scale (micro) roughness as well as topographic (macro) roughness. The performance of the model is evaluated by inverting the traditional tau-omega model for retrieving SM. The study focuses on the passive active L-band system (PALS) radiometer data collected as a part of two Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX), i.e., SMAPVEX12 (humid Manitoba, Canada) and SMAPVEX15 (semiarid Arizona, USA) with highly different microroughness and macroroughness. The measured surface roughness is observed to increase exponentially with clay fraction (CF). This behavior is minimized with increase in leaf area index (LAI). In the absence of vegetation, the contribution of topography toward surface roughness increases. A higher surface roughness value is estimated for SMAPVEX12, which positively correlate with LAI and CF and negatively correlate with wetness conditions. On the other hand, due to the high topographic variability in SMAPVEX15 region, the contribution of topography (surface curvature) toward total surface roughness is significant. Also, consistently dry SM resulted in high microroughness for SMAPVEX15. Nevertheless, a total surface roughness estimated for SMAPVEX15 region is less than for SMAPVEX12. The surface roughness formulation presented in this study can be extrapolated to any spatial resolution.

An FPGA-Based Signal Processor for FMCW Doppler Radar and Spectroscopy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Radar theory; millimeter-wave Doppler radar; spectroscopy		We report on the design and development of a field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based radar and spectrometer signal processor. It leverages an efficient implementation of a fixed-point frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) Doppler radar algorithm and has been demonstrated in a short-range W-band radar system developed for mapping plume and jet phenomena in the solar system. The signal processor also performs Fourier transform-based spectroscopy with a resolution, bandwidth, and averaging time appropriate for millimeter- and submillimeter-wave passive remote sensing in space. With a dc power consumption totaling only 3 W, the processor helps make the Doppler radar and spectrometer instrument well-suited for spaceborne, airborne, or portable platforms. Here, we describe the fixed-point implementation of the radar and spectrometer algorithm, emphasizing its computational efficiency for low resource utilization, and provide examples of Doppler radar sensing of rain and spectrometer sensitivity to hot and cold blackbody loads.

The software facilitates combined estimation of geodetic and geophysical parameters using a Kalman filter approach on real or simulated data in both post -processing and in real-time. The estimated parameters include station coordinates and velocities, satellite orbits and clocks, Earth orientation, ionospheric and tropospheric delays. The software is also capable of full realiza- tion of a dynamic terrestrial reference through analysis and combination of time series of ground station coordinates. Applying lessons learned from its predecessors, GIPSY -OASIS and Real Time GIPSY (RTG), GipsyX/RTGx was re -designed from the ground up to offer improved precision, accuracy, usability, and operational flexibility. We present some key aspects of its new archi- tecture, and describe some of its major applications, including Real-time orbit determination and ephemeris predictions in the U.S. Air Force Next Generation GPS Operational Control Segment (OCX), as well as in JPL?s Global Differential GPS (GDGPS) System, sup- porting User Range Error (URE) of <5 cm RMS; precision post -processing GNSS orbit determination, including JPL?s contributions to the International GNSS Service (IGS) with URE in the 2 cm RMS range; Precise point positioning (PPP) with ambiguity resolution, both statically and kinematically, for geodetic applications with 2 mm horizontal, and 6.5 mm vertical repeatability for static positioning; Operational orbit and clock determination for Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, such as NASA?s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission with GRACE relative clock alignment at the 20 ps level; calibration of radio occultation data from LEO satellites for weather forecasting and climate studies; Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) to GNSS and LEO satellites, DORIS-based and multi -technique orbit determination for LEO; production of terrestrial reference frames and Earth rotation parameters in support of JPL?s contribution to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).

Empirical rovibrational energy levels of ammonia up to 7500 cm(-1)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Ammonia ((NH3)-N-14); Rovibrational transitions; Empirical rovibrational energy levels; MARVEL; Database; Spectroscopic networks; Effective Hamiltonian fits	ROTATIONAL-VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA; IUPAC CRITICAL-EVALUATION; TRANSITION WAVE-NUMBERS; MICROWAVE 2-PHOTON SPECTROSCOPY; LASER HETERODYNE MEASUREMENTS; FOURIER-TRANSFORM SPECTRA; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTRUM; MOLECULAR LINE LISTS; HYPERFINE-STRUCTURE; ABSORPTION-SPECTRUM	The most recent version of the MARVEL (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) protocol and code is used to update and extend the list of accurately known empirical rovibrational energy levels of (NH3)-N-14 falling in the range of 0 - 7500 cm(-1) . Compared to an earlier similar study covering all the measured transitions of (NH3)-N-14 [22], the present investigation is limited to transitions with an upper energy level below 7500 cm(-1) , considers 82 sources (28 new) of transitions data, corrects several older assignments, and utilizes an improved validation procedure based partially on high-quality first-principles rovibrational energies. This study yields 4936 uniquely labelled empirical rovibrational energy levels, the set is complete up to 2413 cm(-1). We confirm the overall high accuracy of the most recent "spectroscopic" (fitted) (NH3)-N-14 potential energy surface, C2018, up to 7500 cm(-1). Investigation of energy values resulting from previous effective-Hamiltonian fits forms an important part of this study. It is established that previous effective-Hamiltonian fits, using high expansion orders in the Hamiltonian, are inaccurate for certain high rotational excitations of all vibrational parents considered. Employing the ground vibrational state as a test case, it is shown that the origin of the problem is that the observed (NH3)-N-14 spectroscopic network formed by rotational transitions and used for the effective-Hamiltonian fit contains floating components. A much improved effective-Hamiltonian fit is presented whereby the floating components are connected to the principal components of the spectroscopic network by carefully selected first-principles links. It is recommended that for all molecules the experimental set of transitions employed for an effective Hamiltonian fit should be checked for floating components and extra care be exercised if they exist, as in these cases the adequate reproduction of the transitions does not automatically mean that the energies derived from the effective-Hamiltonian parameters are correct as well. The connectivity problem of measured spectroscopic networks becomes more and more pronounced as the order of the Hamiltonian is increased. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pseudoline parameters to represent n-butane (n-C4H10) cross-sections measured in the 7-15 mu m region for the Titan atmosphere	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						n-Butane; FT-IR spectrum; Cross section; Pseudolines; Balker 125HR; Cassini/CIRS; Titan; Hydrocarbons	PHOTOCHEMISTRY; NITROGEN; C3H8	We measured temperature-dependent cross-sections of n-butane (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3) in the mid-infrared (7-15 mu m) region in support of remote sensing for the Titan's atmosphere. For this, 28 pure and N-2-mixture spectra were obtained at 180-298 K using a high-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker IFS 125 HR) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The spectral resolutions were selected to be between 0.0039 and 0.06 cm(-1), depending on the sample pressures. The observed spectra were fit simultaneously to generate one single set of pseudolines, which include line intensities and lower state energies at individual pseudoline positions. The observed spectra could be reproduced by the pseudolines to within 4% through line-by-line radiative transfer calculations. The integrated intensities at 296 K were measured to be 5.06(28), 7.18(27), 0.91(4), and 49.01(20) x 10(-19) cm(-1) /(molecule.cm(-2)) in the 660860, 860-1060, 1060-1200, and 1200-1538 cm(-1) regions, respectively, by summing up the pseudoline intensity parameters. These results are observed to be significantly lower than that of the PNNL (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) cross-sections obtained at low resolution. The pseudolines are electronically compiled in the HITRAN database format, which can be readily integrated with existing radiative transfer calculations. The measured cross-sections represented by the pseudolines could provide critical laboratory input in search of elusive species that might be captured in the Cassini/CIRS and the JWST/MIRI spectral observations.

Out of this sample, four stars (TYC 7443-1102-1, TYC 9340-437-1, GJ 784 and GJ 707) have infrared excesses above their stellar photospheres at either 100 or 160 mu m or both. At 100 microns TYC 9340-437-1 is spatially resolved with a shape that suggests it is surrounded by a face-on disk. The 100 mu m excess flux associated with GJ 707 is marginal at around 3 sigma. The excess flux associated with GJ 784 is most likely due to a background galaxy as the dust radius estimated from the spectral energy fit implies that any associated dust disk should have been resolved in the Herschel images but is not. TYC 7443-1102-1 has been observed with ALMA which resolves the emission at its location into two distinct sources making the Herschel excess most likely also due to a background galaxy. It is worth noting that this star is in the 23 Myr old beta Pic association. With a disk luminosity on the order of 10(-3)L(*), this system is an ideal follow-up target for high-contrast imaging and ALMA.

Reducing Doppler noise with multi-station tracking: The Cassini test case	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Radio science; Cassini; Noise budget; Orbit determination	GRAVITY-FIELD; INTERIOR STRUCTURE	Doppler tracking of Solar System probes is used for spacecraft navigation, planetary geodesy, and tests of the theory of General Relativity. The spacecraft radial velocity is measured by observing the Doppler shift of a radio signal transmitted from an Earth station to the spacecraft and then re-transmitted back, while preserving phase coherence, to the same station (two-way link) or to a different station (three-way link). Specialized orbit determination software is then used to reconstruct the spacecraft trajectory and estimate planetary gravity field coefficients or relativistic parameters. The measurement noise is a crucial element for the accuracy of the final estimates, thus considerable effort has been devoted to improve the range rate accuracy by adopting higher frequency links to reduce the dispersive noise from interplanetary and ionospheric plasmas, and by calibrating the tropospheric path delays with microwave radiometers. While Ka-band radio links (32-34 GHz) allowed a successful suppression of plasma noise, reducing tropospheric noise and ground antenna mechanical noise has been more challenging. The Time-Delay Mechanical noise Cancellation (TDMC) technique is a promising method to reduce mechanical and tropospheric noises and to improve further the accuracy of Doppler measurements. The TDMC is a linear combination of simultaneous Doppler data from a main antenna providing the two-way link and a three-way antenna (generally smaller and stiffer). If the listen-only, three-way antenna is also located in a particularly dry site, the TDMC can considerably reduce both tropospheric and antenna mechanical noises, which are the leading disturbances in two-way Ka-band radio links. For an operational WA of this method, we applied the TDMC to Doppler data at X-band (7.2-8.4 GHz) from the Cassini spacecraft acquired during the Saturn tour phase of the mission. Although X-band links are generally dominated by the highly-variable interplanetary plasma noise and are not suitable for the TDMC, we found that, when local noises are particularly large at the two-way antenna, this technique may still lead to up to a factor-of-three noise reduction (at 60-s integration time) with respect to the two-way link. The TDMC can maximize the data quality during unique events, mainly planetary or satellite flybys (such as those considered in the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions), where the scientific results could be severely hampered by adverse conditions at the tracking station.

Lunar Flashlight CubeSat GNC system development	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	69th International Astronautical Congress (IAC)	OCT 01-05, 2018	Bremen, GERMANY			Guidance; Navigation; Control; SmallSat; CubeSat; Lunar		JPL is developing the Lunar Flashlight (LF) CubeSat mission, a 6U 14 kg spacecraft whose objective is to demonstrate new technology and measure potential surface water ice deposits in the permanently shadowed region (PSR) of the moon in preparation of future possible human lunar exploration. This mission will become the first interplanetary CubeSat to orbit the Moon. It uses a new green propulsion system as well as an instrument with spectrally tuned IR laser technology to search for volatiles in a specific region of the moon. The Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system is crucial for delivering the spacecraft from Earth into Lunar orbit and supporting scientific measurements. Due to the challenging lunar orbit insertion and high tip off rate out of launch vehicle's dispenser, the initial design concept using solar sail propulsion accompanied with small commercial-on-the-shelf (COTS) reaction wheels was abandoned mid-course and replaced by a green propulsion system along with larger reaction wheels, both newly developed for LF. However, using thrusters for the small CubeSat created an additional challenge of controlling the spacecraft attitude. The story of the GNC system development, qualifications, technical challenges encountered, and lessons learned are discussed in this paper.

Enabling new exploration opportunities on planetary surfaces: In situ geochemical characterization in soils by dielectric spectroscopy onboard the AXEL rover system	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ICE; ROCKS; MODEL	In the work, we present dielectric spectroscopy (DS) is an analytical method capable of characterizing and quantifying electrochemically active materials (water/ice, ions, etc.) in planetary regoliths. Detection of these materials occurs when a small amount of energy is applied to an in situ sample, causing perturbation in the form of potential kinetic energy and inducing polarization and/or relaxation processes in materials of interest. The frequency dispersion on the electrical properties of impendences, relative permittivity, and conductivity spectra represents chemical and physical properties in association with inherent material properties. Therefore, measuring these energetic states can provide a unique fingerprint of the materials, depending on the frequencies that are scanned. In the case of water content in soils, the Debye equivalent circuit model can accurately predict its electrical properties and provide excellent quantification of the water content in soils. Use of DS is enabled by miniaturization of the key components and the low power requirements. DS is therefore capable of offering substantial scientific returns as an in situ sampling and non-destructive measurement technique, making it ideally suitable for deployment onboard many smaller space exploratory platforms. This work reports the first deployment use of DS from a field test for geochemical characterization of in situ soils, specifically on the quantification of water onboard the AXEL mobility system in the Mojave Desert. Laboratory testing has confirmed the sensitivity of DS with respect to particle size (fine vs coarse) determination as well as water content (down to 0.01 wt%) under a wide range of environmental conditions. Water content associated with bound and bulk water was uniquely identified in the soil mixture. We also describe a field demonstration using DS using two distinct insertion dielectric probes specifically design for sub-surface measurements, verifying their mechanical robustness and chemical stability. The field measurements are in good agreement with laboratory data and effectively quantified water content at about 3.0 wt% and 8.0 wt% for field test sites #1 and #2, respectively.

Fracture geometry and statistics of Ceres' floor fractures	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Ceres; Dwarf planet; Floor fractured craters	VISCOUS RELAXATION; CRATERS; ORIGIN; INTRUSIONS; FEATURES; SYSTEM; VESTA; VENUS; SHAPE; MARS	Floor-fractured craters are one of the most distinct features on Ceres. Most of the fractures are located on the crater floors. The floor-fractures are concentric, radial or polygonal and share similarities with the floor-fractured craters (FCC) of Class 1 and 4 on the Moon (e.g., Buczkowski et al., 2018; Schultz, 1976) In total we measured 2336 fractures in thirteen craters. We analyzed their width, length, orientation and density. Floor-fractures on Ceres do not show a global uniform sense of orientation. Nevertheless, two or more preferred orientations can be found in nearly every crater. The density map illustrates that there is typically no decrease of fracturing from the crater center to the crater rim and denotes formation mechanisms that are not necessarily impact driven. Because of the variation in these parameters, it is more likely that FFC on Ceres are globally independent and show different formation mechanisms. The geometry of the floor-fractures suggests an inhomogeneous, brittle surface material, in some cases with volatile components. We also propose that the formation mechanisms on Ceres are comparable to those on the Moon and Mars and such mechanisms include cooling/melting processes, degassing, and subsidence of the crater floor by up-doming of subsurface material as a result of absolute tensile stresses.

J	Peters, ST; Schroeder, DM; Romero-Wolf, A				Peters, Sean T.; Schroeder, Dustin M.; Romero-Wolf, Andrew			Passive radio sounding to correct for Europa's ionospheric distortion of VHF signals	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Europa; REASON; Passive radar; Jovian noise; Ionospheric distortion; TEC estimation	MARS IONOSPHERE; RADAR SOUNDER; THICKNESS; JUPITER; SUN	The dispersive effect of Europa's ionosphere on radio wave propagation is detrimental to the quality of radar observations for altimetry and geodesy of Europa's surface, as it creates pulse broadening and signal delay. While using the relative delay between two active radar channels of different center frequencies is a common method to correct for this ionospheric distortion, the High Frequency (HF) active band for a dual-frequency radar sounder like the Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON) is susceptible to being dominated by the bursts of Jupiter's radio emissions when the radar is on the sub-Jovian side. At these times, the HF radar will be severely degraded or unusable alongside the slightly dispersed Very High Frequency (VHF) channel for performing radar sounding as well as reference-based radar corrections of ionospheric distortion for VHF altimetry. To address this, we assess the potential to use Jupiter's radio emissions to correct for ionospheric distortion with a passive radio sounding approach that has been developed on Earth to estimate the thickness of ice sheets using the Sun. With REASON as an interesting test case for the technique, we discuss in general the abilities and requirements for a dual-frequency radar system using a passive HF radar alongside an active VHF radar to correct for ionospheric distortion, and we compare the passive mode's performance to that of an active HF radar system. Finally, we show that even in the presence of the maximum expected total electron content (TEC) in Europa's ionosphere, the passive radar approach, using the REASON HF as a receive-only instrument, not only corrects for dispersion but also performs at a level similar to that of an active HF system in terms of TEC estimation and VHF range error reduction.

Retrievals of the column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index and single scattering albedo (SSA) in the UV-Vis range have been performed at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, since 2016 by combining co-located measurements from the NASA Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Cimel sun-sky photometer, the Ultraviolet Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (UV-MFRSR), the SKYNET Prede sky radiometer, and the NASA Pandora sun spectrometer. We investigated the spectral variation of column-averaged imaginary part of refractive index for UV-Vis wavelengths to refine models used in our aerosol retrieval algorithm to process measurements from the upcoming Geostationary Environment Monitoring Satellite (GEMS). The retrieved imaginary part of refractive index for highly absorbing fine pollution particles (BC), dust (DS), and non-absorbing (NA) particles in the selected UV-Vis range (380-440 nm) showed 0-20%, 30%, and 0-40% of spectral dependence, respectively. Retrievals of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) measurement data using the improved aerosol model showed improved correlation with AERONET data compared to the old algorithm that did not properly account for aerosol absorption effects. These results corroborate the advantage of using local climatology derived from ground-based UV-Vis spectral aerosol absorption measurements for satellite GEMS aerosol retrievals over East Asia. Moreover, this study reveals that spectral variations in the UV column aerosol absorption in East Asia differ from those in other regions.

Previous work in the field has shown the ability of GNSS-R to observe the global surface water distribution by generating dynamic maps of wetlands and other inundated areas. These maps can be generated by leveraging the large difference in received power of the GNSS signals as they reflect from water surfaces compared to land. In this paper, we utilize a full-forward scattering model approach to evaluate the accuracy of these maps. The CYGNSS End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was extended to include the contributions from coherent surface scattering in heterogeneous regions where the area around the specular point contains both water and land in complex geometries. The simulator is then used to analyze the accuracy of a current approach to estimate the surface water content in the first Fresnel zone from a single measurement, called a fractional water in footprint approach. We find that contributions to the total received power by the scattering from outside the first Fresnel zone as well as CYGNSS instrument effects impact the accuracy of this approach. Furthermore, the measured signal from calibration scattering targets is compared to the results of simulation to validate the scattering model. The work shows that the variability of the peak reflected power over inland bodies of water due to the scene heterogeneities should be accounted for in designing retrieval algorithms to map wetland extent.

This study aims to (1) assess the cause of the dam breach, and (2) understand the hydrologic and geomorphic impact of the flood. Our analysis shows that the collapse of the dam occurred as the reservoir was nearly full, and the water level was rising against the inner slope of the earthen dam. As the water discharged through the breach, we calculate that the reservoir fell similar to 22 m and lost similar to 350 million m(3). more than a third of the total stored volume on July 23. Inspection of publicly available photographs of the failed dam confirms our interpretation that the failure was structural, involving both piping and rotational slumping, and not due to overtopping of the dam. Failure to properly process the local materials before construction of the earth-core of the dam is the likely cause of failure. Our analysis of satellite imagery, bolstered by field observations, reveals that the flooding inundated an area of similar to 46 km(2) of villages and rural land in the Vang Ngao River, a tributary of the Mekong River basin. By using 1D and 2D hydrological modeling, we calculate a peak flood discharge of similar to 8500 m(3)/s, about half the mean discharge of the Mississippi River. The dam failure and concomitant losses are consistent with common inadequacies in this region in assessing potential hazards, challenges of geomorphological-geotechnical engineering when using tropical materials for construction, and emergency planning and warning. Thus, this analysis has important implications for the safer design and construction of the myriad of other dams that are either operating or planned within the multi-national Mekong River basin.

Assessment of water content in martian subsurface along the traverse of the Curiosity rover based on passive measurements of the DAN instrument	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Mars surface; Neutron spectroscopy; Water	LABORATORYS DYNAMIC ALBEDO; YELLOWKNIFE BAY; NEUTRON MEASUREMENTS; EXPERIMENT ONBOARD; RAY SPECTROMETER; MARS; HYDROGEN; SOLS; SOIL	This paper presents the method of estimating water-equivalent hydrogen (WEH) content from neutron sensing data that were measured by the Dynamic Albedo of Neutron (DAN) instrument onboard the Curiosity rover. Analyzed data are derived from the DAN passive operations, when the instrument measures the flux of neutron albedo from the surface, which is produced by bombardment by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and irradiation from Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) installed onboard the rover. The suggested Method of Referencing by Active Data (MRAD) for the analysis of DAN passive data is compared with the previously suggested Method of Numerical Simulation (MNS, see Tate et al. 2015, 2018 and 2019) for the analysis of DAN passive data: the qualitative agreement between them is shown with some systematic increase of WEH for the second one. The possible reason for that is explained in Section 6. Results for the DAN passive data analysis by MRAD are presented obtained for almost 20 km of the rover's traverse (until November 2, 2018 or sol 2218). The range of WEH average concentration of (2.6 +/- 0.7) wt% is found for this part of the traverse, which is consistent with a method of active neutron sensing (Mitrofanov et al., 2014, 2016; Lisov et al., 2018).

Satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) products have revealed hot spots of photosynthesis over global croplands, such as in the U.S. Midwest. However, to what extent these satellite-based SIF products can enhance the performance of crop yield prediction when benchmarking against other existing satellite data remains unclear. Here we assessed the benefits of using three satellite-based SIF products in yield prediction for maize and soybean in the U.S. Midwest: gap-filled SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 OCO-2), new SIF retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and the coarse-resolution SIF retrievals from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The yield prediction performances of using SIF data were benchmarked with those using satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and land surface temperature (LST). Five machine-learning algorithms were used to build yield prediction models with both remote-sensing-only and climate-remote-sensing-combined variables. We found that high-resolution SIF products from OCO-2 and TROPOMI outperformed coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF product in crop yield prediction. Using high-resolution SIF products gave the best forward predictions for both maize and soybean yields in 2018, indicating the great potential of using satellite-based high-resolution SIF products for crop yield prediction. However, using currently available high-resolution SIF products did not guarantee consistently better yield prediction performances than using other satellite-based remote sensing variables in all the evaluated cases. The relative performances of using different remote sensing variables in yield prediction depended on crop types (maize or soybean), out-of-sample testing methods (fivefold-cross-validation or forward), and record length of training data. We also found that using NIRv could generally lead to better yield prediction performance than using NDVI, EVI, or LST, and using NIRv could achieve similar or even better yield prediction performance than using OCO-2 or TROPOMI SIF products. We concluded that satellite-based SIF products could be beneficial in crop yield prediction with more high-resolution and good-quality SIF products accumulated in the future.

The typical downsides are spatial and temporal gaps and potentially low data quality. Meaning-ful statistical inference from such data requires overcoming these problems and developing efficient and robust computational tools. We design and implement a computationally efficient multi-scale Gaussian process (GP) software pack-age, satGP, geared towards remote sensing applications. The software is able to handle problems of enormous sizes and to compute marginals and sample from the random field conditioning on at least hundreds of millions of observations. This is achieved by optimizing the computation by, e.g., randomization and splitting the problem into parallel local subproblems which aggressively discard uninformative data. We describe the mean function of the Gaussian process by approximating marginals of a Markov random field (MRF). Variability around the mean is modeled with a multi-scale covariance kernel, which consists of Matern, exponential, and periodic components. We also demonstrate how winds can be used to inform covariances locally. The covariance kernel parameters are learned by calculating an approximate marginal maximum likelihood estimate, and the validity of both the multi-scale approach and the method used to learn the kernel parameters is verified in synthetic experiments. We apply these techniques to a moderate size ozone data set produced by an atmospheric chemistry model and to the very large number of observations retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. The satGP software is released under an open-source license.

When low Earth-orbiting satellites reenter the atmosphere at end of mission, a measure to mitigate the generation of space debris, operators must limit the number of satellite components that reach the ground to ensure public safety. Inductively coupled plasma using an argon/air mixture to simulate reentry conditions is used to study ablation of BMG and conventional spacecraft alloys. Differential scanning calorimetry is used to determine the thermal properties of the alloys. BMGs are shown to ablate similarly to aluminum alloys (Al7075) and dramatically faster than titanium alloys (Ti-6Al-4V).

Damage to the reservoir's spillway infrastructure necessitated evacuation of 188,000 people; subsequent infrastructure repairs cost $1 billion. We assess the atmospheric conditions, snowmelt, and runoff against major historical events. The event generated exceptional runoff volumes (second largest in a 30-yr record) partially at odds with the event precipitation totals (ninth largest). We explain the discrepancy with observed record melt of deep antecedent snowpack, heavy rainfall extending to unusually high elevations, and high water vapor transport during the atmospheric river storms. An analysis of distributed snow water equivalent indicates that snowmelt increased water available for runoff watershed-wide by 37% (25-52% at 90% confidence). The results highlight potential threats to public safety and infrastructure associated with a warmer and more variable climate.	[Henn, Brian; Ralph, F.

Wintertime Particulate Matter Decrease Buffered by Unfavorable Chemical Processes Despite Emissions Reductions in China	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SECONDARY AEROSOL CONTRIBUTION; PM2.5 AIR-QUALITY; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; METEOROLOGICAL MODES; INORGANIC AEROSOLS; BOUNDARY-LAYER; CMAQ MODEL; POLLUTION; NITRATE; OZONE	Extreme and persistent haze events frequently occur during wintertime China. While recent emissions reductions reduced annual mean fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over eastern China, their effectiveness on wintertime PM2.5 trend remains uncertain. We use observations and model simulations to quantify seasonal differences in PM2.5 trends and investigate the underlying chemical mechanisms driving such differences. We find a much slower decrease in observed wintertime PM2.5 (-3.2% yr(-1)) since 2014, in contrast to a drastic summertime decrease (-10.3% yr(-1)). Simulations show two previously underappreciated mechanisms buffering wintertime PM2.5 decrease, including an increase in oxidation capacity due to nitrogen oxides (NOx) reductions under wintertime volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited chemistry, and an enhanced conversion of nitric acid to nitrate by ammonia due to sulfur dioxide reductions. Our findings suggest that control policies targeting VOC and deep NO(x)reductions are needed to improve wintertime PM2.5 air quality over China. Plain Language Summary Severe wintertime particulate matter (PM) pollution in China is an important environmental problem causing hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Recent emissions reductions have gradually improved annual mean PM air quality in eastern China. However, our observational analysis unexpectedly shows a much weaker decrease in PM during winter compared with other seasons. State-of-the-art model simulations suggest that the weakened wintertime PM decline is mainly attributed to the increase in wintertime atmospheric oxidation capacity and the enhanced conversion of nitric acid to nitrate by ammonia, which are induced by anthropogenic emission reductions. Our findings indicate that previous pollution control policies did not effectively mitigate severe wintertime PM pollution due to these unfavored chemical processes. Stricter control policies targeting oxidants and wintertime emission sources are imperative to counteract the buffering chemical mechanisms over China.

Changes to these precipitation intensities,P, with long-term modes of climate variability have been hard to assess because they are not well represented in current climate models. Here we stratify a satellite climatology of convective systems by El Nino phase and cloud top temperature. We find that gains (losses) in high precipitation intensity (P & x2d9;> 10 mm hr(-1)) are largest for the deepest (least deep) systems during El Nino relative to La Nina. The surface temperature and wind changes that define El Nino manifest as surface flux changes but are not sufficient to explain theseP & x2d9;trends. We explore also the dynamical component of precipitation generation with a vertical momentum budget. Midtropospheric drying in the vicinity of the deepest systems boosts instability and ascent rates during El Nino, while the strengthened large-scale ascent minimizes the drag force on their updrafts.

In this paper, we first discuss the expected noise sources in TKIDs and derive the limits where the phonon noise contribution dominates over the other detector noise terms: generation-recombination, amplifier, and two-level system noise. Second, we characterize aluminum TKIDs in a dark environment. We present measurements of TKID resonators with quality factors of about 10 5 at 80mK. We also discuss the bolometer thermal conductance, heat capacity, and time constants. These were measured by the use of a resistor on the thermal island to excite the bolometers. These dark aluminum TKIDs demonstrate a noise equivalent power, NEP = 2 x 10 - 17 W / Hz , with a 1 / f knee at 0.1Hz, which provides background noise limited performance for ground-based telescopes observing at 150GHz.

J	Jiang, XN; Maloney, E; Su, H				Jiang, Xianan; Maloney, Eric; Su, Hui			Large-scale controls of propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation	NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE			English	Article							INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION; MJO PROPAGATION; MOISTURE MODES; CONVERGENCE; SIMULATION; BIAS	With widespread influence on global climate and weather extremes, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) plays a crucial role in subseasonal prediction. Our latest global climate models (GCMs), however, have great difficulty in realistically simulating the MJO. This model inability is largely due to problems in representation of MJO's cumulus organization. This study, based on a series of idealized aqua-planet model experiments using an atmospheric-only GCM, clearly demonstrates that MJO propagation is strongly modulated by the large-scale background state in which the lower-tropospheric mean moisture gradient and zonal winds are critical. Therefore, when tuning climate models to achieve improved MJO simulations, particular attention needs to be placed on the model large-scale mean state that is also significantly affected by cumulus parameterizations. This study indicates that model biases in representing MJO propagation may be related to the widely reported double-ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone) problem in climate models.

Unlike previous works, where crystal sizes demonstrated have been less than similar to 10 mu m, here, we show that by tuning the crystal growth conditions, crystals with dimensions greater than 100 mu m and of high electron mobility can be directly grown on oxides. Specifically, InAs-on-oxide with mobilities reaching 5100cm(2)/Vs at 100K, and similar to 3200cm(2)/Vs at room temperature has been demonstrated. The excellent electronic performance is due to the single crystallinity of the grown material and creates new avenues for the monolithic direct integration of high-performance materials on non-epitaxial substrates, including silicon, and amorphous substrates, such as glasses and metals.

GPU-accelerated massive black hole binary parameter estimation with LISA	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DIRECT COLLAPSE; ACCRETION; SELECTION; WAVES	The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is slated for launch in the early 2030s. A main target of the mission is massive black hole binaries that have an expected detection rate of similar to 20 yr(-) (1). We present a parameter estimation analysis for a variety of massive black hole binaries. This analysis is performed with a graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation comprising the PhenomHM waveform with higher-order harmonic modes and aligned spins; a fast frequency-domain LISA detector response function; and a GPU-native likelihood computation. The computational performance achieved with the GPU is shown to be 500 times greater than with a similar CPU implementation, which allows us to analyze full noise-infused injections at a realistic Fourier bin width for the LISA mission in a tractable and efficient amount of time. With these fast likelihood computations, we study the effect of adding aligned spins to an analysis with higher-order modes by testing different configurations of spins in the injection, as well as the effect of varied and fixed spins during sampling. Within these tests, we examine three different binaries with varying mass ratios, redshifts, sky locations, and detector-frame total masses ranging over 3 orders of magnitude. We discuss varied correlations between the total masses and mass ratios; unique spin posteriors for the larger mass binaries; and the constraints on parameters when fixing spins during sampling, allowing us to compare to previous analyses that did not include aligned spins.

Climate change impacts on GWS (groundwater storage) could affect the sustainability of freshwater resources. Here, we used a fully-coupled climate model to investigate GWS changes over seven critical aquifers identified as significantly distressed by satellite observations. We assessed the potential climate-driven impacts on GWS changes throughout the 21(st) century under the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Results show that the climate-driven impacts on GWS changes do not necessarily reflect the long-term trend in precipitation; instead, the trend may result from enhancement of evapotranspiration, and reduction in snowmelt, which collectively lead to divergent responses of GWS changes across different aquifers. Finally, we compare the climate-driven and anthropogenic pumping impacts. The reduction in GWS is mainly due to the combined impacts of over-pumping and climate effects; however, the contribution of pumping could easily far exceed the natural replenishment. Climate change may impact groundwater storage and thus the availability of freshwater resources. Here the authors use climate models to examine seven aquifers and find that storage changes are primarily the result of enhancement of evapotranspiration, reduction in snowmelt, and over-pumping rather than long-term precipitation changes.

This paper describes the experimental setup for process-based sea level change projections to be performed with stand-alone Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet models in the context of ISMIP6. The ISMIP6 protocol relies on a suite of polar atmospheric and oceanic CMIP-based forcing for ice sheet models, in order to explore the uncertainty in projected sea level change due to future emissions scenarios, CMIP models, ice sheet models, and parameterizations for ice-ocean interactions. We describe here the approach taken for defining the suite of ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, document the experimental framework and implementation, and present an overview of the ISMIP6 forcing to be used by participating ice sheet modeling groups.

MISMIP+ is intended to be a benchmark for ice-flow models which include fast sliding marine ice streams and floating ice shelves and in particular a treatment of viscous stress that is sufficient to model buttressing, where upstream ice flow is restrained by a downstream ice shelf. A set of idealized experiments first tests that models are able to maintain a steady state with the grounding line located on a retrograde slope due to buttressing and then explore scenarios where a reduction in that buttressing causes ice stream acceleration, thinning, and grounding line retreat. The majority of participating models passed the first test and then produced similar responses to the loss of buttressing. We find that the most important distinction between models in this particular type of simulation is in the treatment of sliding at the bed, with other distinctions - notably the difference between the simpler and more complete treatments of englacial stress but also the differences between numerical methods - taking a secondary role.

Electron Microprobe/SIMS Determinations of Al in Olivine: Applications to Solar Wind, Pallasites and Trace Element Measurements	GEOSTANDARDS AND GEOANALYTICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						olivine; aluminium; Genesis; electron probe microanalysis; SIMS	ION MICROPROBE	Electron probe microanalyser measurements of trace elements with high accuracy are challenging. Accurate Al measurements in olivine are required to calibrate SIMS implant reference materials for measurement of Al in the solar wind. We adopt a combined EPMA/SIMS approach that is useful for producing SIMS reference materials as well as for EPMA at the similar to 100 mu g g(-1) level. Even for mounts not polished with alumina photoelectron spectroscopy shows high levels of Al surface contamination. In order to minimise electron beam current density, a rastered 50 x 100 mu m electron beam was adequate and minimised sensitivity to small Al-rich contaminants. Reproducible analyses of eleven SIMS-cleaned spots on San Carlos olivine agreed at 69.3 +/- 1.0 mu g g(-1). The known Al mass fraction was used to calibrate an Al implant into San Carlos. Accurate measurements of Al were made for olivines in the pallasites: Imilac, Eagle Station and Springwater. Our focus was on Al in olivine, but our technique could be refined to give accurate electron probe measurements for other contamination-sensitive trace elements. For solar wind, it is projected that the Al/Mg abundance ratio can be determined to 6%, a factor of 2 more precise than the solar spectroscopic ratio.

Sensitivity of idealized mixed-phase stratocumulus to climate perturbations	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						Arctic stratocumulus; large-eddy simulation; mixed-layer model; mixed-phase clouds	LARGE-EDDY SIMULATIONS; CLOUD-TOP ENTRAINMENT; ARCTIC AIR FORMATION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; LAYER MODEL; SURFACE; PARAMETERIZATION; FEEDBACKS; MOISTURE; TRANSPORT	Large-eddy simulations (LESs) that explicitly resolve boundary layer (BL) turbulence and clouds are used to explore the sensitivity of idealized Arctic BL clouds to climate perturbations. The LESs focus on conditions resembling springtime, when surface heat fluxes over sea ice are weak, and the cloud radiative effect is dominated by the long-wave effect. In the LES, the condensed water path increases with BL temperature and free-tropospheric relative humidity, but it decreases with inversion strength. The dependencies of cloud properties on environmental variables exhibited by the LES can largely be reproduced by a mixed-layer model. Mixed-layer model analysis shows that the liquid water path increases with warming because the liquid water gradient increase under warming overcompensates for geometric cloud thinning. This response contrasts with the response of subtropical stratocumulus to warming, whose liquid water path decreases as the clouds thin geometrically under warming. The results suggest that methods used to explain the response of lower-latitude BL clouds to climate change can also elucidate changes in idealized Arctic BL clouds, although subtropical and Arctic clouds occupy different thermodynamic regimes.

The selection of species analysed contained a range of geometric isomers and differing functionalities, allowing for the impacts of these factors on saturation vapour pressure (P-sat) to be probed. Three subsets of nitroaromatics were investigated: nitrophenols, nitrobenzaldehydes and nitrobenzoic acids. The P-S(sat) values were converted to subcooled liquid saturation vapour pressure (P-L(sat)) values using experimental enthalpy of fusion and melting point values measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The P-L(sat) at values were compared to those estimated by predictive techniques and, with a few exceptions, were found to be up to 7 orders of magnitude lower. The large differences between the estimated P(L)(sat )and the experimental values can be attributed to the predictive techniques not containing parameters to adequately account for functional group positioning around an aromatic ring, or the interactions between said groups. When comparing the experimental P-S(sat) at of the measured compounds, the ability to hydrogen bond (H bond) and the strength of the H bond formed appear to have the strongest influence on the magnitude of the P-sat, with steric effects and molecular weight also being major factors. Comparisons were made between the KEMS system and data from diffusion-controlled evaporation rates of single partides in an electrodynamic balance (EDB). The KEMS and the EDB showed good agreement with each other for the compounds investigated.	[Shelley, Petroc D.; Bannan, Thomas J.; Alfarra, M.

Although most biometric methods require direct contact between a device and a subject, gait recognition has unique characteristics whereby interaction with the subjects is not required and can be performed from a distance. Cameras are commonly used for gait recognition, and a number of researchers have used depth information obtained using an RGB-D camera, such as the Microsoft Kinect. Although depth-based gait recognition has advantages, such as robustness against light conditions or appearance variations, there are also limitations. For instance, the RGB-D camera cannot be used outdoors and the measurement distance is limited to approximately 10 meters. The present paper describes a long short-term memory-based method for gait recognition using a real-time multi-line LiDAR. Very few studies have dealt with LiDAR-based gait recognition, and the present study is the first attempt that combines LiDAR data and long short-term memory for gait recognition and focuses on dealing with different appearances. We collect the first gait recognition dataset that consists of time-series range data for 30 people with clothing variations and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Mixed Hydrocarbon and Cyanide Ice Compositions for Titan's Atmospheric Aerosols: A Ternary-Phase Co-crystal Predicted by Density Functional Theory	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Titan aerosols; astrochemistry; molecular co-crystal; periodic DFT; hydrocarbon; hydrogen cyanide; IR spectroscopy; Raman spectroscopy	VIBRATIONAL FREQUENCIES; BENZENE; ACETONITRILE; ACETYLENE; DIFFRACTION; NAPHTHALENE; ETHANE	A benzene/acetylene/hydrogen cyanide co-crystal has been predicted using a periodic density functional theory approach based on the empirical structure of the 1:1 benzene and acetylene co-crystal. This example of a stable ternary-phase system-a three-component co-crystal comprising small neutral molecules-finds relevance as a possible Titan aerosol composition formed by the condensation of abundant volatile photoproducts in the lower stratosphere. Calculated thermochemical data confirm the 2C(6)H(6):C2H2:HCN co-crystal as a viable laboratory target, with free and cohesive energies competitive with those of binary-phase ices. Harmonic vibrational frequencies computed for the periodic system indicate that the co-crystal can be identified using low-frequency far-infrared or Raman spectroscopy, where distinctive intermolecular lattice signatures are predicted to lie. The geometry of the individual components within the unit cell appears optimal to promote ring-expansion chemistry upon ultraviolet or fast particle irradiation of the molecular co-crystal surface. Such co-crystal systems are unexplored in laboratory simulations of astrophysical ices and may have important implications for the solid-state formation of complex organic molecules in Titan's atmosphere.

Investigating the Impacts of Nonacyl Peroxy Nitrates on the Global Composition of the Troposphere Using a 3-D Chemical Transport Model, STOCHEM-CRI	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						upper troposphere; chemical transport model; surface distribution; zonal distribution; global budget; oxidation cycle; atmospheric lifetime; global fluxes; greenhouse gases	REACTIVE NITROGEN; RATE COEFFICIENTS; LAGRANGIAN MODEL; BRANCHING RATIOS; LIGHTNING NOX; OZONE; MECHANISM; PART; CH3O2NO2; PAN	Nonacyl peroxy nitrates, RO2NO2, act as a reservoir species for NOx in the upper troposphere. The low thermal stability of these compounds means that they only become a significant sink of NOx at the low temperatures observed in the upper troposphere. The chemical processes involved with the formation and degradation of methyl peroxy nitrate (CH3O2NO2) and an additional 44 RO2NO2 have been incorporated into the global three-dimensional chemical transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. The study investigates the effect of the addition of RO2NO2 chemistry on the budget of NOx, which in turn impacts the ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH), and nitrate radical (NO3) formation. This investigation found that the addition of CH3O2NO2 led to an increase in the tropospheric burdens of NOx (+3.0%), ozone (+2.0%), OH (+4.0%), and NO3 (+8.8%). However, the other 44 RO2NO2 contribute a significant increment of tropospheric global burdens of NQ (+4.4%), ozone (+3.4%), OH (+5.5%), and NO3 (+11.1%) with the largest mixing ratios of NOx of up to 25%, ozone up to 14%, OH up to 20%, and NO3 up to 50%. The increase in the global burden of oxidizing species such as OH due to the addition of 44 other RO2NO2 led to a significant decrease in the lifetimes of greenhouse gases such as methane (similar to 6%). The modeled mixing ratios of CH3O2NO2 were in reasonable agreement with measurements, the only extensive data set available.	[Khan, M.

The scan included firn and glacial ice and demonstrated that the instrument is able to determine small (mm) and large (cm) scale regions of organic matter concentration and discriminate spectral types of organic matter at high resolution. Both a linear point cloud scanning mode and a raster mapping mode were used to detect and localize microbial and organic matter "hotspots" embedded in the ice. Our instrument revealed diverse spectral signatures. Most hotspots were <20 mm in diameter, clearly isolated from other hotspots, and distributed stochastically; there was no evidence of layering in the ice at the fine scales examined (100 mu m per pixel). The spectral signatures were consistent with organic matter fluorescence from microbes, lignins, fused-ring aromatic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and biologically derived materials such as fulvic acids.In situdetection of organic matter hotspots in ice prevents loss of spatial information and signal dilution when compared with traditional bulk analysis of ice core meltwaters. Our methodology could be useful for detecting microbial and organic hotspots in terrestrial icy environments and on future missions to the Ocean Worlds of our Solar System.

Erythemal Radiation, Column Ozone, and the North American Monsoon	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						erythemal; convection; monsoon	EXTRATROPICAL LOWER STRATOSPHERE; CONTINENTAL UNITED-STATES; WATER-VAPOR; CONVECTION; PRECIPITATION; LAYER; HCL	Recently, Anderson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1222978, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619318114) and Anderson and Clapp (2018, https://doi.org/10.1039/C7CP08331A) proposed that summertime convectively injected water vapor over North America could lead to stratospheric ozone depletion through halogenic catalytic reactions. Such ozone loss would reduce the ozone column and increase erythemal daily dose (EDD). Using 10 years of observations over the North American monsoon region from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument, we find that the column ozone and EDD has a similar to 0.8-0.9 spatial correlation with lower stratospheric water vapor measured by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder. We show that this correlation appears to be due to the elevation of the monsoonal tropopause and associated monsoonal convection. The increase in tropopause altitude reduces the ozone column and increases EDD. We see no apparent evidence of substantial heterogeneous chemical ozone loss in lower stratospheric ozone coincident with the stratospheric monsoonal water vapor enhancement. Plain Language Summary Anomalously high surface ultraviolet (UV) radiation is present over southwest United States during the July-August North American monsoon. This elevated radiation results from the lifting of the tropopause and subsequent reduction of the ozone column. Simultaneously, water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) increases as a result of the monsoon convection. Thus, summer monsoon increases in UV radiation and the erythemal daily dosage are correlated with enhanced UTLS water vapor, but this correlation does not appear to be a signal of unusual stratospheric chemical ozone loss.

The interaction of fluorescence with photochemistry at the leaf and canopy scales provides opportunities to diagnose and constrain model simulations of photosynthesis and related processes, through direct comparison to and assimilation of tower, airborne, and satellite data. TBMs describe key processes related to the absorption of sunlight, leaf-level fluorescence emission, scattering, and reabsorption throughout the canopy. Here, we analyze simulations from an ensemble of process-based TBM-SIF models (SiB3 - Simple Bio-sphere Model, SiB4, CLM4.5 - Community Land Model, CLM5.0, BETHY - Biosphere Energy Transfer Hydrology, ORCHIDEE - Organizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems, and BEPS - Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator) and the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photosynthesis Energy) canopy radiation and vegetation model at a subalpine evergreen needleleaf forest near Niwot Ridge, Colorado. These models are forced with local meteorology and analyzed against tower-based continuous far-red SIF and gross-primary-productivity-partitioned (GPP) eddy covariance data at diurnal and synoptic scales during the growing season (July-August 2017). Our primary objective is to summarize the site-level state of the art in TBM-SIF modeling over a relatively short time period (summer) when light, canopy structure, and pigments are similar, setting the stage for regional- to global-scale analyses. We find that these models are generally well constrained in simulating photosynthetic yield but show strongly divergent patterns in the simulation of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), absolute GPP and fluorescence, quantum yields, and light response at the leaf and canopy scales. This study highlights the need for mechanistic modeling of non-photochemical quenching in stressed and unstressed environments and improved the representation of light absorption (APAR), distribution of light across sunlit and shaded leaves, and radiative transfer from the leaf to the canopy scale.

High-fidelity models of the dynamics of impacts in such material are needed to help with the interpretation of seismic signals that are now recorded by SEIS, the seismometer of InSight. We developed a numerical model for impacts on regolith, using the novel Hybrid Optimization Software Suite (HOSS), which is a Lagrangian code mixing finite and discrete element formulations. We use data from hypervelocity impact experiments performed on pumice sand at the NASA Ames Vertical Gun Range to identify and calibrate key model parameters. The model provides insight into the plastic-elastic transition observed in the data and it also demonstrates that gravity plays a key role in the material response. Waveforms for receivers situated vertically below the impact point are correctly modeled, while more research is needed to explain the shallow receivers' signals.

Here we present a very similar WACC pattern over the NA sector on both interannual and subseasonal time scales. Lead-lag regression analyses on the shorter time scale indicate that an anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Alaska/Yukon in conjunction with the downward surface turbulent heat flux and long-wave radiation anomalies over CBS leads the formation of the WACC pattern by about 1-2 days, while the latter further leads CBS sea ice reduction by about 3 days. These results indicate that atmospheric variability may play an active role in driving both the WACC pattern over NA and CBS sea ice variability.

Titan also harbors a subsurface water ocean, and its ice shell is likely capped by a thick crust of low-conductivity methane clathrates that are very stable under Titan's surface conditions. Here, we investigate the effect of this insulating clathrate crust on convection in the ice shell. Without the clathrate crust, convection occurs below a stagnant lid that is a few tens of kilometers thick and limits the exchange between the surface and the deep ocean. We show that a 5-10 km thick clathrate crust reduces the stagnant lid thickness about threefold thus increasing the potential for the ocean-surface exchange. Moreover, the insulating effect of clathrates dramatically decreases the amount of extracted heat thus limiting the freezing rate of Titan's ocean.

We present a new bathymetry of its sub-ice shelf cavity using a three-dimensional inversion of airborne gravity data constrained by multibeam bathymetry at sea and a reconstruction of the bedrock from mass conservation on land. The new bathymetry is deeper than previously estimated with differences exceeding 500 m in a number of regions. When incorporated into an ocean model, it yields a better description of the spatial distribution of ice shelf melt, specifically along glacier grounding lines. While the melt intensity is overestimated because of a positive bias in ocean thermal forcing, the study reveals the main pathways along which warm oceanic water enters the cavity and corroborates the observed rapid retreat of Berry Glacier along a deep channel with a retrograde bed slope.

In particular, this approach provides observation-constrained quantification of the dust's dry and wet deposition along its transport pathways and is validated against multiple satellite observations. The current large ensemble trajectory simulations identify favorable transport pathways from the El Djouf across the Atlantic Ocean with respect to seasonal rain belts. The limited potential for long-range transport of dust from the Bodele depression is attributed to the currently identified extensive near-source dust removal primarily by dry and wet deposition during boreal winter and summer, respectively.

Old growth Afrotropical forests critical for maintaining forest carbon	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						aboveground biomass; carbon; Central Africa; climate change; Gabon; large trees; tree height; tropical forest; wood density	ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; INCREASE; DENSITY; STOCKS; LAND; AREA	Aim Large trees [>= 70 cm diameter at breast height (DBH)] contribute disproportionately to aboveground carbon stock (AGC) across the tropics but may be vulnerable to changing climate and human activities. Here we determine the distribution, drivers and threats to large trees and high carbon forest. Location Central Africa. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Trees. Methods Using Gabon's new National Resource Inventory of 104 field sites, AGC was calculated from 67,466 trees from 578 species and 97 genera. Power and Michaelis-Menten models assessed the contribution of large trees to AGC. Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of AGC, large trees, and stand variables were modelled using Akaike's information criterion (AIC) weights to calculate average regression coefficients for all p ossible models. Results Mean AGC for trees >= 10 cm DBH in Gabonese forestlands was 141.7 Mg C/ha, with averages of 166.6, 171.3 and 96.6 Mg C/ha in old growth, concession and secondary forest. High carbon forests occurred where large trees are most abundant: 31% of AGC was stored in large trees (2.3% of all stems). Human activities largely drove variation in AGC and large trees, but climate and edaphic conditions also determined stand variables (basal area, tree height, wood density, stem density). AGC and large trees increased with distance from human settlements; AGC was 40% lower in secondary than primary and concession forests and 33% higher in protected than non-managed areas. Main conclusions AGC and large trees were negatively associated with human activities, highlighting the importance of forest management. Redefining large trees as >= 50 cm DBH (4.3% more stems) would account for 20% more AGC. This study demonstrates that protecting relatively undisturbed forests can be disproportionately effective in conserving carbon and suggests that including sustainable forestry in programs like reduced emissions for deforestation and forest degradation could maintain carbon dense forests in logging concessions that are a large proportion of remaining Central African forests.

Atmospheric emissions and concentrations of CH4 continue to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-influenced greenhouse gas in terms of climate forcing, after carbon dioxide (CO2). The relative importance of CH4 compared to CO2 depends on its shorter atmospheric lifetime, stronger warming potential, and variations in atmospheric growth rate over the past decade, the causes of which are still debated. Two major challenges in reducing uncertainties in the atmospheric growth rate arise from the variety of geographically overlapping CH4 sources and from the destruction of CH4 by short-lived hydroxyl radicals (OH). To address these challenges, we have established a consortium of multidisciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate new research aimed at improving and regularly updating the global methane budget. Following Saunois et al. (2016), we present here the second version of the living review paper dedicated to the decadal methane budget, integrating results of top-down studies (atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up estimates (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, inventories of anthropogenic emissions, and data-driven extrapolations). For the 2008-2017 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by atmospheric inversions (a top-down approach) to be 576 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (range 550-594, corresponding to the minimum and maximum estimates of the model ensemble). Of this total, 359 Tg CH4 yr(-1) or similar to 60 % is attributed to anthropogenic sources, that is emissions caused by direct human activity (i.e. anthropogenic emissions; range 336-376 Tg CH4 yr(-1) or 50 %-65 %). The mean annual total emission for the new decade (2008-2017) is 29 Tg CH4 yr(-1) larger than our estimate for the previous decade (2000-2009), and 24 Tg CH4 yr(-1) larger than the one reported in the previous budget for 2003-2012 (Saunois et al., 2016). Since 2012, global CH4 emissions have been tracking the warmest scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Bottom-up methods suggest almost 30 % larger global emissions (737 Tg CH4 yr(-1), range 594-881) than top-down inversion methods. Indeed, bottom-up estimates for natural sources such as natural wetlands, other inland water systems, and geological sources are higher than top-down estimates. The atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget suggest that at least some of these bottom-up emissions are overestimated. The latitudinal distribution of atmospheric observation-based emissions indicates a predominance of tropical emissions (similar to 65 % of the global budget, < 30 degrees N) compared to mid-latitudes (similar to 30 %, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern latitudes (similar to 4 %, 60-90 degrees N). The most important source of uncertainty in the methane budget is attributable to natural emissions, especially those from wetlands and other inland waters. Some of our global source estimates are smaller than those in previously published budgets (Saunois et al., 2016; Kirschke et al., 2013). In particular wetland emissions are about 35 Tg CH4 yr(-1) lower due to improved partition wetlands and other inland waters. Emissions from geological sources and wild animals are also found to be smaller by 7 Tg CH4 yr(-1) by 8 Tg CH4 yr(-1), respectively. However, the overall discrepancy between bottomup and top-down estimates has been reduced by only 5 % compared to Saunois et al. (2016), due to a higher estimate of emissions from inland waters, highlighting the need for more detailed research on emissions factors. Priorities for improving the methane budget include (i) a global, high-resolution map of water-saturated soils and inundated areas emitting methane based on a robust classification of different types of emitting habitats; (ii) further development of process-based models for inland-water emissions; (iii) intensification of methane observations at local scales (e.g., FLUXNET-CH4 measurements) and urban-scale monitoring to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scales (surface networks and satellites) to constrain atmospheric inversions; (iv) improvements of transport models and the representation of photochemical sinks in top-down inversions; and (v) development of a 3D variational inversion system using isotopic and/or co-emitted species such as ethane to improve source partitioning.

Here we present a decade-plus analysis that integrates, for the first time, time series of satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation and satellite thermal infrared edifice-scale surface warming at a large silicic system: Domuyo volcano, in Argentina. We find that deformation and warming are highly correlated, and depending on the sign and lag between the time series, either shallow sealing or magma influx could drive Domuyo's ongoing inflation (similar to 0.15 m/year; from an InSAR-derived tabular source, similar to 11x8x1 km; similar to 6.5 km depth; similar to 0.037 km(3)/year volume-change rate) and warming (0.3-0.4 degrees C/year). This study shows the potential that combined satellite surface deformation and edifice-scale surface warming time series have on assessing the physical mechanisms of silicic volcanic systems and for constraining deterministic models.

The structure of Titan's atmosphere from Cassini radio occultations: One-and two-way occultations	ICARUS			English	Article						Titan; Atmospheres; Structure; Occultations		We present the results of the remaining ten soundings of Titan's atmosphere by radio occultations using the Cassini spacecraft that have not been previously reported. Three were in 2008 and 2009, and used the Ultra Stable Oscillator onboard the spacecraft. The rest were in 2014 and 2016 after the USO had failed and were executed in two-way mode. Comparison of the later soundings with those earlier in the Cassini mission provide an indication of the seasonal change at mid latitudes. The southern hemisphere has shown a dramatic cooling during the onset of autumn; change in the northern hemisphere is noticeable, but more subdued. Changes at low latitudes are even smaller. The additional retrievals from 2008 to 2009 add a better constraint on the latitude structure of the previously reported destabilization of the temperature profiles at northern latitudes during winter and early spring. They show that the most pronounced effect is at polar latitudes (>70 N), suggesting that they are associated with the descending circulation over the winter pole that has been proposed by several authors. The full set of occultations indicates minimal variation with latitude and time in the troposphere, likely attributable to the large atmospheric radiative damping time and efficient meridional heat transports, but somewhat more variation near the surface, which has a smaller thermal inertia.

Spatial structure in Neptune's 7.90-mu m stratospheric CH4 emission, as measured by VLT-VISIR	ICARUS			English	Article						Atmospheres, dynamics; Atmospheres, chemistry; Infrared observations; Neptune, atmosphere; Abundances, atmospheres	GROUND-BASED OBSERVATIONS; CLOUD STRUCTURE; SPACE-TELESCOPE; RESOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; URANUS; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; CIRCULATION	We present a comparison of VLT-VISIR images and Keck-NIRC2 images of Neptune, which highlight the coupling between its troposphere and stratosphere. VLT-VISIR images were obtained on September 16th 2008 (UT) at 7.90 mu m and 12.27 mu m, which are primarily sensitive to 1-mbar CH4 and C2H6 emission, respectively. NIRC2 images in the H band were obtained on October 5th, 6th and 9th 2008 (UT) and sense clouds and haze in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (from approximately 600 to 20 mbar). At 7.90 mu m, we observe enhancements of CH4 emission in latitude bands centered at approximately 25 degrees S and 48 degrees S (planetocentric). Within these zonal bands, tentative detections (< 2 sigma) of discrete hotspots of CH4 emission are also evident at 24 degrees S, 181 degrees W and 42 degrees S, 170 degrees W. The longitudinal-mean enhancements in the CH4 emission are also latitudinallycoincident with bands of bright (presumably CH4 ice) clouds in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere evidenced in the H-band images. This suggests the Neptunian troposphere and stratosphere are coupled in these specific regions. This could be in the form of (1) 'overshoot' of strong, upwelling plumes and advection of CH4 ice into the lower stratosphere, which subsequently sublimates into CH4 gas and/or (2) generation of waves by plumes impinging from the tropopause below, which impart their energy and heat the lower stratosphere. We favor the former process since there is no evidence of similar smaller-scale morphology in the C2H6 emission, which probes a similar atmospheric level. However, we cannot exclude temperature variations as the source of the morphology observed in CH4 emission. Future, near-infrared imaging of Neptune performed near-simultaneously with future mid-infrared spectral observations of Neptune by the James Webb Space Telescope would allow the coupling of Neptune's troposphere and stratosphere to be confirmed and studied in greater detail.

The time period from 10 January to 20 February 2017, when an international radar network observation campaign was performed, is focused on. The model resolution is T42L124, which can resolve phenomena at synoptic and larger scales. A conventional observation dataset provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, PREPBUFR, and satellite temperature data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) for the stratosphere and mesosphere are assimilated. First, the performance of the forecast model is improved by modifying the vertical profile of the horizontal diffusion coefficient and modifying the source intensity in the non-orographic gravity wave parameterization by comparing it with radar wind observations in the mesosphere. Second, the MLS observational bias is estimated as a function of the month and latitude and removed before the data assimilation. Third, data assimilation parameters, such as the degree of gross error check, localization length, inflation factor, and assimilation window, are optimized based on a series of sensitivity tests. The effect of increasing the ensemble member size is also examined. The obtained global data are evaluated by comparison with the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data covering pressure levels up to 0.1 hPa and by the radar mesospheric observations, which are not assimilated.

Optimization of Laser Stabilization via Self-Injection Locking to a Whispering-Gallery-Mode Microresonator	PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED			English	Article							NARROW-LINEWIDTH; FREQUENCY STABILIZATION; SEMICONDUCTOR-LASERS; OPTICAL FEEDBACK; DIODE-LASER; EXTERNAL-CAVITY; NOISE-REDUCTION; PHASE NOISE; RESONATORS; SCATTERING	Self-injection locking is a dynamic phenomenon representing stabilization of the emission frequency of an oscillator with a passive cavity enabling frequency-filtered coherent feedback to the oscillator cavity. For instance, self-injection locking of a semiconductor laser to a high-quality-factor (high-Q) whispering-gallery-mode microresonator can result in reduction of the laser linewidth by multiple orders of magnitude. The phenomenon was broadly studied in experiments, but there was no detailed theoretical model allowing improvement of the stabilization performance. In this paper we develop such a theory. We introduce five parameters identifying the efficiency of the self-injection locking in an experiment, comprising backscat-tering efficiency, phase delay between the laser and the high-Q cavities, frequency detuning between the laser and the high-Q cavities, the pump coupling efficiency, and the optical path length between the laser and the microresonator. Our calculations show that the laser linewidth can be reduced by 2 orders of magnitude compared with the case of nonoptimal self-injection locking. We present recommen-dations for experimental realization of the optimal self-injection-locking regime. The theoretical model provides deeper understanding of self-injection locking and benefits multiple practical applications of self-injection-locked oscillators.

This model intercomparison focuses on the very stable stratification encountered over the Antarctic Plateau in 2009. Here, we analyze results from 10 large-eddy-simulation (LES) codes for different spatial resolutions over 24 consecutive hours, and compare them with observations acquired at the Concordia Research Station during summer. This is a challenging exercise for such simulations since they need to reproduce both the 300-m-deep convective boundary layer and the very thin stable boundary layer characterized by a strong vertical temperature gradient (10 K difference over the lowest 20 m) when the sun is low over the horizon. A large variability in surface fluxes among the different models is highlighted. The LES models correctly reproduce the convective boundary layer in terms of mean profiles and turbulent characteristics but display more spread during stable conditions, which is largely reduced by increasing the horizontal and vertical resolutions in additional simulations focusing only on the stable period. This highlights the fact that very fine resolution is needed to represent such conditions. Complementary sensitivity studies are conducted regarding the roughness length, the subgrid-scale turbulence closure as well as the resolution and domain size. While we find little dependence on the surface-flux parametrization, the results indicate a pronounced sensitivity to both the roughness length and the turbulence closure.

J	Turyshev, SG; Toth, VT				Turyshev, Slava G.; Toth, Viktor T.			Image formation for extended sources with the solar gravitational lens	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC DIFFRACTION; OPTICAL SYSTEMS	We study the image formation process with the solar gravitational lens (SGL) in the case of an extended, resolved source. An imaging telescope, modeled as a convex lens, is positioned within the image cylinder formed by the light received from the source. In the strong interference region of the SGL, this light is greatly amplified, forming the Einstein ring around the Sun, representing a distorted image of the extended source. We study the intensity distribution within the Einstein ring observed in the focal plane of the convex lens. For any particular telescope position in the image plane, we model light received from the resolved source as a combination of two signals: light received from the directly imaged region of the source and light from the rest of the source. We also consider the case when the telescope points away from the extended source or, equivalently, it observes light from sources in sky positions that are some distance away from the extended source but still in its proximity. At even larger distances from the optical axis, in the weak interference or geometric optics regions, our approach recovers known models related to micro-lensing but now obtained via the wave-optical treatment. We then derive the power of the signal and related photon fluxes within the annulus that contains the Einstein ring of the extended source, as seen by the imaging telescope. We discuss the properties of the deconvolution process, especially its effects on noise in the recovered image. We compare anticipated signals from realistic exoplanetary targets against estimates of noise from the solar corona and estimate integration times needed for the recovery of high-quality images of faint sources. The results demonstrate that the SGL offers a unique, realistic capability to obtain resolved images of exoplanets in our Galactic neighborhood.

This is in part due to the unrealistic assumption that total plant carbon expenditure (PCE) is always equal to gross carbon accumulation by photosynthesis. We present and evaluate a simple model of labile carbon storage and utilisation (SUGAR) designed to be integrated into an LSM, which allows simulated plant respiration and growth to vary independent of photosynthesis. SUGAR buffers simulated PCE against seasonal variation in photosynthesis, producing more constant (less variable) predictions of plant growth and respiration relative to an LSM that does not represent labile carbon storage. This allows the model to more accurately capture observed carbon fluxes at a large-scale drought experiment in a tropical moist forest in the Amazon, relative to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator LSM (JULES). SUGAR is designed to improve the representation of carbon storage in LSMs and provides a simple framework that allows new processes to be integrated as the empirical understanding of carbon storage in plants improves. The study highlights the need for future research into carbon storage and allocation in plants, particularly in response to extreme climate events such as drought.

HDO and SO2 thermal mapping on Venus: V. Evidence for a long-term anti-correlation	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: terrestrial planets; infrared: planetary systems	MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; SULFUR-DIOXIDE; WATER-VAPOR; CHEMISTRY	Since January 2012, we have been monitoring the behavior of sulfur dioxide and water on Venus, using the Texas Echelon Cross-Echelle Spectrograph imaging spectrometer at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF, Mauna Kea Observatory). Here, we present new data recorded in February and April 2019 in the 1345 cm(-1) (7.4 mu m) spectral range, where SO2, CO2, and HDO (used as a proxy for H2O) transitions were observed. The cloud top of Venus was probed at an altitude of about 64 km. As in our previous studies, the volume mixing ratio (vmr) of SO2 was estimated using the SO2/CO2 line depth ratio of weak transitions; the H2O volume mixing ratio was derived from the HDO/CO2 line depth ratio, assuming a D/H ratio of 200 times the Vienna standard mean ocean water. As reported in our previous analyses, the SO2 mixing ratio shows strong variations with time and also over the disk, showing evidence for the formation of SO2 plumes with a lifetime of a few hours; in contrast, the H2O abundance is remarkably uniform over the disk and shows moderate variations as a function of time. We have used the 2019 data in addition to our previous dataset to study the long-term variations of SO2 and H2O. The data reveal a long-term anti-correlation with a correlation coefficient of -0.80; this coefficient becomes -0.90 if the analysis is restricted to the 2014-2019 time period. The statistical analysis of the SO2 plumes as a function of local time confirms our previous result with a minimum around 10:00 and two maxima near the terminators. The dependence of the SO2 vmr with respect to local time shows a higher abundance at the evening terminator with respect to the morning. The dependence of the SO2 vmr with respect to longitude exhibits a broad maximum at 120-200 degrees east longitudes, near the region of Aphrodite Terra. However, this trend has not been observed by other measurements and has yet to be confirmed.

The International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean Version 4.0	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article; Data Paper							RESOLUTION AIRBORNE GRAVITY; ICE-SHEET FLOW; WEST GREENLAND; SUBMARINE LANDFORMS; MELTING GREENLAND; LOMONOSOV RIDGE; SEA-ICE; GLACIERS; TROUGH; SHELF	Bathymetry (seafloor depth), is a critical parameter providing the geospatial context for a multitude of marine scientific studies. Since 1997, the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) has been the authoritative source of bathymetry for the Arctic Ocean. IBCAO has merged its efforts with the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO-Seabed 2030 Project, with the goal of mapping all of the oceans by 2030. Here we present the latest version (IBCAO Ver. 4.0), with more than twice the resolution (200 x 200m versus 500 x 500m) and with individual depth soundings constraining three times more area of the Arctic Ocean (similar to 19.8% versus 6.7%), than the previous IBCAO Ver. 3.0 released in 2012. Modern multibeam bathymetry comprises similar to 14.3% in Ver. 4.0 compared to similar to 5.4% in Ver. 3.0. Thus, the new IBCAO Ver. 4.0 has substantially more seafloor morphological information that offers new insights into a range of submarine features and processes; for example, the improved portrayal of Greenland fjords better serves predictive modelling of the fate of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Forecasts, constraints and measurement bounds can now too perhaps be estimated from accurate numerical simulations of the fifth force and its Laplacian field at solar system scales. The cubic Galileon gravity scalar field model (CGG), which arises in various massive gravity models including the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld model, describes modified gravity incorporating a Vainshtein screening mechanism. The nonlinear derivative interactions in the CGG equation suppress the field near regions of high density, thereby restoring general relativity (GR) while far from such regions, field enhancement is comparable to GR and the equation is dominated by a linear term. This feature of the governing equation poses some numerical challenges for computation of the scalar potential, force and Laplacian fields even under stationary conditions. Here we present a numerical method based on finite differences for solution of the static CGG scalar field for a 2D axisymmetric Sun-Earth system and a 3D Cartesian Sun-Earth-Moon system. The method relies on gradient descent of an integrated residual based on the normal attractive branch of the CGG equation. The algorithm is shown to be stable, accurate and rapidly convergent toward the global minimum state. We hope this numerical study, which can easily be extended to include smaller bodies such as detection satellites, will prove useful to future measurement of modified gravity force fields at solar system scales.

Framework for assessing land-management effects on at-risk species: Example of SE USA wood pellet production and gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Early Access						biodiversity; bioenergy; forest management; keystone species; renewable fuel; sustainability	RESPIRATORY-TRACT DISEASE; BIODIVERSITY OFFSETS; BIOENERGY PRODUCTION; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; BIOMASS; DEBRIS; CONSERVATION; ECOLOGY; POLICY; CONSEQUENCES	Land-management choices made for economic and societal gains intrinsically influence landscapes and species that are dependent upon them. We propose a simple analysis framework to examine critical intersections between land-management choices and the life-history conditions of selected species of concern, thereby facilitating the identification of mitigation practices that can reduce negative impacts on species at risk. We test the proposed framework through application to gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a keystone species that is the focus of conservation efforts across the southeastern region of United States of America, where wood pellets are being produced for bioenergy. Production of these wood pellets for export to Europe and Asia has drastically increased in the past decade, raising concerns about potential harm to biodiversity since many species in the forests sourcing pellet production were already at risk prior to the development of this new commodity. Identifying the mechanisms of potential impacts of wood pellet production on species of concern is essential to establishing meaningful management recommendations that can enhance conservation efforts while supporting sustainable bioenergy. By considering the intersections between life-history conditions of gopher tortoise and forest-management practices related to woody biomass extraction for pellet production, we identify several mechanisms by which the wood-pellet industry might affect this species of concern, both positively and negatively. We then identify mitigation practices that can help offset the potential impacts of logging, thinning, and dead wood removal on gopher tortoise. Our analysis framework may be transferable to other species of concern and land-management practices across diverse landscapes.

Simultaneous observations of the blazar PKS 2155-304 from ultra-violet to TeV energies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 2155-304; astroparticle physics	SYNCHROTRON-RADIATION; GAMMA-RAYS; VARIABILITY; PKS-2155-304; FERMI; HESS; TELESCOPE; OBJECTS; SYSTEM	Here we report the results of the first ever contemporaneous multi-wavelength observation campaign on the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304 involving Swift, NuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, and H.E.S.S. The use of these instruments allows us to cover a broad energy range, which is important for disentangling the different radiative mechanisms. The source, observed from June 2013 to October 2013, was found in a low flux state with respect to previous observations but exhibited highly significant flux variability in the X-rays. The high-energy end of the synchrotron spectrum can be traced up to 40 keV without significant contamination by high-energy emission. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was used to reproduce the broadband flux of the source for all the observations presented here but failed for previous observations made in April 2013. A lepto-hadronic solution was then explored to explain these earlier observational results.

We develop global estimates of annual PM2.5 concentrations and trends for 1998-2018 using advances in satellite observations, chemical transport modeling, and ground-based monitoring. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) from advanced satellite products including finer resolution, increased global coverage, and improved long-term stability are combined and related to surface PM2.5 concentrations using geophysical relationships between surface PM2.5 and AOD simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with updated algorithms. The resultant annual mean geophysical PM2.5 estimates are highly consistent with globally distributed ground monitors (R-2 = 0.81; slope = 0.90). Geographically weighted regression is applied to the geophysical PM2.5 estimates to predict and account for the residual bias with PM2.5 monitors, yielding even higher cross validated agreement (R-2 = 0.90-0.92; slope = 0.90-0.97) with ground monitors and improved agreement compared to all earlier global estimates. The consistent long-term satellite AOD and simulation enable trend assessment over a 21 year period, identifying significant trends for eastern North America (-0.28 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3)/yr), Europe (-0.15 +/- 0.03 mu g/m(3)/yr), India (1.13 +/- 0.15 mu g/m(3)/yr), and globally (0.04 +/- 0.02 mu g/m(3)/yr). The positive trend (2.44 +/- 0.44 mu g/m(3)/yr) for India over 2005-2013 and the negative trend (-3.37 +/- 0.38 mu g/m(3)/yr) for China over 2011-2018 are remarkable, with implications for the health of billions of people.

To this end, Obs4MIPs (1) targets observed variables that can be compared to CMIP model variables; (2) utilizes dataset formatting specifications and metadata requirements closely aligned with CMIP model output; (3) provides brief technical documentation for each dataset, designed for nonexperts and tailored towards relevance for model evaluation, including information on uncertainty, dataset merits, and limitations; and (4) disseminates the data through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) platforms, making the observations searchable and acces- sible via the same portals as the model output. Taken together, these characteristics of the organization and structure of obs4MIPs should entice a more diverse community of researchers to engage in the comparison of model output with observations and to contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the climate models. At present, the number of obs4MIPs datasets has grown to about 80; many are undergoing updates, with another 20 or so in preparation, and more than 100 are proposed and under consideration. A partial list of current global satellite-based datasets includes humidity and temperature profiles; a wide range of cloud and aerosol observations; ocean surface wind, temperature, height, and sea ice fraction; surface and top-of-atmosphere longwave and shortwave radiation; and ozone (O-3), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide CO2) products. A partial list of proposed products expected to be useful in analyzing CMIP6 results includes the following: alternative products for the above quantities, additional products for ocean surface flux and chlorophyll products, a number of vegetation products (e.g., FAPAR, LAI, burned area fraction), ice sheet mass and height, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). While most existing obs4MIPs datasets consist of monthly-mean gridded data over the global domain, products with higher time resolution (e.g., daily) and/or regional products are now receiving more attention. Along with an increasing number of datasets, obs4MIPs has implemented a number of capability upgrades including (1) an updated obs4MIPs data specifications document that provides additional search facets and generally improves congruence with CMIP6 specifications for model datasets, (2) a set of six easily understood indicators that help guide users as to a dataset's maturity and suitability for application, and (3) an option to supply supplemental information about a dataset beyond what can be found in the standard metadata. With the maturation of the obs4MIPs framework, the dataset inclusion process, and the dataset formatting guidelines and resources, the scope of the observations being considered is expected to grow to include gridded in situ datasets as well as datasets with a regional focus, and the ultimate intent is to judiciously expand this scope to any observation dataset that has applicability for evaluation of the types of Earth system models used in CMIP.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Results: Cosmological constraints from cluster abundances and weak lensing	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							HALO MASS FUNCTION; GALAXY FORMATION; ASSEMBLY BIAS; CALIBRATION; REDMAPPER; SDSS; IMPACT; SAMPLE; MODEL; PARAMETERS	We perform a joint analysis of the counts and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 dataset. Our analysis uses the same shear and source photometric redshifts estimates as were used in the DES combined probes analysis. Our analysis results in surprisingly low values for S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) = 0.65 0.04, driven by a low matter density parameter, Omega(m) = 0.179(-0.038)(+0.031), with sigma(8) - Omega(m) posteriors in 2.4 sigma tension with the DES Y1 3x2pt results, and in 5.6 sigma with the Planck CMB analysis. These results include the impact of post-unblinding changes to the analysis, which did not improve the level of consistency with other data sets compared to the results obtained at the unblinding. The fact that multiple cosmological probes (supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and CMB anisotropies), and other galaxy cluster analyses all favor significantly higher matter densities suggests the presence of systematic errors in the data or an incomplete modeling of the relevant physics. Cross checks with x-ray and microwave data, as well as independent constraints on the observable -mass relation from Sunyaev-Zeldovich selected clusters, suggest that the discrepancy resides in our modeling of the weak lensing signal rather than the cluster abundance. Repeating our analysis using a higher richness threshold (lambda >= 30) significantly reduces the tension with other probes, and points to one or more richness -dependent effects not captured by our model.

J	Santos, MSF; Noell, AC; Mora, MF				Santos, Mauro Sergio Ferreira; Noell, Aaron Craig; Mora, Maria Fernanda			Methods for onboard monitoring of silver biocide during future human space exploration missions	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							CONTACTLESS CONDUCTIVITY DETECTION; MICROCHIP ELECTROPHORESIS; CAPILLARY; SEPARATION	Silver ions (Ag+) have been proposed as a biocide to treat the water in NASA's next generation of human space exploration vehicles/habitats. One advantage of Ag+ is that it is effective as a biocide in a range (200 to 500 ppb) safe for human consumption. So, monitoring Ag+ is essential to ensure the safety and health of the crew. Here we present two analytical methods based on capillary electrophoresis and capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-(CD)-D-4) to address the need to monitor Ag+ levels in water. Using 5 M acetic acid as a background electrolyte (BGE), 100 ppb of Ag+ could be detected in a simulant of the International Space Station (ISS) water. In addition to Ag+, other inorganic cations (K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) frequently found in the ISS potable water can be detected simultaneously using this BGE in less than 4.5 min. By using a BGE composed of 0.5 M acetic acid, levels of Ag+ as low as 25 ppb could be detected in the ISS water simulant in less than 2.5 min. Although in this condition none of the other cations interfered with the detection of Ag+, some of them co-migrated, which could prevent obtaining additional information about the sample composition.

To illustrate the applicability of the system, an extended Dicke model is developed for atoms undergoing Raman transitions between the ground states in the presence of laser fields and considering dipole-dipole interactions; the latter has been neglected in many previous works. We have studied the effect of a ferroelectric and an antiferroelectric arrangement on the phase transition for both a finite and an infinite number of dipoles. An additional superradiant phase is observed in the deep-strong-coupling regime due to influence of the dipole-dipole interaction term. A high degree of dipole-dipole entanglement occurs for the antiferroelectric arrangement in the deep-strong regime, whereas it gets disentangled quite rapidly for the ferroelectric arrangement. A sharp transition of system parameters is observed in the ultrastrong-coupling regime and beyond. The dipole-dipole interaction also influences the spectra of the system, inducing a significant shift in the peaks, and modifies the average number of photons emitted.

J	Lee, JH; Wagstaff, KL				Lee, Jake H.; Wagstaff, Kiri L.			Visualizing image content to explain novel image discovery	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article; Early Access						Novelty detection; Explanations; Image analysis	FEATURES; SCALE	The initial analysis of any large data set can be divided into two phases: (1) the identification of common trends or patterns and (2) the identification of anomalies or outliers that deviate from those trends. We focus on the goal of detecting observations with novel content, which can alert us to artifacts in the data set or, potentially, the discovery of previously unknown phenomena. To aid in interpreting and diagnosing the novel aspect of these selected observations, we recommend the use of novelty detection methods that generate explanations. In the context of large image data sets, these explanations should highlight what aspect of a given image is new (color, shape, texture, content) in a human-comprehensible form. We propose DEMUD-VIS, the first method for providing visual explanations of novel image content by employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features, a method that uses reconstruction error to detect novel content, and an up-convolutional network to convert CNN feature representations back into image space. We demonstrate this approach on diverse images from ImageNet, freshwater streams, and the surface of Mars. Finally, we evaluate the utility of the visual explanations with a user study.

Tropical tree size-frequency distributions from airborne lidar	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						airborne lidar; crown area; individual tree crown; plot-level aboveground biomass; size-classes-level basal area; tree diameter; tree height; tree size frequency	GENERAL QUANTITATIVE THEORY; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; FOREST STRUCTURE; METABOLIC ECOLOGY; CARBON STOCKS; ADULT STATURE; HEIGHT; ALLOMETRY; DENSITY; REGENERATION	In tropical rainforests, tree size and number density are influenced by disturbance history, soil, topography, climate, and biological factors that are difficult to predict without detailed and widespread forest inventory data. Here, we quantify tree size-frequency distributions over an old-growth wet tropical forest at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica by using an individual tree crown (ITC) algorithm on airborne lidar measurements. The ITC provided tree height, crown area, the number of trees >10 m height and, predicted tree diameter, and aboveground biomass from field allometry. The number density showed strong agreement with field observations at the plot- (97.4%; 3% bias) and tree-height-classes level (97.4%; 3% bias). The lidar trees size spectra of tree diameter and height closely follow the distributions measured on the ground but showed less agreement with crown area observations. The model to convert lidar-derived tree height and crown area to tree diameter produced unbiased (0.8%) estimates of plot-level basal area and with low uncertainty (6%). Predictions on basal area for tree height classes were also unbiased (1.3%) but with larger uncertainties (22%). The biomass estimates had no significant bias at the plot- and tree-height-classes level (-5.2% and 2.1%). Our ITC method provides a powerful tool for tree- to landscape-level tropical forest inventory and biomass estimation by overcoming the limitations of lidar area-based approaches that require local calibration using a large number of inventory plots.

The surveys cover approximately 500 x 500 m areas just south of Highway 178 with an average ground sample distance of 1.5 cm. The first survey took place five days after the M-w 6.4 foreshock on 9 July 2019. The final survey took place on 27 September 2019. The time between surveys increased over time, with the first five surveys taking place in the first month after the earthquake. Comparison of imagery from before and after the M-w 7.1 earthquake shows variation in slip on the main rupture and a small amount of distributed slip across the scene. Cracks can be observed and mapped in the high-resolution imagery, which show en echelon cracking, fault splays, and a northeast-striking conjugate fault at the M-w 7.1 rupture south of Highway 178 and near the dirt road. Initial postseismic results show little fault afterslip, but possible subsidence in the first 7-10 days after the earthquake, followed by uplift.

Ongoing flyby in the young multiple system UX Tauri	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						protoplanetary disks; circumstellar matter; stars: pre-main sequence; binaries: general	SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; PROTOPLANETARY DISCS; DIVERSITY	We present observations of the young multiple system UX Tauri to look for circumstellar disks and for signs of dynamical interactions. We obtained SPHERE/IRDIS deep differential polarization images in the J and H bands. We also used ALMA archival CO data. Large extended spirals are well detected in scattered light coming out of the disk of UX Tau A. The southern spiral forms a bridge between UX Tau A and C. These spirals, including the bridge connecting the two stars, all have a CO (3-2) counterpart seen by ALMA. The disk of UX Tau C is detected in scattered light. It is much smaller than the disk of UX Tau A and has a major axis along a different position angle, suggesting a misalignment. We performed PHANTOM SPH hydrodynamical models to interpret the data. The scattered light spirals, CO emission spirals and velocity patterns of the rotating disks, and the compactness of the disk of UX Tau C all point to a scenario in which UX Tau A has been perturbed very recently (similar to 1000 years) by the close passage of UX Tau C.

DES Collaboration	OzDES multi-object fibre spectroscopy for the Dark Energy Survey: results and second data release	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						transients: supernovae; quasars: supermassive black holes; cosmology: dark energy; surveys; catalogues; techniques: spectroscopic	LEGACY SURVEY; SUPERNOVAE	We present a description of the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES) and summarize the results from its 6 years of operations. Using the 2dF fibre positioner and AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope, OzDES has monitored 771 active galactic nuclei, classified hundreds of supernovae, and obtained redshifts for thousands of galaxies that hosted a transient within the 10 deep fields of the Dark Energy Survey. We also present the second OzDES data release, containing the redshifts of almost 30 000 sources, some as faint as r(AB) = 24 mag, and 375 000 individual spectra. These data, in combination with the time-series photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, will be used to measure the expansion history of the Universe out to z similar to 1.2 and the masses of hundreds of black holes out to z similar to 4. OzDES is a template for future surveys that combine simultaneous monitoring of targets with wide-field imaging cameras and wide-field multi-object spectrographs.	[Lidman, C.; Tucker, B.

DES Collaboration	DES16C3cje: A low-luminosity, long-lived supernova	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general; supernovae: individual: (DES16C3cje)	TIDAL DISRUPTION; PAIR-INSTABILITY; STAR-FORMATION; LIGHT CURVES; LATE TIMES; SN 2005CS; EVOLUTION; FALLBACK; TRANSIENTS; PHOTOMETRY	We present DES16C3cje, a low-luminosity, long-lived type II supernova (SN II) at redshift 0.0618, detected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). DES16C3cje is a unique SN. The spectra are characterized by extremely narrow photospheric lines corresponding to very low expansion velocities of less than or similar to 1500 km s(-1), and the light curve shows an initial peak that fades after 50 d before slowly rebrightening over a further 100 d to reach an absolute brightness of M-r similar to 15.5 mag. The decline rate of the late-time light curve is then slower than that expected from the powering by radioactive decay of Co-56, but is comparable to that expected from accretion power. Comparing the bolometric light curve with hydrodynamical models, we find that DES16C3cje can be explained by either (i) a low explosion energy (0.11 foe) and relatively large Ni-56 production of 0.075 M-circle dot from an similar to 15 M-circle dot red supergiant progenitor typical of other SNe II, or (ii) a relatively compact similar to 40 M-circle dot star, explosion energy of 1 foe, and 0.08 M-circle dot of Ni-56. Both scenarios require additional energy input to explain the late-time light curve, which is consistent with fallback accretion at a rate of similar to 0.5 x 10(-)(8) M-circle dot s(-1).

The paucity of in situ salinity measurements in the Arctic Ocean has limited our ability to study Arctic-Ocean freshwater variability. Although satellite-derived sea surface height (SSH) and ocean bottom pressure (OBP) have been used together to infer depth-integrated freshwater content changes, these measurements are limited in sampling and resolution. Motivated by the recent development of sea surface salinity (SSS) remote sensing, we explore the use of SSS as a proxy for Arctic freshwater changes. As a first step, here we conduct a proof-of-concept study by analyzing the output of an ocean-ice state estimation product. We find that SSS variations are coherent with those of SSH-minus-OBP across the Arctic basin (with R similar to -0.8) except for those in the center of the Beaufort Gyre and the region affected by the subpolar North Atlantic inflow. On Arctic shelves, the linear regression coefficient between SSS and SSH-minus-OBP is -0.3 pss/cm or larger in magnitude. The results suggest that SSS is a good proxy for Arctic freshwater changes, and satellite SSH-minus-OBP can be used to evaluate satellite SSS quality.

Rising Trends in Heatwave Metrics Across Southern California	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						heatwave; severity; California; trends; temperature; urbanization	ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; HUMAN HEALTH; WAVE EVENTS; SHADE TREES; ENERGY USE; MORTALITY; IMPACTS; TEMPERATURE; DROUGHT; RISK	Research on heatwaves has gained significant impetus over the past decade due to a warming planet and rapid 21st century urbanization. This study examines driving factors influencing heatwave trends and interannual variability across Southern California (SoCal) from 1950-2020. Inland urban areas of Los Angeles county are the most susceptible to heatwaves with strong increasing trends in frequency, duration, and intensity that are closely tied to nighttime warming. Coastal and rural areas are less impacted but show a significant increase in heatwave frequency over the past two decades. Heatwave nighttime temperatures combined with high humidity have been increasing at a rapid rate of similar to 1 degrees C/decade since the 1980s-elevating heat stress and mortality risk to vulnerable urban communities. The increased nighttime humidity is associated with an anomalous moisture source off the coast of Baja California that has intensified over the past decade and is linked to ocean warming trends and changes in the California current system. Heatwaves are starting earlier and ending later in the year for urban regions. This augments public health risks and sets the stage for more intense fall wildfires by enhancing the drying of fuels. Droughts and heatwaves are strongly linked, particularly in inland urban and rural areas that have a high statistical probability of heatwaves increasing in frequency (42%), duration (26%), and daily mean temperature (2.2%) during severe drought conditions. Better understanding of heatwave climate drivers and underlying physical processes could help with prediction skill, in addition to providing effective data-driven recommendations for mitigation efforts in SoCal's vulnerable urban regions.

Break detection and outlier removal have been automated so that decades of daily measurements from thousands of stations can be processed in a few hours. New measurements are added, and parameters are updated every week. Model parameters allow separation of interseismic, annual, coseismic, and postseismic signals. Tools available through GeoGateway (http://geo-gateway.org) allow rapid visualization and analysis of these terms for results that can be subsetted in time or space. Results show highly variable and nonlinear motion for GPS stations in southern California. The variable motion is related to seasonal motions, distributed tectonic motion, earthquakes, and postseismic motions that can continue for years. In some areas results suggest that additional processes are responsible for the observed motions. In general, following earthquakes, stations return to their long-term motions after 2-3 years, though some exceptions occur. The use of the tools shows nonlinear motion in the Salton Trough of southern California related to the 2010 M7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, 2012 Brawley earthquake swarm, and a creep event on the Superstition Hills fault in 2017.

Many retrieval methods have been developed to estimate top-of-canopy SIF using ground-based spectroscopy. However, inconsistencies among methods may confound interpretation of SIF dynamics, eco-physiological/environmental drivers, and its relationship with photosynthesis. Using high temporal- and spectral resolution ground-based spectroscopy, we aimed to (1) evaluate performance of SIF retrieval methods under diverse sky conditions using continuous field measurements; (2) assess method sensitivity to fluctuating light, reflectance, and fluorescence emission spectra; and (3) inform users for optimal ground-based SIF retrieval. Analysis included field measurements from bi-hemispherical and hemispherical-conical systems and synthetic upwelling radiance constructed from measured downwelling radiance, simulated reflectance, and simulated fluorescence for benchmarking. Fraunhofer-based differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) and singular vector decomposition (SVD) retrievals exhibit convergent SIF-PAR relationships and diurnal consistency across different sky conditions, while O(2)A-based spectral fitting method (SFM), SVD, and modified Fraunhofer line discrimination (3FLD) exhibit divergent SIF-PAR relationships across sky conditions. Such behavior holds across system configurations, though hemispherical-conical systems diverge less across sky conditions. O(2)A retrieval accuracy, influenced by atmospheric distortion, improves with a narrower fitting window and when training SVD with temporally local spectra. This may impact SIF-photosynthesis relationships interpreted by previous studies using O(2)A-based retrievals with standard (759-767.76 nm) fitting windows. Fraunhofer-based retrievals resist atmospheric impacts but are noisier and more sensitive to assumed SIF spectral shape than O(2)A-based retrievals. We recommend SVD or SFM using reduced fitting window (759.5-761.5 nm) for robust far-red SIF retrievals across sky conditions.

Dynamical analysis of these systems imposes important constraints on formation mechanisms of these wide-orbit companions. As part of the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey we report the detection of a second planetary-mass companion around the 17 Myr-old, solar-type star TYC 8998-760-1 that is located in the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. The companion has a projected physical separation of 320 au and several individual photometric measurements from 1.1 to 3.8 microns constrain a companion mass of 6 1M(Jup), which is equivalent to a mass ratio ofq = 0.57 0.10% with respect to the primary. With the previously detected 14 3M(Jup)companion that is orbiting the primary at 160 au, TYC 8998-760-1 is the first directly imaged multiplanet system that is detected around a young, solar analog. We show that circular orbits are stable, but that mildly eccentric orbits for either/both components (e > 0.1) are chaotic on gigayear timescales, implying in situ formation or a very specific ejection by an unseen third companion. Due to the wide separations of the companions TYC 8998-760-1 is an excellent system for spectroscopic and photometric follow-up with space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope.

We applied several point-spread function (PSF) subtraction techniques to the observations (Mask-and-Interpolate, RDI-NMF, RDI-KLIP, and ADI-KLIP) to measure the geometric parameters and the scattering phase function for the disk. To understand the systematic errors associated with PSF subtraction, we also forward-modeled the observations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework and a simple model for the disk. We found that measurements of the disk geometric parameters were robust, with all of our analyses yielding consistent results; however, measurements of the scattering phase function were challenging to reconstruct from PSF-subtracted images, despite extensive testing. As a result, we estimated the scattering phase function using disk modeling. We searched for a dependence of the scattering phase function with respect to the GPI filters but found none. We compared theH-band scattering phase function with that measured by Hubble Space Telescope STIS at visual wavelengths and discovered a blue color at small scattering angles and a red color at large scattering angles, consistent with predictions and laboratory measurements of large grains. Finally, we successfully modeled the SPHEREH2HR 4796A scattered phase function using a distribution of hollow spheres composed of silicates, carbon, and metallic iron.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ALL-SKY SURVEY; LOW-MASS STARS; BROWN DWARFS; DISCOVERY; LUMINOSITY; CLASSIFICATION; KINEMATICS; PRIMEVAL; HYDROGEN; SAMPLE	We present the discoveries of WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 and WISEA J181006.18-101000.5, two low-temperature (1200-1400 K), high proper motion T-type subdwarfs. Both objects were discovered via their high proper motion (>0 ''.5 yr(-1)); WISEA J181006.18-101000.5 as part of the NEOWISE proper motion survey and WISEA J041451.67-585456.7 as part of the citizen science project Backyard Worlds; Planet 9. We have confirmed both as brown dwarfs with follow-up near-infrared spectroscopy. Their spectra and near-infrared colors are unique among known brown dwarfs, with some colors consistent with L-type brown dwarfs and other colors resembling those of the latest-type T dwarfs. While no forward model consistently reproduces the features seen in their near-infrared spectra, the closest matches suggest very low metallicities ([Fe/H] <= -1), making these objects likely the first examples of extreme subdwarfs of the T spectral class (esdT).

We measured the band areas and depths of a 2.2 mu m feature in these spectra, which has been attributed to ammonia-bearing species on other icy bodies. Ten spectra display prominent 2.2 mu m features with band areas and depths >2 sigma. We determined the longitudinal distribution of the 2.2 mu m band, finding no statistically meaningful differences between Ariel's leading and trailing hemispheres, indicating that this band is distributed across Ariel's surface. We compared the band centers and shapes of the five Ariel spectra displaying the strongest 2.2 mu m bands to laboratory spectra of various ammonia-bearing and ammonium-bearing species, finding that the spectral signatures of the Ariel spectra are best matched by ammonia-hydrates and flash frozen ammonia-water solutions. Our analysis also revealed that four Ariel spectra display 2.24 mu m bands (>2 sigma band areas and depths), with band centers and shapes that are best matched by ammonia ice. Because ammonia should be efficiently removed over short timescales by ultraviolet photons, cosmic rays, and charged particles trapped in Uranus' magnetosphere, the possible presence of this constituent supports geologic activity in the recent past, such as emplacement of ammonia-rich cryolavas and exposure of ammonia-rich deposits by tectonism, impact events, and mass wasting.

A Geologically Robust Procedure for Observing Rocky Exoplanets to Ensure that Detection of Atmospheric Oxygen Is a Modern Earth-like Biosignature	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Exoplanet systems; Exoplanet structure; Exoplanet astronomy; Stellar astronomy; Astrobiology; Biomarkers	VOLUME-LIMITED SAMPLE; X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY; MOLECULAR-OXYGEN; PLANETS; OCEAN; EVOLUTION; TIME; AGE; EMISSION; EROSITA	In the next decades, the astrobiological community will debate whether the first observations of oxygen in an exoplanet's atmosphere signify life, so it is critical to establish procedures now for collection and interpretation of such data. We present a step-by-step observational strategy for using oxygen as a robust biosignature to prioritize exoplanet targets and design future observations. It is premised on avoiding planets lacking subaerial weathering of continents, which would imply geochemical cycles drastically different from modern Earth's, precluding use of oxygen as a biosignature. The strategy starts with the most readily obtained data: orbital semimajor axis and stellar luminosity to ensure residence in the habitable zone and stellar X-ray/ultraviolet flux to ensure an exoplanet can retain a secondary (outgassed) atmosphere. Next, high-precision mass and radius information should be combined with high-precision stellar abundance data to constrain the exoplanet's water content; those incompatible with <0.1 wt% H2O can be deprioritized. Then, reflectance photometry or low-resolution transmission spectroscopy should confirm an optically thin atmosphere. Subsequent long-duration, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy should search for oxygen and ensure that water vapor and CO(2)are present only at low (similar to 10(2)-10(4)ppm levels). Assuming oxygen is found, attribution to life requires the most difficult step, acquisition of a detailed, multispectral light curve of the exoplanet, to ensure both surface land and water. Exoplanets failing some of these steps might be habitable, even have observable biogenic oxygen, but should be deprioritized because oxygen could not be attributed unambiguously to life, and life therefore would not be detectable on such planets. Finally, we show how to use this scheme for the solar system, the 55 Cnc system, and the TRAPPIST-1 system, in which only the Earth and TRAPPIST-1e successfully pass through our procedure.

Intraspecific genetic variation of a Fagus sylvatica population in a temperate forest derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy time series	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						imaging spectroscopy; intraspecific variation; partial least squares regression; population genetics; temperate forest	PHOTOSYNTHETIC TRAITS; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; BIODIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; IMAGERY; CONDUCTANCE; REGRESSION; PROTECTION; DIVERSITY; DEFENSE	The growing pace of environmental change has increased the need for large-scale monitoring of biodiversity. Declining intraspecific genetic variation is likely a critical factor in biodiversity loss, but is especially difficult to monitor: assessments of genetic variation are commonly based on measuring allele pools, which requires sampling of individuals and extensive sample processing, limiting spatial coverage. Alternatively, imaging spectroscopy data from remote platforms may hold the potential to reveal genetic structure of populations. In this study, we investigated how differences detected in an airborne imaging spectroscopy time series correspond to genetic variation within a population ofFagus sylvaticaunder natural conditions. We used multi-annual APEX (Airborne Prism Experiment) imaging spectrometer data from a temperate forest located in the Swiss midlands (Laegern, 47 degrees 28'N, 8 degrees 21'E), along with microsatellite data fromF. sylvaticaindividuals collected at the site. We identified variation in foliar reflectance independent of annual and seasonal changes which we hypothesize is more likely to correspond to stable genetic differences. We established a direct connection between the spectroscopy and genetics data by using partial least squares (PLS) regression to predict the probability of belonging to a genetic cluster from spectral data. We achieved the best genetic structure prediction by using derivatives of reflectance and a subset of wavebands rather than full-analyzed spectra. Our model indicates that spectral regions related to leaf water content, phenols, pigments, and wax composition contribute most to the ability of this approach to predict genetic structure ofF. sylvaticapopulation in natural conditions. This study advances the use of airborne imaging spectroscopy to assess tree genetic diversity at canopy level under natural conditions, which could overcome current spatiotemporal limitations on monitoring, understanding, and preventing genetic biodiversity loss imposed by requirements for extensive in situ sampling.

To date, however, the availability of such sources around 2 mu m has been scarce. Here, we present a frequency-modulated OFC operating around 2060 nm of wavelength exploiting the inherent gain nonlinearity of single-section GaSb-based quantum well diode lasers. A 2 mm long device operating as a self-starting comb outputs 50 mW of optical power over more than 10 nm of bandwidth while consuming <1 W of electrical power. Using the shifted-wave interference Fourier transform spectroscopy technique, we characterize the generated frequency-modulated waveform and demonstrate a linearly chirped intermodal phase relationship among the entire emission optical bandwidth. Furthermore, by compensating for the linear chirp using a single-mode optical fiber with opposite dispersion, 6 ps long optical pulses are generated. The frequency stability of the devices with similar to 19.3 GHz repetition rates allows us to perform mode-resolved free-running dual-comb spectroscopy. All rights reserved. (c) 2020 Author(s).

In this regime hydrodynamical instabilities may become important. In this work we investigate the gas and dust structure and dynamics for a typical T Tauri system under the influence of the vertical shear instability (VSI). We use global 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations covering all 360 degrees of azimuth with embedded particles of 0.1 and 1 mm size, evolved for 400 orbits. Stellar irradiation heating is included with opacities for 0.1-10 mu m sized dust. Saturated VSI turbulence produces a stress-to-pressure ratio of alpha is lowest within 30 au of the star, where thermal relaxation is slower relative to the orbital period and approaches the rate below which VSI is cut off. The rise in alpha from 20 to 30 au causes a dip in the surface density near 35 au, leading to Rossby wave instability and the generation of a stationary, long-lived vortex spanning about 4 au in radius and 40 au in azimuth. Our results confirm previous findings that millimeter-sized grains are strongly vertically mixed by the VSI. The scale height aspect ratio for 1 mm grains is determined to be 0.037, much higher than the valueH/r = 0.007 obtained from millimeter-wave observations of the HL Tau system. The measured aspect ratio is better fit by nonideal MHD models. In our VSI turbulence model, the millimeter grains drift radially inwards and many are trapped and concentrated inside the vortex. The turbulence induces a velocity dispersion of similar to 12 m s(-1)for the millimeter grains, indicating that grain-grain collisions could lead to fragmentation.

DES Collaboration	Chemical Analysis of the Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxy Grus II. Signature of High-mass Stellar Nucleosynthesis	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Chemical abundances; Dwarf galaxies; Chemically peculiar stars; Stellar abundances	METAL-POOR STARS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPY; ABUNDANCE RATIOS; NEUTRON-CAPTURE; EVOLUTION; ENRICHMENT; ELEMENTS; CARBON	We present a detailed abundance analysis of the three brightest member stars at the top of the giant branch of the ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Grus II. All stars exhibit a higher than expected [Mg/Ca] ratio compared to metal-poor stars in other UFD galaxies and in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Nucleosynthesis in high-mass (M) core-collapse supernovae has been shown to create this signature. The abundances of this small sample (three) stars suggests the chemical enrichment of Grus II could have occurred through substantial high-mass stellar evolution, and is consistent with the framework of a top-heavy initial mass function. However, with only three stars it cannot be ruled out that the abundance pattern is the result of a stochastic chemical enrichment at early times in the galaxy. The most metal-rich of the three stars also possesses a small enhancement in rapid neutron-capture (r-process) elements. The abundance pattern of ther-process elements in this star matches the scaledr-process pattern of the solar system andr-process enhanced stars in other dwarf galaxies and in the MW halo, hinting at a common origin for these elements across a range of environments. All current proposed astrophysical sites ofr-process element production are associated with high-mass stars, thus the possible top-heavy initial mass function of Grus II would increase the likelihood of any of these events occurring. The time delay between the alpha andr-process element enrichment of the galaxy favors a neutron star merger as the origin of ther-process elements in Grus II.	[Hansen, T. T.; Marshall, J.

Hydroxylated Mg-rich Amorphous Silicates: A New Component of the 3.2 mu m Absorption Band of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Astrochemistry; Comets; Laboratory astrophysics	EXPOSED WATER ICE; CRYSTALLINE OLIVINE; INTERPLANETARY DUST; ION IRRADIATION; ENERGY; EVOLUTION; AMORPHIZATION; MINERALOGY; ENSTATITE; INSIGHTS	The VIRTIS imaging spectrometer on board Rosetta has shown that the nucleus surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/CG) is characterized by a broad absorption band at around 3.2 mu m. The feature is ubiquitous across the surface and its attribution to (a) specific material(s) has been challenging. In the present Letter, we report an experimental investigation showing that the interaction of hydrogen atoms with Mg-rich amorphous silicates determines the formation of hydroxyl groups. The resulting IR spectrum exhibits a broad feature around 3.2 mu m similar to that of comet 67P/CG. Hapke's radiative transfer model was employed to estimate an upper limit contribution of 65% of hydroxylated silicates to the observed cometary band intensity. The presence of a hydroxylated fraction in silicates on the cometary surface would represent an evolutionary link between primitive objects of the solar system and dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), where silicate grains can be hydroxylated after having interacted with hydrogen atoms. This link is consistent with the detection of the aliphatic organics in 67P/CG that also originate in the ISM.

Minimum-Mass Limits for Streamlined Venus Atmospheric Probes	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article								Small, expendable drop probes are an attractive method for making measurements in the lower atmosphere of Venus, augmenting the capabilities of orbiters or aerial platforms that must remain in the benign temperature region above 50 km altitude. However, probe miniaturization is impeded by the need to provide thermal and pressure protection for conventional payloads. This paper determines the minimum mass limits for an insulated pressure vessel probe that operates all the way to the Venusian surface. Scaling laws for the probe performance and mass of major system components are explicitly derived using a simple model that captures the relevant physics. Streamlining the probe is found to be a highly effective strategy for lowering the system mass, but it also reduces the time available for data collection and transmission. Tradeoffs, guidelines, and design charts are presented for an array of miniaturized probes. Total system masses on the order of 5 kg are plausible with streamlined probes if the desired science measurements can be performed faster than a standard Venus descent timeline.

An investigation of autonav across the solar system is continued here by assessing optical-only navigation performance in cislunar space using simulated observations of the center of the moon, lunar landmarks, artificial satellites, and asteroids. It is shown that autonav in cislunar space is feasible and effective within current technological capabilities, and that artificial satellites, the moon center, and lunar landmarks are effective targets for navigation in this region.

Hot Dust-obscured Galaxies with Excess Blue Light	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Active galaxies; Galaxy evolution; High-redshift galaxies; Quasars; Infrared galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; QUASARS; STARBURST99; MORPHOLOGY; SCATTERING; EVOLUTION; MERGERS; GROWTH; GRAINS	Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are among the most luminous galaxies in the universe. Powered by highly obscured, possibly Compton-thick, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Hot DOGs are characterized by spectral energy distributions that are very red in the mid-infrared yet dominated by the host galaxy stellar emission in the UV and optical. An earlier study identified a subsample of Hot DOGs with significantly enhanced UV emission. One target, W0204-0506, was studied in detail and, based on Chandra observations, it was concluded that the enhanced emission was most likely due to either extreme unobscured star formation (star formation rate > 1000Myr(-1)) or to light from the highly obscured AGN scattered by gas or dust into our line of sight. Here, we present a follow-up study of W0204-0506 as well as two more Hot DOGs with excess UV emission. For the two new objects we obtained Chandra/ACIS-S observations, and for all three targets we obtained Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 F555W and F160W imaging. The analysis of these observations, combined with multiwavelength photometry and UV/optical spectroscopy suggests that UV emission is most likely dominated by light from the central highly obscured, hyperluminous AGN that has been scattered into our line of sight, by either gas or dust. We cannot decisively rule out, however, that star formation or a second AGN in the system may significantly contribute to the UV excess of these targets.	[Assef, R.

Persistent Starspot Signals on M Dwarfs: Multiwavelength Doppler Observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder and Keck/HIRES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						M dwarf stars; Radial velocity; Stellar photometry; High resolution spectroscopy; Exoplanets; Starspots; Time series analysis; Gaussian Processes regression	LOW MASS STARS; STELLAR ROTATION; EXOPLANET-SURVEY; AD LEONIS; PHOTOMETRY; PRECISION; FREQUENCY; FLARES; FIELD	Young, rapidly rotating M dwarfs exhibit prominent starspots, which create quasiperiodic signals in their photometric and Doppler spectroscopic measurements. The periodic Doppler signals can mimic radial velocity (RV) changes expected from orbiting exoplanets. Exoplanets can be distinguished from activity-induced false positives by the chromaticity and long-term incoherence of starspot signals, but these qualities are poorly constrained for fully convective M stars. Coherent photometric starspot signals on M dwarfs may persist for hundreds of rotations, and the wavelength dependence of starspot RV signals may not be consistent between stars due to differences in their magnetic fields and active regions. We obtained precise multiwavelength RVs of four rapidly rotating M dwarfs (AD Leo, G227-22, GJ 1245B, GJ 3959) using the near-infrared (NIR) Habitable-zone Planet Finder and the optical Keck/HIRES spectrometer. Our RVs are complemented by photometry from Kepler, TESS, and the Las Cumbres Observatory network of telescopes. We found that all four stars exhibit large spot-induced Doppler signals at their rotation periods, and investigated the longevity and optical-to-NIR chromaticity for these signals. The phase curves remain coherent much longer than is typical for Sunlike stars. Their chromaticity varies, and one star (GJ 3959) exhibits optical and NIR RV modulation consistent in both phase and amplitude. In general, though, we find that the NIR amplitudes are lower than their optical counterparts. We conclude that starspot modulation for rapidly rotating M stars frequently remains coherent for hundreds of stellar rotations and gives rise to Doppler signals that, due to this coherence, may be mistaken for exoplanets.

Two parts have been chosen for this article: the LP2953 positive regulator and the LT1175 negative regulator. Different failure mechanisms are observed, which can be modeled with radiation-enabled SPICE simulations. The simulation results are shown to compare well with experimental data. Both voltage regulators contain three blocks, essential for accurate modeling: a bandgap reference, a power pass transistor, and an error amplifier. In this article, simulations were performed on each block independently to analyze the trends in parametric degradation after radiation exposure and describe the failure mechanisms. This article identifies the bandgap circuitry as the primary cause of failure for the negative regulator while degradations in all blocks contribute to the TID response of circuits.

Simple geometries with aluminum, tantalum, and a combination of both materials were used to represent typical and high-density shields. The forward Monte Carlo (FMC) analyses from MCNP and Geant4 were in good agreement within run uncertainty. Compared to FMC results, the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) analysis results from NOVICE and FASTRAD differed by +/- 20% similar to +/- 50%, depending on the simple geometry material. The doses from FASTRAD's ray-tracing methods differed from NOVICE RMC doses by +60%/-10%. TID analyses of complex as-designed geometries from selected flight instruments and electronics boxes were also compared using the NOVICE and FASTRAD tools. The TID results from these complex geometries with aluminum equivalent thickness ranging from 0.1 to 3000 mil (3 in) differed by as much as +200%/-50% between FASTRAD (ray-tracing and RMC) and NOVICE analyses. We conclude that while MCNP and Geant4 FMC analysis results have extensive experimental validation and therefore provide the most accurate TID estimates, RMC analyses are faster to implement and suitable as conservative tools for missions with a sufficient mass margin. We also conclude that ray-tracing analyses can be suitable during the development phase of shield design optimization for its fast runtime capability.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics.

The mutually complementary Euclid and Roman galaxy redshift surveys will use H alpha- and [Oiii]-selected emission-line galaxies (ELGs) as tracers of the large-scale structure at 0.9 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 1.9 (H alpha) and 1.5 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 2.7 ([Oiii]). It is essential to have a reliable and sufficiently precise knowledge of the expected numbers of H alpha-emitting galaxies in the survey volume in order to optimize these redshift surveys for the study of dark energy. Additionally, these future samples of ELGs will, like all slitless spectroscopy surveys, be affected by a complex selection function that depends on galaxy size and luminosity, line equivalent width (EW), and redshift errors arising from the misidentification of single ELGs. Focusing on the specifics of the Euclid survey, we combine two slitless spectroscopic WFC3-IR data sets-3D-HST+AGHAST and the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel survey-to construct a Euclid-like sample that covers an area of 0.56 deg(2)and includes 1277 ELGs. We detect 1091 (similar to 3270 deg(-2)) H alpha+[Nii]-emitting galaxies in the range 0.9 <= z <= 1.6 and 162 (similar to 440 deg(-2)) [Oiii] lambda 5007 emitters over 1.5 <= z <= 2.3 with line fluxes >= 2 x 10(-16)erg s(-1)cm(-2). The median of the H alpha+[Nii] EW distribution is similar to 250 A, and the effective radii of the continuum and H alpha+[Nii] emission are correlated with a median of similar to 038 and significant scatter (sigma similar to 02-035). Finally, we explore the prevalence of redshift misidentification in future Euclid samples, finding potential contamination rates of similar to 14%-20% and similar to 6% down to 2 x 10(-16)erg s(-1)cm(-2)and 6 x 10(-17)erg s(-1)cm(-2), respectively, although with increased wavelength coverage these percentages drop to nearly zero.

Patterns of population displacement during mega-fires in California detected using Facebook Disaster Maps	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Facebook disaster maps; crowdsourced data; social media; Mann-Kendall trend; anomaly analysis; wildfires; California	SOCIAL MEDIA; TWITTER; MANAGEMENT; HAZARDS	The Facebook Disaster Maps (FBDM) work presented here is the first time this platform has been used to provide analysis-ready population change products derived from crowdsourced data targeting disaster relief practices. We evaluate the representativeness of FBDM data using the Mann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an anomaly analysis to reveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement during the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results show that the distribution of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total population from different sources. Due to usage habits, the elder population is underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California, FBDM data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the placing and lifting of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population revealed the areas with the greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced residents. A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a densely populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one, possibly due to better access to transportation. In sparsely populated fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized to move people to shelters as the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while their counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to seek temporary stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with an assessment on underrepresented communities, FBDM data and the derivatives can provide much needed information of near real-time population displacement for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder decision-making.

We quantify a measure of how much confidence we should have for each candidate galaxy from different selections and what the conservative error estimates propagated into our selection are. Then we compare the evolution of the corresponding number densities and their stellar mass density with numerical simulations, semianalytical models, and previous observational estimates, which shows slight tension at higher redshifts as the models tend to underestimate the number and mass densities. By estimating the average halo masses of the candidates (M-h 4.2, 1.9, and 1.3 x 10(12)Mfor redshift bins centered atz = 3.4, 4.1, and 4.7), we find them to be consistent with halos that were efficient in turning baryons to stars, relatively immune to the feedback effects, and on the verge of transition into hot-mode accretion. This can suggest the relative cosmological starvation of the cold gas followed by an overconsumption phase in which the galaxy rapidly consumes the available cold gas as one of the possible drivers for the quenching of the massive evolved population at high redshift.

DES Collaboration	Supernova host galaxies in the dark energy survey: I. Deep coadds, photometry, and stellar masses	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: image processing; catalogues; supernovae: general	IA SUPERNOVAE; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; DATA RELEASE; SPECTROSCOPY; CLUSTERS; PEGASE; STARS	The 5-yr Dark Energy Survey Supernova Programme (DES-SN) is one of the largest and deepest transient surveys to date in terms of volume and number of supernovae. Identifying and characterizing the host galaxies of transients plays a key role in their classification, the study of their formation mechanisms, and the cosmological analyses. To derive accurate host galaxy properties, we create depth-optimized coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images that are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five DES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other four seasons such that each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order similar to 27 in g band, and have a much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates, particularly for faint objects. We present the resulting multiband photometry of host galaxies for samples of spectroscopically confirmed type Ia (SNe Ia), core-collapse (CCSNe), and superluminous (SLSNe) as well as rapidly evolving transients (RETs) discovered by DES-SN. We derive host galaxy stellar masses and probabilistically compare stellar-mass distributions to samples from other surveys. We find that the DES spectroscopically confirmed sample of SNe Ia selects preferentially fewer high-mass hosts at high-redshift compared to other surveys, while at low redshift the distributions are consistent. DES CCSNe and SLSNe hosts are similar to other samples, while RET hosts are unlike the hosts of any other transients, although these differences have not been disentangled from selection effects.

ALMA reveals the coherence of the magnetic field geometry in OH 231.8+4.2	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						magnetic fields; polarization; stars: AGB and post-AGB; ISM: individual objects: OH231.8+4.2; ISM: jets and outflows	RADIATIVE TORQUES; NEBULA; ALIGNMENT; POLARIZATION; DUST	In a continuing effort to investigate the role of magnetic fields in evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars (principally regarding the shaping of their envelopes), we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) high-resolution polarization data obtained for the nebula OH 231.8+4.2. We found that the polarized emission likely arises from aligned grains in the presence of magnetic fields rather than radiative alignment and self-scattering. The ALMA data show well organized electric field orientations in most of the nebula and the inferred magnetic field vectors (rotated by 90 degrees) trace an hourglass morphology centred on the central system of the nebula. One region in the southern part of OH 231.8+4.2 shows a less organized distribution probably due to the shocked environment. These findings, in conjunction with earlier investigations (maser studies and dust emission analysis at other scales and wavelengths) suggest an overall magnetic hourglass located inside a toroidal field. We propose the idea that the magnetic field structure is closely related to the architecture of a magnetic tower and that the outflows were therefore magnetically launched. While the current dynamical effect of the fields might be weak in the equatorial plane principally due to the evolution of the envelope, it would still be affecting the outflows. In that regard, the measurement of the magnetic field at the stellar surface, which is still missing, combined with a full magnetohydrodynamic treatment are required to better understand and constrain the events occurring in OH 231.8+4.2.

DES Collaboration	Studying Type II supernovae as cosmological standard candles using the Dark Energy Survey	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						(stars:) supernovae: general; galaxies: distances and redshifts; (cosmology:) distance scale	PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; K-CORRECTIONS; IA SUPERNOVA; P SUPERNOVAE; HUBBLE DIAGRAM; LIGHT CURVES; MASSIVE STARS; LEGACY SURVEY; REDSHIFT; LAMBDA	Despite vast improvements in the measurement of the cosmological parameters, the nature of dark energy and an accurate value of the Hubble constant (H-0) in the Hubble-Lemaitre law remain unknown. To break the current impasse, it is necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the use of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will be an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II will be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and spectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our DES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method (SCM), we construct the largest available Hubble diagram with SNe II in the Hubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We demonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardization does not reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as distance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their utility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a more standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate more observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we perform simulations to estimate the redshift-dependent distance-modulus bias due to selection effects.	[de Jaeger, T.; Filippenko, A.

Resolving the Status of the Lithium-rich M Dwarfs HHJ 339 and HHJ 430	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Moving clusters; Star clusters; Open star clusters	T-TAURI STARS; DEPLETION BOUNDARY AGE; CLUSTER; ABUNDANCES; NEARBY; MYR	Oppenheimer et al. discovered two M5 dwarfs in the Pleiades with nearly primordial lithium. These stars are not low enough in mass to represent the leading edge of the lithium depletion boundary at Pleiades age (similar to 125 Myr). A possible explanation for the enhanced lithium in these stars is that they are actually not members of the Pleiades but instead are members of a younger moving group seen in projection toward the Pleiades. We have used data from Gaia DR2 to confirm that these two stars, HHJ 339 and HHJ 430, are indeed not members of the Pleiades. Based on their space motions, parallaxes, and positions in a Gaia-based color-magnitude diagram, it is probable that these two stars are about 40 parsecs foreground to the Pleiades and have ages of similar to 25 Myr. Kinematically they are best matched to the 32 Ori moving group.

J	Milliner, C; Donnellan, A				Milliner, Chris; Donnellan, Andrea			Using Daily Observations from Planet Labs Satellite Imagery to Separate the Surface Deformation between the 4 July M-w 6.4 Foreshock and 5 July M-w 7.1 Mainshock during the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake Sequence	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article								On 4 July 2019, the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence began with a series of foreshocks including an M-w 6.4 event near Searles Valley, California. This was then followed 34 hr later by an M-w 7.1 mainshock located just 15 km to the north, with the earthquake sequence resulting in a complex array of intersecting faults. This earthquake sequence poses several interesting questions including, did the stress changes induced by the M-w 6.4 foreshock trigger the M-w 7.1 mainshock and what possible mechanism(s) could explain the occurrence of widespread secondary faulting surrounding both surface ruptures? However, most of the geodetic data (such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, light detection and ranging, and optical satellite imagery) were acquired after both events had occurred making it difficult to discern which surface fractures happened when and their possible triggering mechanism. Here, we provide a dataset composed of high-resolution optical imagery, pixel-value difference maps, .kmz fracturing mapping, and horizontal deformation maps derived from subpixel image correlation, which can uniquely separate the surface fracturing and deformation between the foreshock and mainshock events that can help answer these questions. Separate imaging of the events is made possible by the daily acquisition of optical imagery by the Planet Labs cubesat constellation, which acquired data between the two earthquakes, in the morning of 4 and 5 July, at 11.13 a.m. and 05.12 p.m. PST, respectively, with the images acquired just 40 min after the foreshock and 56 min before the mainshock, respectively. Analysis from this optical imagery reveals the location of surface faulting that allows us to map their spatial extent and determine their timing. These data which we provide here can help guide and validate field survey observations to help understand which faults ruptured when, and constrain slip inversion models for more accurate estimates of stress changes induced by the foreshock imposed on the surrounding faults.

We integrated geodetic measurements for the 3D vector field of coseismic surface deformation for the two events, using SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites. We combined less precise large-scale displacements from SAR images by pixel offset tracking or matching, including the along-track component, with the more precise SAR interferometry (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar [InSAR]) measurements in the radar line of sight (LoS) direction and intermediate-precision along-track InSAR to estimate all three components of the surface displacement for the two events together. We also estimated the coseismic deformation for the two earthquakes from time-series processing of continuous Global Navigation Satellite System data stations in the area. InSAR coherence and coherence change maps the surface disruptions due to fault ruptures reaching the surface. Large slip in the M-w 6.4 earthquake was on a NE-striking fault that intersects with the NW-striking fault that was the main rupture in the M-w 7.1 earthquake. The main fault bifurcates towards the southeast ending 3 km from the Garlock Fault. The Garlock fault had triggered slip of about 20 mm in the radar LoS along a short section directly south of the main rupture. About 3 km northwest of the M-w 7.1 epicenter, the surface fault separates into two strands that form a pull-apart with about 1 m of downdrop. Further northwest is a wide zone of complex deformation.

Cascading Partial Rupture of the Flores Thrust during the 2018 Lombok Earthquake Sequence, Indonesia	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							7.8 GORKHA EARTHQUAKE; EASTERN SUNDA ARC; STRESS CHANGES; MAGMA PATHWAY; ERUPTIONS; GRAVITY; VOLCANO; RADAR; DEFORMATION; STRAIN	A series of four M w 6 earthquakes struck the northern region of Lombok, eastern Indonesia, in a span of three weeks from late July to mid -August 2018. The series was thought to be associated with the Flores thrust, but the exact mechanism causing the unusual earthquake series has remained elusive. Our Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar analysis, combined with insights from seismology, indicates that the events originated at different hypocenter depths with differing fault geometries, which may explain the cascading behavior of the events, and indicates that better imaging of active fault geometry might provide some insight into future rupture behavior on other similar thrust systems. Our static stress change calculations suggest that the earlier events in the sequence played a role in promoting the later events. In addition, the second event brought the most significant impact on a nearby volcano, by causing volumetric expan- sion at its shallow magma plumbing system and unclamping its magma ascent zone, which may potentially have an impact on its future eruptive activity. However, no volcanic activity has so far occurred after the earthquakes. Finally, our damage proxy maps suggest that the second event caused the greatest damage to buildings.

Characterization of the Nucleus, Morphology, and Activity of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov by Optical and Near-infrared GROWTH, Apache Point, IRTF, ZTF, and Keck Observations	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Comets; Minor planets	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; ENSEMBLE PROPERTIES; ASTEROIDS; DUST; SCATTERING; TELESCOPE; COLOR; SIZE; 67P/CHURYUMOV-GERASIMENKO; SPECTROSCOPY	We present visible and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of interstellar object (ISO) 2I/Borisov taken from 2019 September 10 to 2019 December 20 using the GROWTH, the Apache Point Observatory Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m, and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility 3.0 m combined with pre- and postdiscovery observations of 2I obtained by the Zwicky Transient Facility from 2019 March 17 to 2019 May 5. Comparison with imaging of distant solar system comets shows an object very similar to mildly active solar system comets with an outgassing rate of similar to 10(27)mol s(-1). The photometry, taken in filters spanning the visible and NIR range, shows a gradual brightening trend of similar to 0.03 mag day(-1)since 2019 September 10 UTC for a reddish object becoming neutral in the NIR. The light curve from recent and prediscovery data reveals a brightness trend suggesting the recent onset of significant H2O sublimation with the comet being active with super volatiles such as CO at heliocentric distances >6 au consistent with its extended morphology. Using the advanced capability to significantly reduce the scattered light from the coma enabled by high-resolution NIR images from Keck adaptive optics taken on 2019 October 4, we estimate a diameter for 2I's nucleus of less than or similar to 1.4 km. We use the size estimates of 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov to roughly estimate the slope of the ISO size distribution, resulting in a slope of similar to 3.4 1.2, similar to solar system comets and bodies produced from collisional equilibrium.

These spectral features may provide insight into the emission mechanism of repeating FRBs, or they could possibly be explained by extrinsic propagation effects in the local environment. Broadband observations can better quantify this behavior and help to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects. We present results from a simultaneous 2.25 and 8.36 GHz observation of the repeating FRB 121102 using the 70 m Deep Space Network radio telescope, DSS-43. During the 5.7 hr continuous observing session, we detected six bursts from FRB 121102, which were visible in the 2.25 GHz frequency band. However, none of these bursts were detected in the 8.36 GHz band, despite the larger bandwidth and greater sensitivity in the higher-frequency band. This effect is not explainable by Galactic scintillation and, along with previous multi-band experiments, clearly demonstrates that apparent burst activity depends strongly on the radio frequency band that is being observed.

Opposite-Side Ambiguities in Radar Sounding Interferometry	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Interferometry; Radar tracking; Airborne radar; Radar antennas; Clutter; Radar clutter; Clutter discrimination; interferometry; Polarimetric Airborne Radar Ice Sounder (POLARIS); radar; radar sounders; radar sounding	ANTARCTICA	We report the analysis of opposite-side ambiguities in single-pass radar sounding interferometry. Nadir pointing radar sounders suffer inherent cross track ambiguities that cannot be separated with the power image alone. Interferometry can be used to interpret these ambiguities when data are collected with multichannel receivers. However, opposite-side surface clutter, volume scattering, and cross track range misalignment create unique interferometric phase and correlation signatures. Such signatures are observed experimentally in data collected by the Polarimetric Airborne Radar Ice Sounder (POLARIS) P-band multichannel radar sounder. We derive analytic expressions to predict the observations and validate them with simulation. In addition, we observe and explain a correlation dropout feature that is due to volume scattering competing with surface clutter in the null of the cross track antenna pattern. The purpose of this article is to explain opposite-side ambiguity signatures in radar sounder interferometry and provide models and techniques for scientific interpretation of interferograms.

The new algorithms improve spectral convergence both at the poles of the spherical-polar grid and at future null infinity, as well as increase the temporal resolution of the code. The key to the success of these algorithms is a new set of high-accuracy tests, which we present here. We demonstrate the accuracy of the code and compare with the existing PITTNULL implementation.

Interpreting the Cratering Histories of Bennu, Ryugu, and Other Spacecraft-explored Asteroids	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Main belt asteroids; Near-Earth objects	SIZE-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; INDUCED SEISMIC ACTIVITY; MAIN-BELT; 21 LUTETIA; 433 EROS; COLLISIONAL HISTORY; MAGNITUDE DISTRIBUTION; ELEMENTAL COMPOSITION; DYNAMICAL EVOLUTION; IMPACT CRATERS	Asteroid crater retention ages have unknown accuracy because projectile-crater scaling laws are difficult to verify. At the same time, our knowledge of asteroid and crater size-frequency distributions has increased substantially over the past few decades. These advances make it possible to empirically derive asteroid crater scaling laws by fitting model asteroid size distributions to crater size distributions from asteroids observed by spacecraft. ForD > 10 km diameter asteroids like Ceres, Vesta, Lutetia, Mathilde, Ida, Eros, and Gaspra, the best matches occur when the ratio of crater to projectile sizes isf similar to 10. The same scaling law applied to 0.3 D < 2.5 km near-Earth asteroids such as Bennu, Ryugu, Itokawa, and Toutatis yield intriguing yet perplexing results. When applied to the largest craters on these asteroids, we obtain crater retention ages of similar to 1 billion years for Bennu, Ryugu, and Itokawa and similar to 2.5 billion years for Toutatis. These ages agree with the estimated formation ages of their source families and could suggest that the near-Earth asteroid population is dominated by bodies that avoided disruption during their traverse across the main asteroid belt. An alternative interpretation is thatf >> 10, which would make their crater retention ages much younger. If true, crater scaling laws need to change in a substantial way betweenD > 10 km asteroids, wheref similar to 10, and 0.3 D < 2.5 km asteroids, wheref >> 10.	[Bottke, W. F.; Marchi, S.; Walsh, K.

Akana			TOI-1235 b: A Keystone Super-Earth for Testing Radius Valley Emergence Models around Early M Dwarfs	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radial velocity; M dwarf stars; Transit photometry; Exoplanet formation; Exoplanet structure	POWERED MASS-LOSS; ERROR-CORRECTION; PLANETS; STARS; TEMPERATURES; ATMOSPHERES; DEPENDENCE; ROTATION; CATALOG; SEARCH	Small planets on close-in orbits tend to exhibit envelope mass fractions of either effectively zero or up to a few percent depending on their size and orbital period. Models of thermally driven atmospheric mass loss and of terrestrial planet formation in a gas-poor environment make distinct predictions regarding the location of this rocky/ nonrocky transition in period-radius space. Here we present the confirmation of TOI-1235 b (P.=.3.44 days, = r 1.738+ p 0.0760.087 RA), a planet whose size and period are intermediate between the competing model predictions, thus making the system an important test case for emergence models of the rocky/nonrocky transition around early M dwarfs (Rs.=.0.630.+/-.0.015 R., Ms.=.0.640.+/-.0.016 M.). We confirm the TESS planet discovery using reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometry, high-resolution imaging, and a set of 38 precise radial velocities (RVs) from HARPS-N and HIRES. We measure a planet mass of 6.91+ 0.850.75 MA, which implies an iron core mass fraction of 20+ 1215% in the absence of a gaseous envelope. The bulk composition of TOI-1235 b is therefore consistent with being Earth-like, and we constrain an H/He envelope mass fraction to be <0.5% at 90% confidence. Our results are consistent with model predictions from thermally driven atmospheric mass loss but not with gas-poor formation, suggesting that the former class of processes remains efficient at sculpting close-in planets around early M dwarfs. Our RV analysis also reveals a strong periodicity close to the first harmonic of the photometrically determined stellar rotation period that we treat as stellar activity, despite other lines of evidence favoring a planetary origin ( = P 21.8+ 0.80.9 days, = m sin i 13.0+ p 5.33.8 MA) that cannot be firmly ruled out by our data.

We targeted nearby (less than or similar to 150 pc), young (less than or similar to 500 Myr) stars with high infrared (IR) excesses (L-IR/L-* > 10(-5)), including 38 with previously resolved disks. Observations were made using the GPI high-contrast integral field spectrograph inH-band (1.6 mu m) coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities. We resolved 26 debris disks and 3 protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris disks except HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of nondetections. Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination, although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging for detecting low-inclination disks (less than or similar to 70 degrees). Based on postsurvey statistics, we improved upon our presurvey target prioritization metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter detections. ComparingH-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative evidence for differing grain properties.

ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control and high-stability thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 05 rms pointing stability and 10 mK thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass class. ASTERIA launched in 2017 August and deployed from the International Space Station in 2017 November. During the prime mission (2017 November-2018 February) and the first extended mission that followed (2018 March-2018 May), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations, which included the collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom pipeline to correct complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to simultaneously detrend the photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e (similar to 2R(circle plus)), measuring a transit depth of 374 +/- 170 ppm. This is the first detection of an exoplanet transit by a CubeSat. The successful detection of super-Earth 55 Cancri e demonstrates that small, inexpensive spacecraft can deliver high-precision photometric measurements.

This paper describes the observations, analysis techniques and results of all the Enceladus occultations observed by Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and other observations designed to study the plume. Limits on gas at non-polar latitudes are derived. Constraints on the minor constituents' composition of Enceladus' primarily water vapor plume are evaluated. The overall source rate variability over a time span of 13 years is < 15%, although gas output in collimated supersonic jets may vary diurnally. The average source rate for water molecules is 300 kg/s. Local enhancement of gas in the plume due to supersonic gas jets is still detectable at heights over 100 km.	[Hansen, C. J.; Hendrix, A.

Titan's impact crater population after Cassini	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Titan, surface; Impact processes; Radar observations; Geological processes	CENTRAL PEAK; RADAR; MORPHOLOGY; SURFACE; TOPOGRAPHY; SATELLITES; GANYMEDE; EROSION; EJECTA; SAR	Titan is Saturn's largest moon and has a dynamic surface with methane rivers carved by an active hydrological cycle and sand seas shaped by aeolian processes. One way to study the rates of these processes is by examining Titan's impact craters, because they provide quantitative constraints on the level of degradation. With the end of the Cassini Mission in September 2017, we have reassessed the crater population using the entire Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) dataset, including 30 additional craters since the last assessment in 2012, for a total of 90 certain to possible impact craters on Titan. We adjust for incomplete coverage (similar to 69%) of the moon by SAR imaging using a Monte-Carlo approach, and find no major change in Titan's inferred surface age from prior studies. We then used the SARTopo and stereo topography data sets to measure crater depths and diameters. For the first time, rim heights for twelve craters were also reported. On average, Titan's craters are shown to be shallower, with lower rims, than those observed on similarly sized icy moons (e.g. Ganymede). This suggests that the observed modification is due to a combination of sand and sediment infilling onto the crater floor and fluvial erosion of the rims with fluvial erosion playing a larger role than previously thought in crater degradation on Titan.

We define four subtypes of labyrinth terrains: valleyed, polygonal, finely-dissected, and the possible outlier Kronin Labyrinth. We mapped the locations of all labyrinths imaged by Cassini and found they are distributed preferentially at high latitudes. We characterize the labyrinths by morphometric parameters such as intervalley width, valley width, and percent valleys. We find many labyrinths contain closed valleys, which constrains their formation and evolution. We also examine their low microwave emissivity spectral characteristics and find that the labyrinths are consistent with a bulk composition of dominantly organic materials, with some component of water ice - characteristics similar to Titan's undifferentiated plains. Our analyses show that labyrinths are ancient terrains - only the mountains and hummocky terrains are older. This implies that significant organic production occurred early in Titan's history. The organic inventory represented by the labyrinths is estimated to be 15-42% of the solid organic inventory of Titan (or 14-35% of the total surface organics, if the hydrocarbons of the lakes and seas are also included). Our preferred formation of the labyrinth terrains is erosion through dissolution and fluvial processes that dissect the plateaux in a manner similar to dissolution geology (karst) on Earth. This scenario requires that the organics that make up the labyrinth terrain be soluble in methane and/or ethane liquids. It also suggests that the origin of the plateaux may have derived from Titan's past chemical production and subsequent depositional record.	[Malaska, Michael J.; Lopes, Rosaly M.

Spectral and emissivity analysis of the raised ramparts around Titan's northern lakes	ICARUS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Cassini Science Symposium	AUG, 2018	Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO	Cassini Huygens Miss	Univ Colorado	Titan surface; Titan hydrology; Radar observations; Spectroscopy; Radiative transfer	SURFACE; RADAR; BATHYMETRY; ATMOSPHERE; ETHANE; VIMS	Some of Titan's small northern hemisphere lakes show raised rampart features (which are distinct from raised rims), and appear as SAR-bright mound-like annuli extending away from the lake for up to tens of kilometers from the shoreline. We investigate the infrared and microwave characteristics of these features using Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) and RADAR data. A spectral comparative analysis is performed among the lakes, their ramparts, and the surrounding regions. We overcome the profound difference in spatial resolution between VIMS and SAR data by using a method that provides overlays between the spectral images and SAR, thus enabling the correct selection of VIMS pixels. The surface properties of the selected areas are obtained using a radiative transfer analysis on the selected VIMS pixels, in addition to emissivity obtained from the RADAR in radiometry mode. Analysis of these combined and co-registered data provides constraints for the formation mechanism(s) of raised ramparts. The results show that the emissivity of the raised ramparts is close to that of Titan's labyrinthic terrains and to that of empty lake floors in the northern polar regions. This is confirmed by the VIMS analysis that also shows that the infrared spectral response of the raised ramparts is very similar to that of some empty lake floors. This suggests that both areas are made from or are covered by a similar material. In addition, two out of the eight lakes with raised ramparts show spectral differences at three specific wavelengths, 1.6, 2.0, and 5.0 mu m, between the ramparts and the surrounding terrain. We hypothesize that this could be due to some component, or mixture of components in the ramparts that is less absorbent at these specific wavelengths, or it could be an effect of different grain sizes. These observations provide first insights into the possible mechanisms leading to the formation of the raised ramparts that are discussed here.

In this study, we examine the similarities and differences between the dynamics governing these events in these two regions. In the Ohio Valley, extreme precipitation events are associated with midlatitude synoptic-scale convergence northeast of cyclones and a southwestward oriented ridge near the Atlantic coast that drives strong water vapor transport from the Gulf of Mexico into the Ohio Valley. In the northwestern United States, extreme precipitation events are associated with a cyclonic and anticyclonic circulation pair aligned northwest to southeast, which together drive a long and strong moisture transport corridor from the lower latitude of the central Pacific Ocean toward the northwestern United States. Moisture budget analysis shows that moisture convergence due to dynamical convergence dominates in the Ohio Valley, whereas moisture advection dominates over the Pacific Northwest. Differences between the cases in the same region are examined by an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis conducted on the vertically integrated moisture flux. Different EOFs highlight shifts in spatial location, orientation, and intensity of the moisture flux but demonstrate consistent roles of dynamics in the two regions. Composites based on these EOFs highlight the range of likely synoptic scenarios that can give rise to precipitation extremes over these two regions.	[Ma, Chen-Geng; Chang, Edmund K.

JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Empirical orthogonal functions; Climate variability; Multidecadal variability; Oscillations; Pacific decadal oscillation	SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; 20TH-CENTURY CLIMATE SIMULATIONS; TROPICAL ATLANTIC; SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; NORTH PACIFIC; SALINITY ANOMALIES; SAHEL RAINFALL; GLOBAL MODES; FREQUENCY; ENSO	The Atlantic and Pacific basin are found linked in the context of multidecadal SST variability from analyses of 118 years of observational data. Recurrent spatiotemporal variability, including multidecadal modes, was identified using the extended-EOF technique in a longitudinally global domain, allowing unfettered expression of interbasin interactions. The physicality of the obtained decadal modes was assessed using fishery records and analog counts. A three-mode structure withbi-directional interbasin links frames the new perspective on the cycling of multidecadal SST variability. The three modes are the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO), low-frequency North Atlantic Oscillation (LF-NAO), and North Pacific decadal variability [PDV-NP; resembling negative (-ve) PDO]. The two previously documented links AMO -> PDV-NP (with similar to 12.5-yr lead) and LF-NAO -> AMO (with 16-yr lead) are corroborated, while a third one, PDV-NP ->(-LF-NAO) with similar to 6.5-yr lead, is uncovered. The interaction triad closes the loop on the cycling of multidecadal SST variability, generating AMO's phase reversal in similar to 35 years, consistent with its widely noted similar to 70-yr time scale. The two previously noted links-one intrabasin and one interbasin-were unsuccessful in this regard. Other findings include the deeper subsurface extensions of Atlantic multidecadal SST variability, and the hitherto unrecognized similarity of Pan-Pacific decadal variability and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Instrumental records, albeit short in the context of multidecadal variability, must continue to be mined for insights into the functioning of the climate system as its model representations while improving, remain inadequate.

A Pair of TESS Planets Spanning the Radius Valley around the Nearby Mid-M Dwarf LTT 3780	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radial velocity; M dwarf stars; Exoplanet systems; Transit photometry	POWERED MASS-LOSS; ERROR-CORRECTION; PHOTOMETRY; DEPENDENCE	We present the confirmation of two new planets transiting the nearby mid-M dwarf LTT 3780 (TIC 36724087, TOI-732, V = 13.07, K-s = 8.204, R-s = 0.374 R<sub, M-s = 0.401 M-circle dot, d = 22 pc). The two planet candidates are identified in a single Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite sector and validated with reconnaissance spectroscopy, ground-based photometric follow-up, and high-resolution imaging. With measured orbital periods of P-b = 0.77, P-c = 12.25 days and sizes r(p,b) = 1.33 0.07, r(p,c) = 2.30 0.16 R-circle plus, the two planets span the radius valley in period-radius space around low-mass stars, thus making the system a laboratory to test competing theories of the emergence of the radius valley in that stellar mass regime. By combining 63 precise radial velocity measurements from the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) and HARPS-N, we measure planet masses of M-circle plus, which indicates that LTT 3780b has a bulk composition consistent with being Earth-like, while LTT 3780c likely hosts an extended H/He envelope. We show that the recovered planetary masses are consistent with predictions from both photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss models. The brightness and small size of LTT 3780, along with the measured planetary parameters, render LTT 3780b and c as accessible targets for atmospheric characterization of planets within the same planetary system and spanning the radius valley.

We analyze the new AERONET Version 3 data that have significant changes to cloud screening algorithms, allowing many more fine-mode observations in the near vicinity of clouds or fog. Case studies for detailed investigation include May 25-26, 2016 when cloud fraction was high over much of the peninsula, associated with a weak frontal passage and advection of pollution from China. These cloud-influenced Chinese transport dates also had the highest aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface PM2.5 concentrations and fine mode particle sizes of the entire campaign. Another likewise cloud/high relative humidity (RH) case is June 9 and 10, 2016 when fog was present over the Yellow Sea that appears to have affected aerosol properties well downwind over the Korean peninsula. In comparison we also investigated aerosol properties on air stagnation days with very low cloud cover and relatively low RH (May 17 & 18, 2016), when local Korean emissions dominated. Aerosol volume size distributions show marked differences between the transport days (with high RH and cloud influences) and the local pollution stagnation days, with total column-integrated particle fine mode volume being an order of magnitude greater on the pollution transport dates. The PM2.5 over central Seoul were significantly greater than for coastal sites on the transboundary transport days yet not on stagnation days, suggesting additional particle formation from gaseous urban emissions in cloud/fog droplets and/or in the high RH humidified aerosol environment. Many days had KORUS-AQ research aircraft flights that provided observations of aerosol absorption, particle chemistry and vertical profiles of extinction. AERONET retrievals and aircraft in situ measurements both showed high single scattering albedo (weak absorption) on the cloudy or cloud influenced days, plus aircraft profile in situ measurements showed large AOD enhancements (versus dried aerosol) at ambient relative humidity (RH) on the pollution transport days, consistent with the significantly larger fine mode particle radii and weak absorption.

Characterization of sputtered hafnium thin films for high quality factor microwave kinetic inductance detectors	SUPERCONDUCTOR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						kinetic inductance detectors; hafnium; sputter deposition; superconducting resonators	STRESS	Hafnium is an elemental superconductor which crystallizes in a hexagonal close packed structure, has a transition temperature T-C similar or equal to 400 mK, and has a high normal state resistivity around 90 mu omega cm. In Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), these properties are advantageous since they allow for creating detectors sensitive to optical and near infra-red radiation. In this work, we study how sputter conditions and especially the power applied to the target during the deposition, affect the hafnium T-C, resistivity, stress, texture and preferred crystal orientation. We find that the position of the target with respect to the substrate strongly affects the orientation of the crystallites in the films and the internal quality factor, Q(i), of MKIDs fabricated from the films. In particular, we demonstrate that a DC magnetron sputter deposition at a normal angle of incidence, low pressure, and low plasma power promotes the growth of compressive (002)-oriented films and that such films can be used to make high quality factor MKIDs with Q(i) up to 600,000.

A filtered and coarsened DNS (FCDNS) field is first created to mimic a real LES field, and the FCDNS values for thermodynamic variables (temperature, density and species mass fractions) are used as inputs to the DCSE model to predict the FCDNS reaction rates. It is found that there are significant errors in the predictions of the filtered reaction rate compared to the template. These errors are attributed to three important aspects of the model. First, the conditional-filtered values of the thermodynamic variables are found by an inversion of an integral equation, but this inversion requires the definition of spatial ensembles in which it must be performed; these ensembles are a subset of the entire spatial domain containing the LES volumes. A drastic reduction in the number of ensembles from the number of LES volumes (i.e. the largest possible number of such ensembles) deteriorates the model, whereas a further and smaller such reduction has a small effect. Second, the procedure for the integral inversion introduces problems related to the method selected to regularize the inversion. Third, by far the largest source of error was found to be due to the modelling of the joint probability density function of the conditioning variables: assuming a beta-PDF for the marginal PDF of the reaction progress variable is shown to be a particularly poor choice, as is the assumption that the conditioning variables are statistically independent.

In this study, we used satellite remote sensing records spanning 31 years to detect SSC changes (SSC prediction r2=0.78, RMSE=21.2 mg/L) due to dam development. We focused on the 3S basin of the MRB. We also used satellite data on nighttime lights, which reflect human settlement patterns, and land cover to explain SSC patterns. Our technique allowed for quantification of SSC changes due to dam construction (e.g., +120 mg/L near basin outlet), reservoir sediment trapping (e.g., -108 mg/L), deforestation, and human settlement (e.g., +117 mg/L near impacts). Our technique also demonstrated how the SSC of the 3S rivers compared to that of the Mekong mainstem over time (e.g., from similar to 13% to 100% greater). Our comprehensive analyses of SSC records with dam development indicate that SSC changes will continue with ongoing dam and landscape development in the MRB. From a hydrologic perspective, SSC monitoring will be imperative for effective sediment and water management. Our satellite-based approach answers critical sediment needs of improved monitoring and adaptive management throughout the MRB and other global locations for practitioners who are engaged in real-world management of their river basins.

Bulk composition of regolith fines on lunar crater floors: Initial investigation by LRO/Mini-RF	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Moon; dielectric properties; ice; regolith	PLANETARY SCIENCE; RADAR PROPERTIES; WATER; MOON; ICE; MISSION	Identifying polarimetric radar signatures of ice in smooth regolith fines on the floors of permanently shadowed lunar craters is hindered by uncertainties in their dielectric properties. We address this deficiency through polarimetric radar analysis of surface backscatter to derive the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)') of smooth, rock-free regolith fines covering brecciated crater floors observed by Mini-RF, which offer ideal locations for unambiguous retrieval of surface epsilon(r)' from linear polarimetric scattering models and CPR analysis for volatile identification. Specifically, we select fines covering crater fills in north polar and equatorial regions to constrain the range of variability of epsilon(r)' as a function of latitude and crater diameter, where we hypothesize that the latter is indicative of the excavation depth of these fines. Our observations suggest that there is measurable variability in the dielectric properties of fines on lunar crater floors as a function of crater size and potentially with impact excavation depth, suggesting that small craters <5-km in diameter have epsilon(r)' ranging from 2.3-to-3, and large ones >5-km have higher values of epsilon(r)' that range from 3-to-3.8. We find that the most plausible explanation for the observed variability of epsilon(r)' of regolith fines on crater floors is mineralogical differences, suggesting an increase in metal abundance in the original excavated substrate with depth, i.e., in the uppermost kilometer of the lunar crust. Finally, we suggest that regolith fines on the floors of permanently shadowed craters <5 km in diameter are optimal targets for the unambiguous detection of water-ice enrichment using S-band radar observations.

High Strength Inflatable Pouch Anchors	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Soft robot applications; grippers and other end-effectors; soft robot materials and design	SOFT; DESIGN; FABRICATION; ROBOT	Anchoring is an important capability for mobile robots to conserve power, survey an area, or deploy a payload. However, the careful placement of an anchor in unstructured environments requires a great deal of dexterity, perception, and planning. Furthermore, many of the reversible adhesives that may be used for anchoring are surface-dependent. We introduce inflatable pouch anchors as a versatile, low-power, and easy-to-position technology for anchoring in natural surfaces. By using negative space such as gaps and cracks with a flexible pouch, the challenge of placing an anchor is greatly simplified. We used a compressed CO$_2$ canister to supply pressure, and a three-way normally-closed valve to allow for multiple uses. We tested the anchor with high friction interfaces such as microspines and gecko-inspired adhesives. We validated the performance with tests on smooth acrylic, sandpaper, manufactured rock, and natural rock. The 425 g anchor actuated at an internal pressure of 105 kPa held over 700 N when anchored in natural rock with a microspine interface.

Understanding the uncertainty associated with this measurement is vital for science predictions and analysis and for water resource management decision making. In this manuscript, the uncertainty in disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange (disALEXI) is quantified; disALEXI is an ET algorithm that utilizes land surface temperature (LST) derived from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), as well ancillary inputs for landcover, elevation, vegetation parameters, and meteorological inputs. Since each of these inputs has an associated, and potentially unknown, uncertainty, in this study a Monte Carlo simulation based on a spatial statistical model is used to determine the algorithm's sensitivity to each of its inputs, and to quantify the probability distribution of algorithm outputs. Analysis shows that algorithm is most sensitive to LST (the input derived from ECOSTRESS). Significantly, the output uncertainty distribution is non-Gaussian, due to the non-linear nature of the algorithm. This means that ET uncertainty cannot be prescribed by accuracy and precision alone. Here, uncertainty was represented using five quantiles of the output distribution. The distribution was consistent across five different datasets (mean offset is 0.01 mm/day, and 95% of the data is contained within 0.3 mm/day). An additional two datasets with low ET, showed higher uncertainty (95% of the data is within 1 mm/day), and a positive bias (i.e., ET was overestimated by an average of 0.12 mm/day when ET was low).

Remotely sensed data may complement field data and thus help to increase the precision of estimates and circumvent some of the problems with missing sample observations in inaccessible areas. Here, we report the results of a study conducted in a 15,867 km(2) area in the dry miombo woodlands of Tanzania, to quantify the contribution of existing canopy height and biomass maps to improving the precision of canopy height and AGB estimates locally. A local and a global height map and three global biomass maps, and a probability sample of 513 inventory plots were subject to analysis. Model-assisted sampling estimators were used to estimate mean height and AGB across the study area using the original maps and then with the maps calibrated with local inventory plots. Large systematic map errors - positive or negative - were found for all the maps, with systematic errors as great as 60-70 %. The maps contributed nothing or even negatively to the precision of mean height and mean AGB estimates. However, after being calibrated locally, the maps contributed substantially to increasing the precision of both mean height and mean AGB estimates, with relative efficiencies (variance of the field-based estimates relative to the variance of the map-assisted estimates) of 1.3-2.7 for the overall estimates. The study, although focused on a relatively small area of dry tropical forests, illustrates the potential strengths and weaknesses of existing global forest height and biomass maps based on remotely sensed data and universal prediction models. Our results suggest that the use of regional or local inventory data for calibration can substantially increase the precision of map-based estimates and their applications in assessing forest carbon stocks for emission reduction programs and policy and financial decisions.

Strong anthropogenic control of secondary organic aerosol formation from isoprene in Beijing	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PEARL RIVER DELTA; IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; CHEMICAL SPECIATION MONITOR; PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; 2013 SOUTHERN OXIDANT; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; REACTIVE UPTAKE; SOA FORMATION; SEASONAL CHARACTERIZATION; 2-METHYLGLYCERIC ACID	Isoprene-derived secondary organic aerosol (iSOA) is a significant contributor to organic carbon (OC) in some forested regions, such as tropical rainforests and the Southeastern US. However, its contribution to organic aerosol in urban areas that have high levels of anthropogenic pollutants is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the formation of anthropogenically influenced iSOA during summer in Beijing, China. Local isoprene emissions and high levels of anthropogenic pollutants, in particular NOx and particulate SO42-, led to the formation of iSOA under both high- and low-NO oxidation conditions, with significant heterogeneous transformations of isoprene-derived oxidation products to particulate organosulfates (OSs) and nitrooxy-organosulfates (NOSs). Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry was combined with a rapid automated data processing technique to quantify 31 proposed iSOA tracers in offline PM2.5 filter extracts. The co-elution of the inorganic ions in the extracts caused matrix effects that impacted two authentic standards differently. The average concentration of iSOA OSs and NOSs was 82.5 ng m(-3), which was around 3 times higher than the observed concentrations of their oxygenated precursors (2-methyltetrols and 2-methylglyceric acid). OS formation was dependant on both photochemistry and the sulfate available for reactive uptake, as shown by a strong correlation with the product of ozone (O-3) and particulate sulfate (SO42-). A greater proportion of high-NO OS products were observed in Beijing compared with previous studies in less polluted environments. The iSOA-derived OSs and NOSs represented 0.62% of the oxidized organic aerosol measured by aerosol mass spectrometry on average, but this increased to similar to 3% on certain days. These results indicate for the first time that iSOA formation in urban Beijing is strongly controlled by anthropogenic emissions and results in extensive conversion to OS products from heterogenous reactions.

Asteroid (16) Psyche's primordial shape: A possible Jacobi ellipsoid	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						minor planets; asteroids: general; minor planets; asteroids: individual: (16) Psyche; methods: observational; techniques: high angular resolution	DENSITY	Context. Asteroid (16) Psyche is the largest M-type asteroid in the main belt and the target of the NASA Psyche mission. It is also the only asteroid of this size (D> 200 km) known to be metal rich. Although various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the rather unique physical properties of this asteroid, a perfect understanding of its formation and bulk composition is still missing.Aims. We aim to refine the shape and bulk density of (16) Psyche and to perform a thorough analysis of its shape to better constrain possible formation scenarios and the structure of its interior.Methods. We obtained disk-resolved VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL images acquired within our ESO large program (ID 199.C-0074), which complement similar data obtained in 2018. Both data sets offer a complete coverage of Psyche's surface. These images were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) shape of Psyche with two independent shape modeling algorithms (MPCD and ADAM). A shape analysis was subsequently performed, including a comparison with equilibrium figures and the identification of mass deficit regions.Results. Our 3D shape along with existing mass estimates imply a density of 4.20 0.60 g cm(-3), which is so far the highest for a solar system object following the four telluric planets. Furthermore, the shape of Psyche presents small deviations from an ellipsoid, that is, prominently three large depressions along its equator. The flatness and density of Psyche are compatible with a formation at hydrostatic equilibrium as a Jacobi ellipsoid with a shorter rotation period of similar to 3h. Later impacts may have slowed down Psyche's rotation, which is currently similar to 4.2 h, while also creating the imaged depressions.Conclusions. Our results open the possibility that Psyche acquired its primordial shape either after a giant impact while its interior was already frozen or while its interior was still molten owing to the decay of the short-lived radionuclide Al-26.

Decay of the Snow Cover Over Arctic Sea Ice From ICESat-2 Acquisitions During Summer Melt in 2019	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							SEASONAL EVOLUTION; MODEL; DEPTH	From the onset of melt in early June, corresponding declines in Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) freeboard and surface albedo can be seen over the entire Arctic sea ice cover. In the 2019 summer, area-averaged freeboard decreased from 34 cm prior to melt to a minimum of 12 cm in August while the area-averaged albedo decreased from similar to 0.7 to 0.38 for the same period. Calculations using ICESat-2 freeboards and modeled ice thickness from Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) give area-averaged snow depths ranging from 17 cm prior to melt to 3 cm in August over seasonal ice and from 34 to 4 cm over multiyear ice. Mean rates of snow ablation (including evaporation) in mid-June were as high as 2 cm/day, comparable to field records from other years. Increases in freeboard after mid-August in the high latitude (>80 degrees N) multiyear ice cover, north of the Greenland coast, are likely due to earlier freeze-up and snow accumulation in these regions with shorter melt seasons. Plain Language Summary As the air temperature warms with the onset of summer, the Arctic Ocean ice cover undergoes its annual transformation from a highly reflective snow-covered surface in winter to a darker, more absorbent surface during summer composed of bare ice, melt ponds, and open water. Several weeks after the onset of melt, much of the snow layer disappears as the snow is converted into meltwater. Over the entire ice cover, this loss of the snow layer can be seen in the lowering of surface heights measured by the lidar on NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). In this paper, we describe the changes in surface height and the corresponding changes in snow depth from the satellite observations and compare them with existing measurements from field programs, which are limited due to challenging logistics during the summer. We show, for the first time, that we can observe corresponding changes in surface height and reflectivity as well as the different rates of melt in the decay of the snow cover. These results will allow for an improved understanding of the impact of the snow layer on the fate of the ice cover at the end of the summer.	[Kwok, R.; Cunningham, G.

The GRACE-FO instrument and flight system performance has improved over GRACE. Better attitude solutions and enhanced pointing performance result in reduced fuel consumption and gravity range rate post-fit residuals. One accelerometer requires additional calibrations due to unexpected measurement noise. The GRACE-FO gravity and mass change fields from June 2018 through December 2019 continue the GRACE record at an equivalent precision and spatiotemporal sampling. During this period, GRACE-FO observed large interannual terrestrial water variations associated with excess rainfall (Central US, Middle East), drought (Europe, Australia), and ice melt (Greenland). These observations are consistent with independent mass change estimates, providing high confidence that no intermission biases exist from GRACE to GRACE-FO, despite the 11-month gap. GRACE-FO has also successfully demonstrated satellite-to-satellite laser ranging interferometry. Plain Language Summary Mass change is a fundamental climate system indicator and provides an integrated global view of how Earth's water cycle and energy balance are evolving. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission monitored mass changes every month from 2002 through 2017. Since June 2018, GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) continues this data record, tracking and monitoring changes in ice sheets and glaciers, near-surface and underground water storage, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents. GRACE-FO instruments have been successfully calibrated and are providing new monthly mass change observations at a consistent spatial resolution and data quality with GRACE. Since its launch, GRACE-FO has measured record land water storage changes in 2018 and 2019 in response to extreme heat waves and droughts over Europe and Australia, as well as to extreme rainfall events over the United States and Middle East. In the summer of 2019, GRACE-FO measured record-level Greenland mass loss rates. A novel laser ranging interferometer was successfully demonstrated on GRACE-FO, laying the groundwork for improved future satellite gravity observations.

Inelastic scattering dynamics of naphthalene and 2-octanone on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-SURFACE SCATTERING; MOLECULAR-BEAM; VIBRATIONAL-EXCITATION; LIQUID SURFACES; COSINE LAW; MODEL; ENERGY; DISTRIBUTIONS; DESORPTION; DEPENDENCE	The inelastic scattering dynamics of the isobaric molecules, naphthalene (C10H8) and 2-octanone (C8H16O), on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) have been investigated as part of a broader effort to inform the inlet design of a mass spectrometer for the analysis of atmospheric gases during a flyby mission through the atmosphere of a planet or moon. Molecular beam-surface scattering experiments were conducted, and the scattered products were detected with the use of a rotatable mass spectrometer detector. Continuous, supersonic beams were prepared, with average incident translational energies, E-i, of 247.3 kJ mol(-1) and 538.2 kJ mol(-1) for naphthalene and 268.6 kJ mol(-1) and 433.8 kJ mol(-1) for 2-octanone. These beams were directed toward an HOPG surface, held at 530 K, at incident angles, theta (i), of 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 70 degrees, and scattered products were detected as functions of their translational energies and scattering angles. The scattering dynamics of both molecules are very similar and mimic the scattering of atoms and small molecules on rough surfaces, where parallel momentum is not conserved, suggesting that the dynamics are dominated by a corrugated interaction potential between the incident molecule and the surface. The effective corrugation of the molecule-surface interaction is apparently caused by the structure of the incident molecule and the consequent myriad available energy transfer pathways between the molecule and the surface during a complex collision event. In addition, the HOPG surface contributes to the corrugation of the interaction potential because it can absorb significant energy from collisions with incident molecules that have high mass and incident energy. Small differences in the scattering dynamics of the two molecules are inferred to arise from the details of the molecule-surface interaction potential, with 2-octanone exhibiting dynamics that suggest a slightly stronger interaction with the surface than naphthalene. These results add to a growing body of work on the scattering dynamics of organic molecules on HOPG, from which insight into the hypervelocity sampling and analysis of such molecules may be obtained.

Euclid: Reconstruction of weak-lensing mass maps for non-Gaussianity studies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; methods: data analysis; dark matter	DARK-MATTER; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; PEAK STATISTICS; COSMIC SHEAR; INVERSION; UNIVERSE; HALO	Weak lensing, which is the deflection of light by matter along the line of sight, has proven to be an efficient method for constraining models of structure formation and reveal the nature of dark energy. So far, most weak-lensing studies have focused on the shear field that can be measured directly from the ellipticity of background galaxies. However, within the context of forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid, convergence maps (mass maps) offer an important advantage over shear fields in terms of cosmological exploitation. While it carry the same information, the lensing signal is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear field. This simplifies otherwise computationally expensive analyses, for instance, non-Gaussianity studies. However, the inversion of the non-local shear field requires accurate control of systematic effects caused by holes in the data field, field borders, shape noise, and the fact that the shear is not a direct observable (reduced shear). We present the two mass-inversion methods that are included in the official Euclid data-processing pipeline: the standard Kaiser & Squires method (KS), and a new mass-inversion method (KS+) that aims to reduce the information loss during the mass inversion. This new method is based on the KS method and includes corrections for mass-mapping systematic effects. The results of the KS+ method are compared to the original implementation of the KS method in its simplest form, using the Euclid Flagship mock galaxy catalogue. In particular, we estimate the quality of the reconstruction by comparing the two-point correlation functions and third- and fourth-order moments obtained from shear and convergence maps, and we analyse each systematic effect independently and simultaneously. We show that the KS+ method substantially reduces the errors on the two-point correlation function and moments compared to the KS method. In particular, we show that the errors introduced by the mass inversion on the two-point correlation of the convergence maps are reduced by a factor of about 5, while the errors on the third- and fourth-order moments are reduced by factors of about 2 and 10, respectively.

Candidate Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Binary Black Hole Merger Gravitational-Wave Event S190521g	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							AGN DISCS; TIDAL DISRUPTION; MASS; VARIABILITY; PREDICTIONS; RADIATION	We report the first plausible optical electromagnetic counterpart to a (candidate) binary black hole merger. Detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility, the electromagnetic flare is consistent with expectations for a kicked binary black hole merger in the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus [B. McKernan, K. E. S. Ford, I. Bartos et aL, Astrophys. J. Lett. 884, L50 (2019)] and is unlikely [< O(0.01%))] due to intrinsic variability of this source. The lack of color evolution implies that it is not a supernova and instead is strongly suggestive of a constant temperature shock. Other false-positive events, such as microlensing or a tidal disruption event, are ruled out or constrained to be < 0(0.1%). If the flare is associated with S190521g, we find plausible values of total mass M-BBH similar to 100 M-circle dot, kick velocity v(k) similar to 200 km s(-1) at theta similar to 60 degrees in a disk with aspect ratio H/a similar to 0.01 (i.e., disk height H at radius a) and gas density rho similar to 10(-10)g cm(-3). The merger could have occurred at a disk migration trap (a similar to 700r(g); r(g) (math) GM(SMBH)/c(2), where M-SMBH the mass of the active galactic nucleus supermassive black hole). The combination of parameters implies a significant spin for at least one of the black holes in S190521g. The timing of our spectroscopy prevents useful constraints on broad-line asymmetry due to an off-center flare. We predict a repeat flare in this source due to a reencountering with the disk in similar to 1.6 yr(M-SMBH/10(8) M-circle dot)(a/10(3) r(g))(3/2) .	[Graham, M. J.; Burdge, K.; Djorgovski, S.

Macroscopic Versus Microscopic Schottky Barrier Determination at (Au/Pt)/Ge(100): Interfacial Local Modulation	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						ballistic transport; Schottky barrier; ballistic electron emission spectroscopy; Green's functions methods; density functional theory; gold (Au); platinum (Pt); germanium (Ge)	ELECTRON-EMISSION MICROSCOPY; GERMANIUM PHOTODETECTOR; SILICON; SPECTROSCOPY; PASSIVATION; SURFACE	Macroscopic current-voltage measurements and nanoscopic ballistic electron emission spectroscopy (BEES) have been used to probe the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at metal/Ge(100) junctions for two metal electrodes (Au and Pt) and different metallization methods, specifically, thermal-vapor and laser-vapor deposition. Analysis of macroscopic current-voltage characteristics indicates that a SBH of 0.61-0.63 eV controls rectification at room temperature. On the other hand, BEES measured at 80 K reveals the coexistence of two distinct barriers at the nanoscale, taking values in the ranges 0.61-0.64 and 0.70-0.74 eV for the cases studied. For each metal-semiconductor junction, the macroscopic measurement agrees well with the lower barrier found with BEES. Ab initio modeling of BEES spectra ascribes the two barriers to two different atomic registries between the metals and the Ge(100) surface, a significant relevant insight for next-generation highly miniaturized Ge-based devices.

Steven; Fasullo, John T.; Cheon, Se-Hyeon			Origin of interannual variability in global mean sea level	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						sea level; climate variability; global mean sea level; satellite altimetry	LA-NINA; RISE; TRENDS	The two dominant drivers of the global mean sea level (GMSL) variability at interannual timescales are steric changes due to changes in ocean heat content and barystatic changes due to the exchange of water mass between land and ocean. With Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and Argo profiling floats, it has been possible to measure the relative steric and barystatic contributions to GMSL since 2004. While efforts to "close the GMSL budget" with satellite altimetry and other observing systems have been largely successful with regards to trends, the short time period covered by these records prohibits a full understanding of the drivers of interannual to decadal variability in GMSL. One particular area of focus is the link between variations in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and GMSL. Recent literature disagrees on the relative importance of steric and barystatic contributions to interannual to decadal variability in GMSL. Here, we use a multivariate data analysis technique to estimate variability in barystatic and steric contributions to GMSL back to 1982. These independent estimates explain most of the observed interannual variability in satellite altimeter-measured GMSL. Both processes, which are highly correlated with ENSO variations, contribute about equally to observed interannual GMSL variability. A theoretical scaling analysis corroborates the observational results. The improved understanding of the origins of interannual variability in GMSL has important implications for our understanding of long-term trends in sea level, the hydrological cycle, and the planet's radiation imbalance.

These studies were motivated by a desire to understand the ability of resilient forms of life to survive under such conditions as a proxy for potential endogenic life and to inform planetary protection protocols for future missions. To accomplish this, we irradiatedBacillus subtilisspores with solar-like UV photons at temperatures ranging from room temperature down to 11 K and reported survival fractions with respect to fluence. We observed an increase in survival at low temperatures and found that the inactivation rate follows an Arrhenius-type behavior above 60 K. For solar-photon fluxes and surface temperatures at Europa and Enceladus, we found thatBacillus subtilisspores would be inactivated in less than an hour when in direct sunlight.

Currently, the GRACE-FO satellites are the sole dedicated provider of these data, while previously the GRACE mission fulfilled that role for 15 years. There is a data gap spanning from July 2017 to May 2018 between the end of the GRACE mission and start the of GRACE-FO, while the Swarm satellites have collected gravimetric data with their GPS receivers since December 2013. We present high-quality gravity field models (GFMs) from Swarm data that constitute an alternative and independent source of gravimetric data, which could help alleviate the consequences of the 10-month gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO, as well as the short gaps in the existing GRACE and GRACE-FO monthly time series. The geodetic community has realized that the combination of different gravity field solutions is superior to any individual model and set up the Combination Service of Time-variable Gravity Fields (COST-G) under the umbrella of the International Gravity Field Service (IGFS), part of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). We exploit this fact and deliver the highest-quality monthly GFMs, resulting from the combination of four different gravity field estimation approaches. All solutions are unconstrained and estimated independently from month to month. We tested the added value of including kinematic baselines (KBs) in our estimation of GFMs and conclude that there is no significant improvement. The non-gravitational accelerations measured by the accelerometer on board Swarm C were also included in our processing to determine if this would improve the quality of the GFMs, but we observed that is only the case when the amplitude of the non-gravitational accelerations is higher than during the current quiet period in solar activity. Using GRACE data for comparison, we demonstrate that the geophysical signal in the Swarm GFMs is largely restricted to spherical harmonic degrees below 12. A 750 km smoothing radius is suitable to retrieve the temporal variations in Earth's gravity field over land areas since mid-2015 with roughly 4 cm equivalent water height (EWH) agreement with respect to GRACE. Over ocean areas, we illustrate that a more intense smoothing with 3000 km radius is necessary to resolve large-scale gravity variations, which agree with GRACE roughly at the level of 1 cm EWH, while at these spatial scales the GRACE observes variations with amplitudes between 0.3 and 1 cm EWH. The agreement with GRACE and GRACE-FO over nine selected large basins under analysis is 0.91 cm, 0.76 cm yr(-1), and 0.79 in terms of temporal mean, trend, and correlation coefficient, respectively. The Swarm monthly models are distributed on a quarterly basis at ESA's Earth Swarm Data Access (at https://swarm-diss.eo.esa.int/, last access: 5 June 2020, follow Level2longterm and then EGF) and at the International Centre for Global Earth Models (http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/series/02_COST-G/Swarm, last access: 5 June 2020), as well as identified with the DOI https://doi.org/10.5880/ICGEM.2019.006 (Encarnacao et al., 2019).

Utilizing a small cohort of volunteers from a nearby community college as student mentors and one faculty member, 12 visits were conducted throughout the school year. The mentors led science activities, made connections to their collegiate coursework in science, and worked to establish mentor relationships with students in order to motivate them to pursue science upon high school completion. As a result, survey data from the beginning compared to the end of the academic year showed increases in favorable perception of science by as much as 25%. This is most pronounced in young female students of color and by students whose parents have a high school education or lower.

InSight has primary science objectives that are aimed at understanding more about the interior of Mars and the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets. As with previous Mars missions, InSight was obligated to satisfy bioburden requirements and verify compliance with international treaty obligations and National Aeronautics and Space Administration requirements before launch. InSight implemented a series of policies and procedures to minimize biological risk and comply with all applicable requirements for a Planetary Protection Category IVa mission. At launch, InSight had an estimated total bacterial spore burden of 1.50 x 10(5)spores on the entire spacecraft, including the cruise stage, satisfying the requirement of 5 x 10(5)spores. The landed hardware components required <3 x 10(5)spores and a bioburden density of <300 spore/m(2). At launch, the landed hardware of InSight contained an estimated total spore bioburden of 1.35 x 10(5)spores and an estimated bioburden density of 129 spores/m(2).

Multiple Stable Isoprene-Ozone Complexes Reveal Complex Entrance Channel Dynamics in the Isoprene plus Ozone Reaction	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							DER-WAALS COMPLEXES; GAS-PHASE REACTIONS; MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; MICROWAVE-SPECTRUM; ORGANIC AEROSOLS; OH FORMATION; BASIS-SETS; OZONOLYSIS; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM	Accurately characterizing isoprene ozonolysis continues to challenge atmospheric chemists. The reaction is believed to be a spontaneous, concerted cycloaddition. However, little information is available about the entrance channel and isoprene-ozone complexes thought to define the longrange portion of the reaction coordinate. Our coupled cluster and auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo calculations predict multiple stable isoprene-ozone van der Waals complexes for trans-isoprene in the gas phase with moderate association energies. These results indicate that long-range dynamics in the isoprene-ozone entrance channel can impact the overall reaction in the troposphere and provide the spectroscopic information necessary to extend the microwave characterization of isoprene ozonolysis to prereactive complexes. At the air - water interface, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the cycloaddition reaction between ozone and trans-isoprene follows a stepwise mechanism, which is quite distinct from our proposed gas- phase mechanism and occurs on a femtosecond time scale. The stepwise nature of isoprene ozonolysis on the aqueous surface is more consistent with the DeMore mechanism than with the Criegee mechanism suggested by the gas-phase calculations, suggesting that the reaction media may play an important role in the reaction. Overall, these predictions aim to provide a missing fundamental piece of molecular insight into isoprene ozonolysis, which has broad tropospheric implications due to its critical role as a nighttime source of hydroxyl radicals.

Aeolian abrasion of surface rocks has been documented by most missions that have landed on Mars, but attention has largely focused on relatively resistant rocks that display ventifact morphologies well-known from Earth. The current study instead emphasizes abrasion features developed on mudstone surfaces, because aeolian abrasion textures are very common in the mudstone-dominated Murray Formation at Gale Crater. These abrasion textures have been observed over a wide area, and they allow deductions about dominant past wind regimes that differ from those observed at present. On Earth, aeolian abrasion features in mudstone outcrops have minimal preservation potential because of the susceptibility of mudstones to moisture and aqueous erosion, even in dominantly arid surface environments. Because of this there is no literature on potential terrestrial analogs. In order to better understand aeolian abrasion morphologies in mudstones on Mars, laboratory experiments were conducted that exposed a range of mudstone samples and rock simulant samples to wind-driven sand for periods of up to four months. These experiments produced a range of aeolian abrasion textures ('wind tails', fluting, differential 'etching' of laminae, stalks and pedestals) that can serve as analogs for features in the Murray Formation, increasing our confidence regarding aeolian origins for these and the deductions of formative, sand-driving wind azimuths. Orientations of aeolian abrasion textures along the Mars Science Laboratory traverse were compared with active ripple orientations in rover images, and with previous analyses of orbital images of the study area, in order to evaluate whether the current, complex wind environment can explain the abrasion orientations observed in rover images, or if the abrasion record might also contain signatures of past wind regimes that differed from those of the present. Results show relatively coherent patterns of airflow and sand movement that vary in accordance with factors like local topography and upwind availability of sand for abrasion. Wind events blowing southwest that are primarily responsible for southwest migration of the Bagnold Dunes have also caused bedrock abrasion of similar orientation between these dunes. Less effective wind events (from an abrasion standpoint) blowing south-southeast have broadly affected bedrock exposures elsewhere across the Mars Science Laboratory landing site away from the Bagnold Dunes. A notable exception are northeast abrasion textures on the more erosion-resistant sandstones of the Naukluft Plateau. The latter are consistent with one of two abrasion directions measured in previous studies, prior to the rover's arrival at the Murray Formation mudstones, and probably reflect the preservation of an ancient sand-driving wind regime that differs from that of the present.

GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION; COUPLED EQUATORIAL WAVES; VERTICAL STRUCTURE; MOISTURE MODES; PRECIPITATION; TRACKING; TROPICS; BIAS	Many climate models struggle with a poor simulation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), especially its propagation across the Maritime Continent (MC). This study quantitatively evaluates the robustness of MJO propagation over the MC in climate models that participated in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Phase 6 (CMIP6) with a newly developed MC propagation metric. The results show that the CMIP6 models simulate MJO propagation over the MC more realistically than the CMIP5 models. Lower free-tropospheric moisture budget analysis highlights that the greater horizontal moisture advection is responsible for the enhanced MJO propagation over the MC. The increase in horizontal moisture advection in the CMIP6 models is mainly attributed to the steeper horizontal mean state moisture gradient around the MC, which is associated with the reduction of the equatorial dry bias.

The root of anomalously specular reflections from solid surfaces on Saturn's moon Titan	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CASSINI RADAR	Saturn's moon Titan has a methane cycle with clouds, rain, rivers, lakes, and seas; it is the only world known to presently have a volatile cycle akin to Earth's tropospheric water cycle. Anomalously specular radar reflections (ASRR) from Titan's tropical region were observed with the Arecibo Observatory (AO) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and interpreted as evidence for liquid surfaces. The Cassini spacecraft discovered lakes/seas on Titan, however, it did not observe lakes/seas at the AO/GBT anomalously specular locations. A satisfactory explanation for the ASRR has been elusive for more than a decade. Here we show that the ASRR originate from one terrain unit, likely paleolakes/paleoseas. Titan observations provide ground-truth in the search for oceans on exoearths and an important lesson is that identifying liquid surfaces by specular reflections requires a stringent definition of specular; we propose a definition for this purpose. Anomalously specular radar reflections (ASRR) from Titan's tropical region were interpreted earlier as evidence for liquid surfaces, but the Cassini spacecraft did not observe lakes/seas at the anomalously specular locations. Here, the authors show that ASRR originate from one terrain unit, likely paleolakes/paleoseas.

Vertical Transport, Entrainment, and Scavenging Processes Affecting Trace Gases in a Modeled and Observed SEAC(4)RS Case Study	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							UPPER TROPOSPHERE; CONVECTIVE INJECTION; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; DEEP CONVECTION; FAST-RESPONSE; CHEMISTRY; FORMALDEHYDE; ISOPRENE; RETENTION; OZONE	The convectively driven transport of soluble trace gases from the lower to the upper troposphere can occur on timescales of less than an hour, and recent studies suggest that microphysical scavenging is the dominant removal process of tropospheric ozone precursors. We examine the processes responsible for vertical transport, entrainment, and scavenging of soluble ozone precursors (formaldehyde and peroxides) for midlatitude convective storms sampled on 2 September 2013 during the Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC(4)RS) study. Cloud-resolving simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model combined with aircraft measurements were performed to understand the effect of entrainment, scavenging efficiency (SE), and ice physics processes on these trace gases. Analysis of the observations revealed that the SEs of formaldehyde (43-53%) and hydrogen peroxide (similar to 80-90%) were consistent between SEAC(4)RS storms and the severe convection observed during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry Experiment (DC3) campaign. However, methyl hydrogen peroxide SE was generally smaller in the SEAC(4)RS storms (4%-27%) compared to DC3 convection. Predicted ice retention factors exhibit different values for some species compared to DC3, and we attribute these differences to variations in net precipitation production. The analyses show that much larger production of precipitation between condensation and freezing levels for DC3 severe convection compared to smaller SEAC(4)RS storms is largely responsible for the lower amount of soluble gases transported to colder temperatures, reducing the amount of soluble gases which eventually interact with cloud ice particles.

The first 2 years of SAGE III/ISS (v5.1) solar occultation ozone data were evaluated by using correlative satellite and ground-based measurements. Among the three (MES, AO3, and MLR) SAGE III/ISS retrieved solar ozone products, AO3 ozone shows the smallest bias and best precision, with mean biases less than 5% for altitudes similar to 15-55 km in the midlatitudes and similar to 20-55 km in the tropics. In the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, AO3 ozone shows high biases that increase with decreasing altitudes and reach similar to 10% near the tropopause. Preliminary studies indicate that those high biases primarily result from the contributions of the oxygen dimer (O-4) not being appropriately removed within the ozone channel. The precision of AO3 ozone is estimated to be similar to 3% for altitudes between 20 and 40 km. It degrades to similar to 10-15% in the lower mesosphere (similar to 55 km) and similar to 20-30% near the tropopause. There could be an altitude registration error of similar to 100 m in the SAGE III/ISS auxiliary temperature and pressure profiles. This, however, does not affect retrieved ozone profiles in native number density on geometric altitude coordinates. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (similar to 40-55 km), the SAGE III/ISS (and SAGE II) retrieved ozone values show sunrise/sunset differences of similar to 5-8%, which are almost twice as large as what was observed by other satellites or model predictions. This feature needs further study.	[Wang, H. J.

There is a need for systems that can rapidly and intelligently extract information from planetary instrument datasets and focus attention on the most promising or novel observations. Several novelty detection methods have been explored in prior work for three-channel color images and non-image datasets, but few have considered multispectral or hyperspectral image datasets for the purpose of scientific discovery. We compared the performance of four novelty detection methods-Reed Xiaoli (RX) detectors, principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)-and the ability of each method to provide explanatory visualizations to help scientists understand and trust predictions made by the system. We show that pixel-wise RX and autoencoders trained with structural similarity (SSIM) loss can detect morphological novelties that are not detected by PCA, GANs, and mean squared error autoencoders, but that the latter methods are better suited for detecting spectral novelties-i.e., the best method for a given setting depends on the type of novelties that are sought. Additionally, we find that autoencoders provide the most useful explanatory visualizations for enabling users to understand and trust model detections, and that existing GAN approaches to novelty detection may be limited in this respect.

The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) provides a catalog of high-redshift (0.7 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 1.5) infrared-selected galaxy clusters. However, the verification of the ionized intracluster medium, indicative of a collapsed and nearly virialized system, is made challenging by the high redshifts of the sample members.Aims. The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA; also known as the Morita Array) Band 3 observations, centered at about 97.5 GHz, to provide robust validation of cluster detections via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect.Methods. Using a pilot sample that comprises ten MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, accessible to ACA and representative of the median sample richness, we infer the masses of the selected galaxy clusters and respective detection significance by means of a Bayesian analysis of the interferometric data.Results. Our test of the Verification with the ACA - Localization and Cluster Analysis (VACA LoCA) program demonstrates that the ACA can robustly confirm the presence of the virialized intracluster medium in galaxy clusters previously identified in full-sky surveys. In particular, we obtain a significant detection of the SZ effect for seven out of the ten VACA LoCA clusters. We note that this result is independent of the assumed pressure profile. However, the limited angular dynamic range of the ACA in Band 3 alone, short observational integration times, and possible contamination from unresolved sources limit the detailed characterization of the cluster properties and the inference of the cluster masses within scales appropriate for the robust calibration of mass-richness scaling relations.

We focus here on trends between 2000 and 2018. All data sets show similar results, although some discrepancies are observed. In the upper stratosphere, the trends are positive throughout all seasons and the majority of latitudes. The largest upper-stratospheric ozone trends are observed during local winter (up to 6 % per decade) and equinox (up to 3 % per decade) at mid-latitudes. In the equatorial region, we find a very strong seasonal dependence of ozone trends at all altitudes: the trends vary from positive to negative, with the sign of transition depending on altitude and season. The trends are negative in the upper-stratospheric winter ( - 1 % per decade to -2 % per decade) and in the lower-stratospheric spring (-2 % per decade to -4 % per decade), but positive (2 % per decade to 3 % per decade) at 30-35 km in spring, while the opposite pattern is observed in summer. The tropical trends below 25 km are negative and maximize during summer (up to -2 % per decade) and spring (up to -3 % per decade). In the lower mid-latitude stratosphere, our analysis points to a hemispheric asymmetry: during local summers and equinoxes, positive trends are observed in the south (+1 % per decade to +2 % per decade), while negative trends are observed in the north (-1 % per decade to -2 % per decade). We compare the seasonal dependence of ozone trends with available analyses of the seasonal dependence of stratospheric temperature trends. We find that ozone and temperature trends show positive correlation in the dynamically controlled lower stratosphere and negative correlation above 30 km, where photochemistry dominates. Seasonal trend analysis gives information beyond that contained in annual mean trends, which can be helpful in order to better understand the role of dynamical variability in short-term trends and future ozone recovery predictions.

Likewise, uncertainty in how these traits map to Earth system feedbacks is large. We use a vegetation demographic model (VDM), the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES), to explore parameter sensitivity of model predictions, and comparison to observations, at a tropical forest site: Barro Colorado Island in Panama. We define a single 12-dimensional distribution of plant trait variation, derived primarily from observations in Panama, and define plant functional types (PFTs) as random draws from this distribution. We compare several model ensembles, where individual ensemble members vary only in the plant traits that define PFTs, and separate ensembles differ from each other based on either model structural assumptions or non-trait, ecosystem-level parameters, which include (a) the number of competing PFTs present in any simulation and (b) parameters that govern disturbance and height-based light competition. While single-PFT simulations are roughly consistent with observations of productivity at Barro Colorado Island, increasing the number of competing PFTs strongly shifts model predictions towards higher productivity and biomass forests. Different ecosystem variables show greater sensitivity than others to the number of competing PFTs, with the predictions that are most dominated by large trees, such as biomass, being the most sensitive. Changing disturbance and height-sorting parameters, i.e., the rules of competitive trait filtering, shifts regimes of dominance or coexistence between early- and late-successional PFTs in the model. Increases to the extent or severity of disturbance, or to the degree of determinism in height-based light competition, all act to shift the community towards early-successional PFTs. In turn, these shifts in competitive outcomes alter predictions of ecosystem states and fluxes, with more early-successional-dominated forests having lower biomass. It is thus crucial to differentiate between plant traits, which are under competitive pressure in VDMs, from those model parameters that are not and to better understand the relationships between these two types of model parameters to quantify sources of uncertainty in VDMs.	[Koyen, Charles D.; Knox, Ryan G.; Chambers, Jeffrey Q.; Faybishenko, Boris; Holm, Jennifer; Kueppers, Lara M.; Lemieux, Gregory; Needham, Jessica F.; Powell, Thomas; Varadharajan, Charuleka] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fisher, Rosie A.; Shuman, Jacquelyn K.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Div, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Fisher, Rosie A.] Ctr Europeen Rech & Format Avancee Calcul Sci, Toulouse, France; [Chambers, Jeffrey Q.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Christoffersen, Bradley O.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Biol, Edinburg, TX USA; [Davies, Stuart J.; Muller-Landau, Helene C.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Forest Global Earth Observ, Washington, DC USA; [Detto, Matteo; Muller-Landau, Helene C.; Wright, S.

In these situations, governance, markets and other decision-making structures-together with population exposure and vulnerability-create nonphysical interconnections among events by linking their impacts, to positive or negative effect. Various anthropogenic actions can also directly affect the severity of events, further complicating these feedback loops. Such relationships are rarely characterized or considered in physical-sciences-based research contexts. Here, we present a multidisciplinary argument for the concept of connected extreme events, and we suggest vantage points and approaches for producing climate information useful in guiding decisions about them. The impacts of extreme weather and climate can be amplified by physical interactions among events and across a complex set of societal factors. This Perspective discusses the concept and challenge of connected extreme events, exploring research approaches and decision-making strategies.

We provide unified estimates of grounded and floating ice mass change from 2003 to 2019 using NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 satellite laser altimetry. Our data reveal patterns likely linked to competing climate processes: Ice loss from coastal Greenland (increased surface melt), Antarctic ice shelves (increased ocean melting), and Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers (dynamic response to ocean melting) was partially compensated by mass gains over ice sheet interiors (increased snow accumulation). Losses outpaced gains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 billion tonnes per year) and Antarctica (118 billion tonnes per year) contributing 14 millimeters to sea level. Mass lost from West Antarctica's ice shelves accounted for more than 30% of that region's total.

Photonic Readout of Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Counting Detectors	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							HIGH-EFFICIENCY	Scalable, low power, high speed data transfer between cryogenic (0.1-4K) and room temperature environments is essential for the realization of practical, large-scale systems based on superconducting technologies. A promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional wire-based readout is the use of optical fiber communication. Optical fiber presents a 100-1,000x lower heat load than conventional electrical wiring, relaxing the requirements for thermal anchoring, and is also immune to electromagnetic interference, which allows routing of sensitive signals with improved robustness to noise and crosstalk. Most importantly, optical fibers allow for very high bandwidth densities (in the Tbps/mm(2) range) by carrying multiple signals through the same physical fiber (Wavelength Division Multiplexing, WDM). Here, we demonstrate for the first time optical readout of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) directly coupled to a CMOS photonic modulator, without the need for an interfacing device. By operating the modulator in the forward bias regime at a temperature of 3.6K, we achieve very high modulation efficiency (1,000-10,000pm/V) and a low input impedance of 500 Omega with a low power dissipation of 40 mu W. This allows us to obtain optical modulation with the low, millivolt-level signal generated by the SNSPD.

Observation of Bose-Einstein condensates in an Earth-orbiting research lab	NATURE			English	Article								Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic world, where low mass and momentum reveal a natural wave-particle duality. Magnifying quantum behaviour to macroscopic scales is a major strength of the technique of cooling and trapping atomic gases, in which low momentum is engineered through extremely low temperatures. Advances in this field have achieved such precise control over atomic systems that gravity, often negligible when considering individual atoms, has emerged as a substantial obstacle. In particular, although weaker trapping fields would allow access to lower temperatures(1,2), gravity empties atom traps that are too weak. Additionally, inertial sensors based on cold atoms could reach better sensitivities if the free-fall time of the atoms after release from the trap could be made longer(3). Planetary orbit, specifically the condition of perpetual free-fall, offers to lift cold-atom studies beyond such terrestrial limitations. Here we report production of rubidium Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in an Earth-orbiting research laboratory, the Cold Atom Lab. We observe subnanokelvin BECs in weak trapping potentials with free-expansion times extending beyond one second, providing an initial demonstration of the advantages offered by a microgravity environment for cold-atom experiments and verifying the successful operation of this facility. With routine BEC production, continuing operations will support long-term investigations of trap topologies unique to microgravity(4,5), atom-laser sources(6), few-body physics(7,8)and pathfinding techniques for atom-wave interferometry(9-12).

Measurements at 355 and 532 nm conducted by these two lidars revealed a color ratio of 0.5 for background aerosols and small volcanic plumes and 0.8 for a PyroCb plume recorded on September 2017. Measurements of the Nabro plume by the JPL lidar in 2011-2012 showed a lidar ratio of (64 +/- 12.7) sr at 355 nm around the center of the plume. The new Global Space-based Stratospheric Aerosol Climatology (G1oSSAC), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Level 3 and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III-ISS) stratospheric aerosol datasets were compared to the ground-based lidar datasets. The intercomparison revealed a generally good agreement, with vertical profiles of extinction coefficient within 50 % discrepancy between 17 and 23 km above sea level (a.s.l.) and 25 % above 23 km a.s.l. The stratospheric aerosol depth derived from all of these datasets shows good agreement, with the largest discrepancy (20 %) being observed between the new CALIOP Level 3 and the other datasets. All datasets consistently reveal a relatively quiescent period between 1999 and 2006, followed by an active period of multiple eruptions (e.g., Nabro) until early 2012. Another quiescent period, with slightly higher aerosol background, lasted until mid-2017, when a combination of exten- sive wildfires and multiple volcanic eruptions caused a significant increase in stratospheric aerosol loading. This loading maximized at the very end of the time period considered (fall 2019) as a result of the Raikoke eruption, the plume of which ascended to 26 km altitude in less than 3 months.

To assess the ranging performance of the proposed lidar, a comparative experiment of the multi-tone continuous wave and time-of-flight techniques is performed. The average deviation in ranging is similar to 0.75cm with >90% fitting accuracy, which corresponds to the uncertainty of the time-of-flight measurements due to the detector bandwidth. Simultaneous ranging and velocimetry are performed on a moving target. The velocimetry accuracy of the multi-tone continuous wave lidar is dictated by the frequency resolution of the Doppler shift, which is measured as +/- 0.8cm/s. The results indicate that multi-tone continuous wave lidars can be improved to perform remote sensing for oceanography and atmospheric sciences and for autonomous vehicles without using any amplitude, frequency or phase sweeping.

Time-resolved ion velocity measurements in a high-power Hall thruster using laser-induced fluorescence with transfer function averaging	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS	We present time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence measurements of ion velocity distributions in a 12.5kW Hall Effect Rocket with Magnetic Shielding (HERMeS) operating in both quasi-periodic and aperiodic oscillation regimes. Transfer function averaging in Fourier space is used to obtain useable signal-to-noise ratios and synchronize data traces taken at different laser wavelengths, measurement axes, and positions in the plasma, achieving a measurement bandwidth of similar to 100 kHz. For breathing-mode like global oscillations, the results are shown to be robust to the choice of either discharge current I d ( t ) or cathode-to-ground voltage V c g ( t ) as the reference waveform input to the transfer function. At discharge voltage V d = 600 V, a nearly periodic, impulsive oscillation in the acceleration zone position was accompanied by a greater than or similar to 100 V peak-to-peak oscillation in the near-plume plasma potential. Smaller amplitude, aperiodic oscillations in the mean ion velocities were detected at V d = 300 V.	[Chaplin, V. H.; Lobbia, R. B.; Ortega, A. Lopez; Mikellides, I. G.; Hofer, R. R.; Polk, J.

Tidal friction within Saturn causes its moons to migrate outwards, driving them into orbital resonances that pump their eccentricities or inclinations, which in turn leads to tidal heating of the moons. However, in giant planets, the dissipative processes that determine the tidal migration timescale remain poorly understood. Standard theories suggest an orbital expansion rate inversely proportional to the power 11/2 in distance(1), implying negligible migration for outer moons such as Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Here, we use two independent measurements obtained with the Cassini spacecraft to measure Titan's orbital expansion rate. We find that Titan rapidly migrates away from Saturn on a timescale of roughly ten billion years, corresponding to a tidal quality factor of Saturn of Q similar or equal to 100, which is more than a hundred times smaller than most expectations. Our results for Titan and five other moons agree with the predictions of a resonance-locking tidal theory(2), sustained by excitation of inertial waves inside the planet. The associated tidal expansion is only weakly sensitive to orbital distance, motivating a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's moon system. In particular, it suggests that Titan formed much closer to Saturn and has migrated outward to its current position. Titan is migrating away from Saturn on a much shorter timescale than expected, lending support to the resonance-locking tidal theory. This result motivates a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's moon system and may be relevant to other giant planets.

J	Kreisch, CD; Cyr-Racine, FY; Dore, O				Kreisch, Christina D.; Cyr-Racine, Francis-Yan; Dore, Olivier			Neutrino puzzle: Anomalies, interactions, and cosmological tensions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; WEIGHTED LIKELIHOOD RATIO; CONSTRAINTS; HYPOTHESES; EFFICIENT; EMISSION; MODEL; SCALE	New physics in the neutrino sector might be necessary to address anomalies between different neutrino oscillation experiments. Intriguingly, it also offers a possible solution to the discrepant cosmological measurements of H-0 and sigma(8). We show here that delaying the onset of neutrino free streaming until close to the epoch of matter-radiation equality can naturally accommodate a larger value for the Hubble constant H-0 = 72.3 +/- 1.4 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) and a lower value of the matter fluctuations sigma(8) = 0.786 +/- 0.020, while not degrading the fit to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) damping tail. We achieve this by introducing neutrino self-interactions in the presence of a nonvanishing sum of neutrino masses. Without explicitly incorporating additional neutrino species, this strongly interacting neutrino cosmology prefers N-eff = 4.02 +/- 0.29, which has interesting implications for particle model building and neutrino oscillation anomalies. We show that the absence of the neutrino free-streaming phase shift on the CMB can be compensated for by shifting the values of several cosmological parameters, hence providing an important caveat to the detections made in the literature. Due to their impact on the evolution of the gravitational potential at early times, self-interacting neutrinos and their subsequent decoupling leave a rich structure on the matter power spectrum. In particular, we point out the existence of a novel localized feature appearing on scales entering the horizon at the onset of neutrino free streaming. While the interacting neutrino cosmology provides a better global fit to current cosmological data, we find that traditional Bayesian analyses penalize the model as compared to the standard cosmological scenario due to the relatively narrow range of neutrino interaction strengths that is favored by the data. The model we present illustrates desirable cosmological impacts to simultaneously resolve the Hubble constant and matter clustering tensions rather than proposing a viable particle model. Our analysis shows that it is possible to find radically different cosmological models that nonetheless provide excellent fits to the data, hence providing an impetus to thoroughly explore alternate cosmological scenarios.

Snowfall Fraction, Cold Content, and Energy Balance Changes Drive Differential Response to Simulated Warming in an Alpine and Subalpine Snowpack	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						snow; climate change; snow modeling; snowpack energy balance; snowmelt	RAIN-ON-SNOW; DECLINING MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COLORADO RIVER; PRECIPITATION-PHASE; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; WATER AVAILABILITY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; UNITED-STATES; MODEL	Despite widespread warming in mountain regions, little research to date has explored the physical mechanisms driving the variable response of snowpacks to changes in climate, instead focusing primarily on empirical relationships, such as seasonal air temperature or elevation. In this work, we evaluate how differences in snowfall fraction, cold content, and the snowpack energy balance produce simulated changes to snow accumulation and melt at an alpine and subalpine snowpack in the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site. For our analysis, we created a 23 years baseline simulation using the SNOWPACK model forced by historical hourly meteorological data from water year 1991 through 2013. We then perturbed hourly air temperature in 0.5 degrees C increments from +0.5 to +4.0 degrees C above baseline and increased incoming longwave radiation accordingly. For every 1 degrees C of warming, peak snow water equivalent declined by 43.9 mm in the alpine and 54.3 mm in the subalpine, melt onset shifted 6.2 days earlier in the alpine and 8.8 days in the subalpine, the snow season shortened by 10.7 days in the alpine and 16.4 days in the subalpine, and melt rate increased by 0.2 mm d(-1)in the alpine while decreasing by 0.4 mm d(-1)in the subalpine. We found the alpine snowpack was less sensitive to warming for three primary reasons: (1) Snowfall fraction decreased less rapidly per 1 degrees C of warming than in the subalpine; (2) Cold content still consistently developed throughout the snow season, preventing mid-winter melt events; (3) Changes to snowmelt rate were not significant because increases to the turbulent fluxes balanced decreases in the radiative fluxes with earlier snowmelt onset. Additionally, at 3 degrees C of warming and greater, the subalpine site experienced a fundamental shift where significant melt could occur throughout the entirety of the winter as cold content was no longer large enough to buffer against positive energy fluxes. In some years, the subalpine snowpack became transient with several cycles of accumulation and melt per winter. This tipping point suggests sites with lower cold content-like the subalpine studied here-are likely to be more sensitive to producing increased winter melt as warming continues over the coming decades.

Molecular Selectivity of CO-N-2 Mixed Hydrates: Raman Spectroscopy and GCMC Studies	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							CARBON-MONOXIDE; CLATHRATE; METHANE; THERMODYNAMICS; SEPARATION; DIOXIDE; ORIGIN; CO2	This paper reports a novel quantitative investigation concerning the CO selectivity properties for mixed CO-N-2 hydrates. The study was developed by combining Raman scattering experiments and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Both approaches advocate in favor of saying that mixed CO-N-2 hydrates are CO selective and quantitatively compare with regard to the measured and calculated molecular selectivities. Intriguingly, this preferential CO encapsulation is enhanced by decreasing the CO molar fraction of the gas mixture. Here, an original explanation for this peculiar behavior is provided in terms of a structural change of the clathrates from SI to SII and in terms of the thermodynamics of mixtures. This last issue was clearly evidenced by using the ideal adsorption solution theory, which gives results that compare favorably with those obtained from Raman scattering and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations.

Understanding and improving model representation of aerosol optical properties for a Chinese haze event measured during KORUS-AQ	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOLS; SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; SOUTH-KOREA; PARTICULATE MATTER; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; HYGROSCOPIC GROWTH; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; MINERAL DUST; PART 1; SATELLITE	KORUS-AQ was an international cooperative air quality field study in South Korea that measured local and remote sources of air pollution affecting the Korean Peninsula during May-June 2016. Some of the largest aerosol mass concentrations were measured during a Chinese haze transport event (24 May). Air quality forecasts using the WRF-Chem model with aerosol optical depth (AOD) data assimilation captured AOD during this pollution episode but overpredicted surface particulate matter concentrations in South Korea, especially FM2.5, often by a factor of 2 or larger. Analysis revealed multiple sources of model deficiency related to the calculation of optical properties from aerosol mass that explain these discrepancies. Using in situ observations of aerosol size and composition as inputs to the optical prop- erties calculations showed that using a low-resolution size bin representation (four bins) underestimates the efficiency with which aerosols scatter and absorb light (mass extinction efficiency). Besides using finer-resolution size bins (8-16 bins), it was also necessary to increase the refractive indices and hygroscopicity of select aerosol species within the range of values reported in the literature to achieve better consistency with measured values of the mass extinction efficiency (6.7 m(2) g(-1) observed average) and light-scattering enhancement factor (f (RH)) due to aerosol hygroscopic growth (2.2 observed average). Furthermore, an evaluation of the optical properties obtained using modeled aerosol properties revealed the inability of sectional and modal aerosol representations in WRF-Chem to properly reproduce the observed size distribution, with the models displaying a much wider accumulation mode. Other model deficiencies included an underestimate of organic aerosol density (1.0 g cm(-3) in the model vs. observed average of 1.5 g cm(-3)) and an overprediction of the fractional contribution of submicron inorganic aerosols other than sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, chloride, and sodium corresponding to mostly dust (17 %-28 % modeled vs. 12 % estimated from observations). These results illustrate the complexity of achieving an accurate model representation of optical properties and provide potential solutions that are relevant to multiple disciplines and applications such as air quality forecasts, health impact assessments, climate projections, solar power forecasts, and aerosol data assimilation.

Four-dimensional surface motions of the Slumgullion landslide and quantification of hydrometeorological forcing	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; DEFORMATION; MOVEMENT; INSAR; COLORADO; MODEL	Landslides modify the natural landscape and cause fatalities and property damage worldwide. Quantifying landslide dynamics is challenging due to the stochastic nature of the environment. With its large area of similar to 1 km(2) and perennial motions at similar to 10-20mm per day, the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA, represents an ideal natural laboratory to better understand landslide behavior. Here, we use hybrid remote sensing data and methods to recover the four-dimensional surface motions during 2011-2018. We refine the boundaries of an area of similar to 0.35 km(2) below the crest of the prehistoric landslide. We construct a mechanical framework to quantify the rheology, subsurface channel geometry, mass flow rate, and spatiotemporally dependent pore-water pressure feedback through a joint analysis of displacement and hydrometeorological measurements from ground, air and space. Our study demonstrates the importance of remotely characterizing often inaccessible, dangerous slopes to better understand landslides and other quasi-static mass fluxes in natural and industrial environments, which will ultimately help reduce associated hazards.

This 119 Pg C per annum transfer of CO2 into plants-gross primary productivity (GPP)-is the largest land carbon flux globally. While understanding past and anticipated future GPP changes is necessary to support carbon management, the factors driving long-term changes in GPP are largely unknown. Here we show that 1901 to 2010 changes in GPP have been dominated by anthropogenic activity. Our dual constraint attribution approach provides three insights into the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP change. First, anthropogenic controls on GPP change have increased from 57% (1901 decade) to 94% (2001 decade) of the vegetated land surface. Second, CO2 fertilization and nitro gen deposition are the most important drivers of change, 19.8 and 11.1 Pg C per annum (2001 decade) respectively, especially in the tropics and industrialized areas since the 1970's. Third, changes in climate have functioned as fertilization to enhance GPP (1.4 Pg C per annum in the 2001 decade). These findings suggest that, from a land carbon balance perspective, the Anthropocene began over 100 years ago and that global change drivers have allowed GPP uptake to keep pace with anthropogenic emissions.

Impact ionization mass spectrometers can potentially achieve this by sampling water ice grains formed from ocean water and ejected by moons such as Enceladus and Europa, thereby exploring the habitability of their subsurface oceans in spacecraft flybys. Here, we extend previous high-sensitivity laser-based analog experiments of biomolecules in pure water to investigate the mass spectra of amino acids and fatty acids at simulated abiotic and biotic relative abundances. To account for the complex background matrix expected to emerge from a salty Enceladean ocean that has been in extensive chemical exchange with a carbonaceous rocky core, other organic and inorganic constituents are added to the biosignature mixtures. We find that both amino acids and fatty acids produce sodiated molecular peaks in salty solutions. Under the soft ionization conditions expected for low-velocity (2-6 km/s) encounters of an orbiting spacecraft with ice grains, the unfragmented molecular spectral signatures of amino acids and fatty acids accurately reflect the original relative abundances of the parent molecules within the source solution, enabling characteristic abiotic and biotic relative abundance patterns to be identified. No critical interferences with other abiotic organic compounds were observed. Detection limits of the investigated biosignatures under Enceladus-like conditions are salinity dependent (decreasing sensitivity with increasing salinity), at the mu M or nM level. The survivability and ionization efficiency of large organic molecules during impact ionization appears to be significantly improved when they are protected by a frozen water matrix. We infer from our experimental results that encounter velocities of 4-6 km/s are most appropriate for impact ionization mass spectrometers to detect and discriminate between abiotic and biotic signatures.

Effects of Amino Acids on Iron-Silicate Chemical Garden Precipitation	LANGMUIR			English	Article							HYDROTHERMAL VENTS; ENCELADUS; EVOLUTION; SULFUR; ORIGIN; TUBES; HYDRATION; MINERALS; SURFACES; GROWTH	Understanding the structure and behavior of chemical gardens is of interest for materials science, for understanding organic-mineral interactions, and for simulating geological mineral structures in hydrothermal systems on Earth and other worlds. Herein, we explored the effects of amino acids on inorganic chemical garden precipitate systems of iron chloride and sodium silicate to determine if/how the addition of organics can affect self-assembling morphologies or crystal growth. Amino acids affect chemical garden growth and morphology at the macro-scale and at the nanoscale. In this reaction system, the concentration of amino acid had a greater impact than the amino acid side chain, and increasing concentrations of organics caused structures to have smoother exteriors as amino acids accumulated on the outside surface. These results provide an example of how organic compounds can become incorporated into and influence the growth of inorganic self-organizing precipitates in far-from-equilibrium systems. Additionally, sample handing methods were developed to successfully image these delicate structures.

In the last few decades, a combination of stressors has produced significant declines in reef expanse, with declining reef health attributed largely to thermal stresses. We investigated the correspondence between time-series satellite remote sensing-based sea surface temperature (SST) datasets and ocean temperature monitored in situ at depth in coral reefs near La Parguera, Puerto Rico. In situ temperature data were collected for Cayo Enrique and Cayo Mario, San Cristobal, and Margarita Reef. The three satellite-based SST datasets evaluated were NOAA's Coral Reef Watch (CoralTemp), the UK Meteorological Office's Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA), and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (G1SST). All three satellite-based SST datasets assessed displayed a strong positive correlation (>0.91) with the in situ temperature measurements. However, all SST datasets underestimated the temperature, compared with the in situ measurements. A linear regression model using the SST datasets as the predictor for the in situ measurements produced an overall offset of similar to 1 degrees C for all three SST datasets. These results support the use of all three SST datasets, after offset correction, to represent the temperature regime at the depth of the corals in La Parguera, Puerto Rico.

Airborne and spaceborne L-band radar and full-waveform airborne lidar data are used to simulate the NISAR and GEDI mission, respectively. In addition to UAVSAR data, we use spaceborne ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 imagery with 14-day temporal baseline, which is comparable to NISAR's 12-day baseline. Our reference AGB maps are derived from the airborne LVIS data during the AfriSAR campaign for three sites (Mondah, Ogooue, and Lope). Each tropical site has mean AGB of at least 125 Mg/ha in addition to areas with AGB exceeding 700 Mg/ha. Spatially sampling from these LVIS-derived AGB reference maps, we approximate GEDI AGB estimates. To evaluate our methodology, we perform several different analyses. First, we partition each study site into low (<= 100 Mg/ha) and high (>100 Mg/ha) AGB areas, in conformity with the NISAR mission requirement to provide AGB estimates for forests between 0 and 100 Mg/ha with a RMSE below 20 Mg/ha. In the low AGB areas, this RMSE requirement is satisfied in Lope and Mondah and it fell short of the requirement in Ogooue by less 3 Mg/ha with UAVSAR and 6 Mg/ha with PALSAR-2. We note that our maps have finer spatial resolution (50 m) than NISAR requires (1 hectare). In the high AGB areas, the normalized RMSE increases to 51% (i.e., <90 Mg/ha), but with negligible bias for all three sites. Second, we train a single model to estimate AGB across both high and low AGB regimes simultaneously and obtain a normalized RMSE that is <60% (or <100 Mg/ha). Lastly, we show the use of both (a) multiscale superpixels and (b) interferometric coherence significantly improves the accuracy of the AGB estimates. The InSAR coherence improved the RMSE by approximately 8% at Mondah with both sensors, lowering the RMSE from 59 Mg/ha to 47.4 Mg/h with UAVSAR and from 57.1 Mg/ha to 46 Mg/ha. This work illustrates one of the numerous synergistic relationships between the spaceborne lidars, such as GEDI, with L-band SAR, such as PALSAR-2 and NISAR, in order to produce robust regional AGB in high biomass tropical regions.

This is motivated by the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, which will collect novel high-resolution wide-swath SSH measurements. The calibration/validation of SWOT will be in the California Current and requires independent observations of SSH spatial variability. Our objective was to discover how far we could push the space-time resolution of SSH maps based on the existing altimetry constellation. Currently, the best SSH maps for the region are from AVISO's global product based on optimal interpolation (OI). Our methodology is based on 2-D variational analysis (2DVAR), and we address some limitations of the AVISO OI global parameterization that restrict the resolution. Key improvements are (1) use of a background field incorporating mesoscale information, as opposed to a long-term mean field; (2) optimized regional parameters; and (3) a representation error term in the observational error covariance matrix to account for the spread of measurements in time. Using a suite of independent remote and in situ observations, we show the 2DVAR method can produce higher-resolution SSH maps in the California Current region that successfully capture smaller-scale ocean features than AVISO, at the expense of an increase in noise.

Fram Strait is the main gate for sea ice export from the Arctic. The average yearly sea ice export is 2,400 +/- 640 km(3). The mean and modal ULS ice thickness in Fram Strait decreased by 15% and 21% per decade, respectively, during 1990-2014. Combined with sea ice drift and area this leads to a decrease of the Arctic sea ice volume export of 27 +/- 2% per decade between 1992 and 2014. Thus, for the given time period, changes in sea ice export do not drive the sea ice volume decrease in the Arctic Basin. However, for individual years like 2007 and 2012 the ice export likely has contributed to the loss of summer sea ice. Combined with PIOMAS model simulation we estimate that 14% of the total Arctic sea ice volume is exported every year through Fram Strait. This fraction of the total sea ice volume exported per year does not show a trend because the Arctic Basin ice volume is decreasing at a similar rate as the Fram Strait ice volume export. Compared to ice velocities from Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) the satellite ice drift shows good correspondence in variability but a negative bias. Ice volume transport estimates presented here thus should be considered a conservative estimate. We show, however, that the transport estimates are not sensitive to the exact flux gate location.

Therefore, snow water equivalent (SWE) is a key parameter in the water cycle. Active and passive microwave remote sensing methods have been used to retrieve SWE due to relatively poor resolution of current in situ interpolated maps with good accuracy. However, estimation of SWE has proved challenging, despite several decades of efforts to develop retrieval approaches. Active sensors provide higher-resolution observations. Two recent promising retrieval algorithms using active data are dual frequency dual polarization backscattered power and differential interferometry. These retrieval algorithms have some restrictions on snow characteristics, the environment, and instrument properties. The restrictions limit the snow that is suitable for the specific retrieval algorithm. In order to better understand how much of the snowpack satisfies the precondition of these retrieval approaches, we use a 4 km gridded snowpack product over the contiguous US for years 1997 and 2015. We use a simple scattering model to simulate the scattering characteristics of snow. The snow property maps, simulated scattering characteristics of snow, and environmental conditions are used to filter the suitable snow for each retrieval algorithm. We show that snow wetness and vegetation coverage are the two main limiting conditions for these retrieval algorithms. We show that 39% and 44% of the grid-points with snow satisfy the preconditions of dual polarization dual frequency retrieval algorithms at 13.5 GHz (one of the recommended frequencies for this algorithm in the literature) in 1997 and 2015, respectively. The most important limiting factors for dual polarization dual frequency retrieval method are dryness of snow, penetration depth, and vegetation-free constraints. The backscattered power in dual polarization dual frequency method is more sensitive to snow density and grain radius rather than to snow depth. We also show that 55% and 53% of the grid-points with snow satisfy the precondition of differential interferometry retrieval algorithms at 1 GHz (one of the recommended frequencies for this algorithm in the literature) in 1997 and 2015, respectively. The most important precondition-limiting factors for differential interferometry are dryness of snow and vegetation-free constraints. The differential interferometry phase retrieval algorithm is equally sensitive to snow height and snow density variations and is independent of snow grain radius.

Here, a methane biogeochemistry model was revised, parameterized, and verified for various wetland ecosystems across the globe. The model was then extrapolated to the global scale to quantify the uncertainty induced from four different types of uncertainty sources including parameterization, wetland type distribution, wetland area distribution, and meteorological input. We found that global wetland emissions are 212 +/- 62 and 212 +/- 32 Tg CH(4)year(-1)(1Tg = 10(12) g) due to uncertain parameters and wetland type distribution, respectively, during 2000-2012. Using two wetland distribution data sets and three sets of climate data, the model simulations indicated that the global wetland emissions range from 186 to 212 CH(4)year(-1)for the same period. The parameters were the most significant uncertainty source. After combining the global methane consumption in the range of -34 to -46 Tg CH(4)year(-1), we estimated that the global net land methane emissions are 149-176 Tg CH(4)year(-1)due to uncertain wetland distribution and meteorological input. Spatially, the northeast United States and Amazon were two hotspots of methane emission, while consumption hotspots were in the Eastern United States and eastern China. During 1950-2016, both wetland emissions and upland consumption increased during El Nino events and decreased during La Nina events. This study highlights the need for more in situ methane flux data, more accurate wetland type, and area distribution information to better constrain the model uncertainty.

Interannual Variability of Carbon Uptake of Secondary Forests in the Brazilian Amazon (2004-2014)	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES			English	Article							ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; ALOS PALSAR; LAND-USE; DEFORESTATION; COVER; EMISSIONS; IMPACT; MAP; REFORESTATION; BIODIVERSITY	Tropical secondary forests (SF) play an important role in the global carbon cycle as a major terrestrial carbon sink. Here, we use high-resolution TerraClass data set for tracking land use activities in the Brazilian Amazon from 2004-2014 to detect spatial patterns and carbon sequestration dynamics of secondary forests (SF). By integrating satellite lidar and radar observations, we found the SF area in the Brazilian Amazon increased from approximately 22 Mha (10(6) ha) in 2004 to 28 Mha in 2014. However, the expansion in area was also accompanied by a dynamic land use activity that resulted in about 50% recycling of SF area annually from frequent clearing and abandonment. Consequently, the average age of SF remained less than 10 years (age similar to 8.2 with one standard deviation of 3.2 spatially) over the period of the study. Estimation of changes of carbon stocks shows that SF accumulates approximately 8.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) aboveground biomass during the first 10 years after clearing and abandonment, 4.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for the next 10 years followed by a more gradual increase of 3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) from 20 to 30 years with much slower rate thereafter. The effective carbon uptake of SF in Brazilian Amazon was negligible (0.06 +/- 0.03 PgC year(-1)) during this period, but the interannual variability was significantly larger (+/- 0.2 PgC year(-1)) If the SF areas were left to grow without further clearing for 100 years, it would absorb about 0.14 PgC year(-1) from the atmosphere, partially compensating the emissions from current rate of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

Practical methods of overcoming traditional limitations of SDRadar and stepped chirp radar are introduced, and the performance is demonstrated using a commercial battery-powered universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio (SDR). Application-specific considerations are made and performance tradeoffs are demonstrated. Furthermore, the method is shown to be the coherence solution for otherwise noncoherent low-cost communications' SDR systems. The proposed design has multiple applications in low-cost, reconfigurable ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platforms.

Two-Year Observations of the Jupiter Polar Regions by JIRAM on Board Juno	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Jupiter; planetary atmosphere; polar regions; composition; Mesoscale dynamics	POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; CLOUD STRUCTURE; SURFACE; DYNAMICS	We observed the evolution of Jupiter's polar cyclonic structures over two years between February 2017 and February 2019, using polar observations by the Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper, JIRAM, on the Juno mission. Images and spectra were collected by the instrument in the 5-mu m wavelength range. The images were used to monitor the development of the cyclonic and anticyclonic structures at latitudes higher than 80 degrees both in the northern and the southern hemispheres. Spectroscopic measurements were then used to monitor the abundances of the minor atmospheric constituents water vapor, ammonia, phosphine, and germane in the polar regions, where the atmospheric optical depth is less than 1. Finally, we performed a comparative analysis with oceanic cyclones on Earth in an attempt to explain the spectral characteristics of the cyclonic structures we observe in Jupiter's polar atmosphere.

Subsurface Structure at the InSight Landing Site From Compliance Measurements by Seismic and Meteorological Experiments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						InSight; compliance; inversion; subsurface; Young modulus; regolith	NOISE; MISSION; MARS; REDUCTION; WAVES	Measurements of ground compliance at the InSight landing site-describing the surface response to pressure loading-are obtained from seismic and meteorological data. Compliance observations show an increase with frequency indicating the presence of a stiffer rock layer beneath the exposed regolith. We performed a Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion to investigate the vertical profile of the elastic parameters down to 20 m below InSight. Compliance was inverted both freely and assuming prior knowledge of compaction in the regolith, and the limitations and strengths of the methods were assessed on the basis of theoretical considerations and synthetic tests. The inverted Young modulus exhibits an increase by a factor of 10-100 over the first 10-15 m, compatible with a structural discontinuity between 0.7 and 7 m. The proposed scheme can be used for joint inversion of other seismic, geological, or mechanical constraints to refine the resulting vertical section.

Orbit-Spin Coupling and the Triggering of the Martian Planet-Encircling Dust Storm of 2018	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars atmosphere; Mars dust storm; orbit-spin coupling; S2D; S2S	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARS YEARS; CYCLE; ATMOSPHERE; SURFACE; IMPACT; SIMULATION; RESOLUTION; EVOLUTION	The Martian global dust storm (GDS) of 2018 began soon after the southern spring equinox, which is quite early in the dust storm season. The origins of early-season GDS, including those of 1977, 2001, and now 2018, have been mysterious, as atmospheric dynamical investigations and numerical modeling experiments have been unable to explain or reproduce the timing of these events. We employ a newly expanded catalog of historic Martian GDS for our investigation, which includes 2018 and the telescopically observed equinoctial dust storms of 1877 and 1909. All of the GDS of this catalog took place either (1) when orbit-spin coupling torques on the Martian atmosphere were near peak values or (2) near times when the orbit-spin coupling torques were changing most rapidly. The second category, here termed "Mode 2," includes all six of the equinoctial GDS of the historic record, including 2018. Recognition of the existence of two triggering modes for GDS occurrence leads to a significant improvement in temporal resolution for both hindcasting and forecasting. Orbit-spin coupling now provides explanations for the late-season inception dates of the 1924 and 1973 storms, as well as for the equinoctial events. We provide conditional forecasts, with sub-seasonal time resolution, for GDS occurrence and non-occurrence in Mars years 35 through 40. We introduce a detailed working hypothesis for the genesis of equinoctial GDS that may be validated through numerical modeling. The characteristic timescale for frictional damping of an intensified Martian Hadley circulation is estimated to be O(10) sols.

Juno Waves Detection of Dust Impacts Near Jupiter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							PARTICLE IMPACTS; MAGNETIC-FIELD; RING-SYSTEM; PLASMA; VOYAGER; INTERPLANETARY; SIGNALS; SATURN; RADIO; GALILEO	The Juno spacecraft entered orbit at Jupiter on 5 July 2016. Since then, Juno has orbited Jupiter in high inclination orbits, crossing the ring plane near perijove. During 20 of the first 21 crossings, the Waves instrument detected signals associated with dust impacts. The impact rate profiles show peaks of order 6 s(-1 )around the ring plane with half width at half maximum similar to 2,000-3,000 km. The polarity ratio of the impact signals did not follow the areas of the antennas exposed to dust impacts that change due to the rotation of the spacecraft, suggesting Waves detects impacts on the Juno spacecraft and not just on the Waves antennas. The impact rate profile changed during Perijove 19, when the spacecraft rotation axis was tilted to the south, increasing the area of the solar panels exposed to impacts, indicating that the detected impacts were on the spacecraft body. Grain sizes of order 1 gm are estimated, and the differential size distribution has a slope of -5.1 and with number densities of order 3 x 10(-6) m(-3). Plain Language Summary Once each orbit, Juno passes within a few to several thousand kilometers of Jupiter's cloudtops at low latitudes. These passes carry the spacecraft through Jupiter's ring plane. The radio and plasma wave instrument on Juno called Waves detects voltage spikes when passing through this plane, even though Juno is well below what is thought to be the inner edge of the known ring system. These spikes are due to impacts by micron-sized grains of dust at relative speeds upward of 70 km s(-1). At such speeds, the dust and even a tiny part of the spacecraft are immediately vaporized and heated to a high enough temperature to form a rapidly expanding cloud of electrons and ions. These clouds momentarily disrupt the potential around the spacecraft causing an impulse in the Waves electric sensor. During the first 21 Juno orbits we find peak impact rates of about 6 per second mainly confined to within 2,000-3,000 km of the ring plane. We estimate the size of these grains in the range of microns, about the size of particles in cigarette smoke.	[Ye, S. -Y.; Averkamp, T. F.; Kurth, W.

MAVEN ROSE Observations of the Response of the Martian Ionosphere to Dust Storms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						electron density profiles at Mars; M2 layer; dust storms effects on Mars ionosphere	RADIO OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS; MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR; ELECTRON-DENSITY PROFILES; OPTICAL DEPTH; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERE; TOPOGRAPHY; MARINER-9; TES	During a Martian dust storm, the lower atmosphere is heated locally. Due to dynamical effects, the upper atmosphere and ionosphere can be lifted upward on a global scale by approximately 10 km. The connections between lower atmospheric dust events and associated ionospheric responses are poorly understood due to limited observations. Here, we present MAVEN Radio Occultation Science Experiment (ROSE) observations of ionospheric peak altitude during dust events in 2018 and 2016. In June 2018, a planet-encircling dust event arose from the Acidalia storm track in the northern hemisphere. Ionospheric peak altitudes at around 20 degrees S were normal in ROSE egress observations on 19 June and 22 June and then 10-15 km higher on 26 June and thereafter. Ionospheric peak altitudes at around 50 degrees N were also elevated in ROSE ingress observations, which began on 17 June. This suggests that the ionospheric peak altitude was affected by the dust event in the northern hemisphere before the southern hemisphere. We also observe evidence that smaller dust storms can trigger ionospheric responses: In July-October 2016, ionospheric peak altitudes at solar zenith angles of 54-70 degrees and latitudes of 50-80 degrees S were 20 km higher than expected. These observations were acquired during a modest "A storm" during a year without a global dust storm.

Such worlds are representative of early Earth, Mars, and Venus and analogous exoplanets. Photodissociation of H2O controls the atmospheric photochemistry of these worlds through production of reactive OH, which dominates the removal of atmospheric trace gases. The near-UV (NUV; >200 nm) absorption cross sections of H2O play an outsized role in OH production; these cross sections were heretofore unmeasured at habitable temperatures (<373 K). We present the first measurements of NUV H2O absorption at 292 K and show it to absorb orders of magnitude more than previously assumed. To explore the implications of these new cross sections, we employ a photochemical model; we first intercompare it with two others and resolve past literature disagreement. The enhanced OH production due to these higher cross sections leads to efficient recombination of CO and O-2, suppressing both by orders of magnitude relative to past predictions and eliminating the low-outgassing "false-positive" scenario for O(2)as a biosignature around solar-type stars. Enhanced [OH] increases rainout of reductants to the surface, relevant to prebiotic chemistry, and may also suppress CH(4)and H-2; the latter depends on whether burial of reductants is inhibited on the underlying planet, as is argued for abiotic worlds. While we focus on CO2-rich worlds, our results are relevant to anoxic planets in general. Overall, our work advances the state of the art of photochemical models by providing crucial new H2O cross sections and resolving past disagreement in the literature and suggests that detection of spectrally active trace gases like CO in rocky exoplanet atmospheres may be more challenging than previously considered.

However, the short wavelength of these radars limits their maximum unambiguous Doppler velocity. A common solution to this problem is to subsequently unfold the Doppler velocity estimate with the staggered pulse repetition time (PRT) algorithm, which requires two different PRTs to be employed in sequence. This article investigates a potentially more rapid method to extend the Doppler velocity Nyquist interval. We estimate Doppler velocity using a pair of frequency diverse pulses separated by a time lag that is significantly shorter than the PRT. During the first PRT, two pulses with center frequencies f(1), followed by f(2), separated by a lag tau are transmitted. During the next PRT, the pulses transmitted are in the order f(2) followed by f(1). Doppler velocity is then estimated using the sum of the Doppler phases derived from f(1)/f(2) and f(2)/f(1) sequences. The focus of this article is the demonstration of this algorithm in a beam-filled scenario and the error canceling algorithm design. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations and data collected with the NASA Goddard Space Flight center's Cloud Radar System, the algorithm is demonstrated on nearly static surface echoes. Projected aircraft speeds and traditional pulse-pair estimates are employed as references. The algorithm was found to perform adequately on surface echoes for a low spectrum width of the order of 0.5 m/s and SNR comparable to 20 dB. Doppler velocity retrievals in a cirrus cloud layer with low velocity turbulence retained some qualitative structure, albeit with significantly degraded precision due to the lost coherence.

The processes responsible for this coupling are difficult to verify due to the paucity of accurate air-sea turbulent heat and moisture flux data. These fluxes are currently derived by combining satellite measurements that are not coincident and have differing and relatively low spatial resolutions, introducing sampling errors that are largest in regions with high spatial and temporal variability. Observational errors related to sensor design also contribute to increased uncertainty. Leveraging recent advances in sensor technology, we here describe a satellite mission concept, FluxSat, that aims to simultaneously measure all variables necessary for accurate estimation of ocean-atmosphere turbulent heat and moisture fluxes and capture the effect of oceanic mesoscale forcing. Sensor design is expected to reduce observational errors of the latent and sensible heat fluxes by almost 50%. FluxSat will improve the accuracy of the fluxes at spatial scales critical to understanding the coupled ocean-atmosphere boundary layer system, providing measurements needed to improve weather forecasts and climate model simulations.

In situ activities at sampling stations were systematically documented by the astronauts using a series of overlapping images taken with their Hasselblad cameras. We investigated how this Apollo image archive can be used to perform 3-D reconstructions of several boulders of interest using close-range photogrammetry. We specifically focused on seven different boulders located at Stations 2, 6, and 7, at the foot of South and North Massifs, respectively. These boulders represent samples from highland materials, which rolled down the slopes of the surrounding hills. We used the Agisoft Metashape software to compute 3-D reconstructions of these boulders, using 173 scanned images as input. We then used either a web-based platform or a game engine to render the models in virtual reality. This allowed the users to walk around the boulders and to investigate in detail their morphology, fractures, vesicles, color variations, and sampling spots, as if standing directly in front of them with the astronauts. This work suggests that many features can be reconstructed in other sites of the Apollo missions, so as other robotic landing sites. Virtual reality techniques coupled to photogrammetry is thus opening a new era of exploration, both for past and future landing sites.

Because in situ observations derived from coastal/tropical moored buoys and Argo floats are only representatives of one specific geographical point, they cannot be used to measure spatial gradients of ocean parameters (i.e., two-dimensional vectors). In this study, we exploit the high temporal sampling of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) Saildrone (i.e., one measurement per minute) and describe a methodology to compare the magnitude of SST and SSS gradients derived from satellite-based products with those captured by Saildrone. Using two Saildrone campaigns conducted in the California/Baja region in 2018 and in the North Atlantic Gulf Stream in 2019, we compare the magnitude of gradients derived from six different GHRSST Level 4 SST (MUR, OSTIA, CMC, K10, REMSS, and DMI) and two SSS (JPLSMAP, RSS40km) datasets. While results indicate strong consistency between Saildrone- and satellite-based observations of SST and SSS, this is not the case for derived gradients with correlations lower than 0.4 for SST and 0.1 for SSS products.

Antenna Design and Prelaunch Performance of a Low-Cost 118.75 GHz Temperature Sounding CubeSat Radiometer With 3-D-Printed Corrugated Feed and Offset Reflector Optics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION			English	Article						3-D-printed corrugated horn; CubeSat radiometer; Fourier analysis; microwave radiometry; offset reflector; prelaunch calibration; quasi-optics	MICROWAVE; HORN	This article describes the design and prelaunch performance of the antenna subsystem of the low-cost 118.75 GHz temperature sounding radiometer payload used in the PolarCube and GEMS-IOD 3U CubeSat missions. Radiometric sounding measurements used for providing data for weather prediction are strongly affected by the main beam, ohmic, and spillover efficiencies of the optics, as well as by inhomogeneities in the scene and background radiation fields. The interpretation of radiometric data is affected by the accuracy with which these antenna efficiencies can be determined, particularly for radiometers that do not permit full main beam external calibration. To this end, an HE11 mode full wave Fourier-Bessel electromagnetic field analysis was developed for determination of an optimal feed horn and reflector geometry such that the main beam and spillover efficiencies of the system are maximized, and these and the antenna phase center location that maximizes phase efficiency are precisely known. The efficacy of employing a sub-millimeter wave 3-D-printed corrugated conical horn operable between 110 and 127 GHz as the feed for an offset paraboloidal reflector due to its very low cost and rapid manufacturability is also addressed. Horn measurements indicate a reflection coefficient below -15 dB and far-field radiation patterns that compare closely to simulation. Although there is some asymmetry in the horn pattern, the average main beam efficiency is 89% for a main reflector subtending a 16 degrees half-angle. Initial performance obtained from airborne measurements over Antarctica on the NASA DC-8 during Operation IceBridge in Oct-Nov 2016 suggests a well-focused scanning antenna subsystem. After final payload assembly, the antenna's 3 dB beamwidth extracted from a bridge-scan field experiment was broader by similar to 0.1 degrees compared with the idealized simulated pattern.

Searching for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in X-Rays	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Active galaxies; Surveys; X-ray sources	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; GALAXY CLUSTERS; VARIABILITY; POPULATION; QUASARS; ACCRETION; MERGERS	Theory predicts that a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) could be observed as a luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) that periodically varies on the order of its orbital timescale. In X-rays, periodic variations could be caused by mechanisms including relativistic Doppler boosting and shocks. Here we present the first systematic search for periodic AGNs using 941 hard X-ray light curves (14-195 keV) from the first 105 months of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) survey (2004-2013). We do not find evidence for periodic AGNs in Swift-BAT, including the previously reported SMBHB candidate MCG+11-11-032. We find that the null detection is consistent with the combination of the upper-limit binary population in AGNs in our adopted model, their expected periodic variability amplitudes, and the BAT survey characteristics. We have also investigated the detectability of SMBHBs against normal AGN X-ray variability in the context of the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) survey. Under our assumptions of a binary population and the periodic signals they produce, which have long periods of hundreds of days, up to 13% true periodic binaries can be robustly distinguished from normal variable AGNs with the ideal uniform sampling. However, we demonstrate that realistic eROSITA sampling is likely to be insensitive to long-period binaries because longer observing gaps reduce their detectability. In contrast, large observing gaps do not diminish the prospect of detecting binaries of short, few-day periods, as 19% can be successfully recovered, the vast majority of which can be identified by the first half of the survey.

We extend our 2D-axisymmetric nonideal MHD model of these outflows by incorporating radiative transfer and simplified thermochemistry, with the dual aims of exploring how heating influences wind launching and illustrating how such models can be tested through observations of diagnostic spectral lines. Our model disks launch magnetocentrifugal outflows primarily through magnetic tension forces, so the mass-loss rate increases only moderately when thermochemical effects are switched on. For typical field strengths, thermochemical and irradiation heating are more important than magnetic dissipation. We furthermore find that the entrained vertical magnetic flux diffuses out of the disk on secular timescales as a result of nonideal MHD. Through postprocessing line radiative transfer, we demonstrate that spectral line intensities and moment-1 maps of atomic oxygen, the HCN molecule, and other species show potentially observable differences between a model with a magnetically driven outflow and one with a weaker, photoevaporative outflow. In particular, the line shapes and velocity asymmetries in the moment-1 maps could enable the identification of outflows emanating from the disk surface.

DES Collaboration	Supernova Siblings: Assessing the Consistency of Properties of Type Ia Supernovae that Share the Same Parent Galaxies	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Observational cosmology	LUMINOSITY; DISTANCE; SOFTWARE; RATES; MASS	While many studies have shown a correlation between properties of the light curves of SNe Ia and properties of their host galaxies, it remains unclear what is driving these correlations. We introduce a new direct method to study these correlations by analyzing "parent" galaxies that host multiple SNe Ia "siblings." Here, we search the Dark Energy Survey SN sample, one of the largest samples of discovered SNe, and find eight galaxies that hosted two likely SNe Ia. Comparing the light-curve properties of these SNe and recovered distances from the light curves, we find no better agreement between properties of SNe in the same galaxy as any random pair of galaxies, with the exception of the SN light-curve stretch. We show at 2.8 sigma significance that at least one-half of the intrinsic scatter of SNe Ia distance modulus residuals is not from common host properties. We also discuss the robustness with which we could make this evaluation with LSST, which will find 100x more pairs of galaxies, and pave a new line of study on the consistency of SNe Ia in the same parent galaxies. Finally, we argue that it is unlikely that some of these SNe are actually single, lensed SN with multiple images.

Efficient Computation of Optimal Low Thrust Gravity Perturbed Orbit Transfers	JOURNAL OF THE ASTRONAUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	John L.

The algorithm is formulated via the indirect optimization method, leading to a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). We make use of a hyperbolic tangent smoothing law for performing continuation on the thrust magnitude to reduce the sharpness of the control switches in early iterations and thus promote convergence. The TPBVP is solved using the method of particular solutions (MPS) shooting method and Picard-Chebyshev numerical integration. Application of Picard-Chebyshev integration affords an avenue for increased efficiency that is not available with step-by-step integrators. We demonstrate that computing the particular solutions with only a low-fidelity force model greatly increases the efficiency of the algorithm while ultimately achieving near machine precision accuracy. A salient feature of the MPS is that it is parallelizable, and thus further speedups are available. It is also shown that, for near-Earth orbits and over a small number of en-route revolutions around the Earth, only the zonal perturbation terms are required in the costate equations to obtain a solution that is accurate to machine precision and optimal to engineering precision. The proposed framework can be used for trajectory design around small asteroids and also for orbit debris rendezvous and removal tasks.

One of the main objectives of this long-term timing is to use the large asymmetry in gravitational binding energy between the neutron star and the WD to test gravitational theories. Such tests, however, will be eventually limited by the accuracy of the distance to the pulsar. Here, we present very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) astrometry results spanning approximately 2.5 yr for PSR.J1012+5307, obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array as part of the MSPSRp project. These provide the first proper motion and absolute position for PSR.J1012+5307 measured in a quasi-inertial reference frame. From the VLBI results, we measure a distance of 0.83(-0.02)(+0.06) kpc (all the estimates presented in the abstract are at 68% confidence) for PSR.J1012+5307, which is the most precise obtained to date. Using the new distance, we improve the uncertainty of measurements of the unmodeled contributions to orbital period decay, which, combined with three other pulsars, places new constraints on the coupling constant for dipole gravitational radiation kappa(D) = (-1.7 +/- 1.7) x 10(-4) and the fractional time derivative of Newton's gravitational constant (G)over dot/G = 1.8(-4.7)(+5.6) x 10(-13) yr(-1) in the local universe. As the uncertainties of the observed decays of orbital period for the four leading pulsar-WD systems become negligible in approximate to 10 yr, the uncertainties for (G)over dot/G and kappa(D) will be improved to <= 1.5 x 10(-13) yr(-1) and <= 1.0 x 10(-4), respectively, predominantly limited by the distance uncertainties.

The formation of deleterious phases along a particular composition path can cause significant cracking during the AM build process that makes the composition path unviable to produce structurally stable FGMs, but it is challenging to predict which phases will be present in as-built additively manufactured parts by analyzing only equilibrium phase relations. Solute segregation during solidification can lead to the formation of non-equilibrium phases that are stable at compositions far from the nominal composition of the melt, leading to crack formation. In this work, we developed and validated a Scheil-Gulliver simulation tool based on pycalphad. We used this tool to compare the non-equilibrium phases predicted to form during the AM build process using the Scheil-Gulliver model with experimentally measured phases at several locations with different composition in a Ti-6Al-4V to Invar-36 FGM and a commercially pure Ti to Invar-36 FGM. We showed that the phases predicted to form by the Scheil-Gulliver model agree better with the experimental results than the predictions made by assuming equilibrium solidification, proving that the Scheil-Gulliver model can be applied to FGMs. Further, we demonstrated the use of our Scheil-Gulliver simulation tool as a method of designing FGMs through screening potential FGM pathways by calculating the solidification phase fractions along the experimental gradient path in composition space.

We use Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution images in the GOODS-S field from the the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and fit multiwavelength lights in resolution elements of galaxies with stellar population synthesis models. We then construct resolved kpc-scale stellar mass, SFR surface density curves for galaxies atz similar to 1. Fitting these resolved main sequence curves with Schechter functions, we parameterize and explain the multiwavelength structure of galaxies with three variables:*,alpha, andM*. For quenched galaxies below the main sequence, we find an average high-mass slope (alpha) of the resolved main sequence curves to be similar to-0.4. The scatter of this slope is higher among the lower mass star-forming galaxies and those above the main sequence compared to quenched galaxies, due to lack of an evolved bulge. Our findings agree well with an inside-out quenching of star formation. We find that the knee of the Schechter fits (M*) for galaxies below the main sequence occurs at lower stellar mass surface densities compared to star-forming galaxies, which hints at how far quenching has proceeded outward.

A Redshift for the First Einstein Ring, MG 1131+0456	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Gravitational lensing	EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; RADIO GALAXIES; QUASAR; SKY; SPECTROSCOPY; MG1131+0456; DISCOVERY; IMAGES	MG 1131+0456 is a radio-selected gravitational lens, and is the first known Einstein ring. Discovered in 1988, the system consists of a bright (S-74 MHz = 3.7 Jy) radio source imaged into a ring and two compact, flat-spectrum components separated by 21. The ring is optically faint (R = 23.3), rising steeply into the near- and mid-infrared (K = 17.8; W2 = 13.4). The system has been intensively studied in the intervening years, including high-resolution radio imaging, radio monitoring, and near-infrared imaging with Hubble and Keck. The lensing galaxy is atz(l) = 0.844. However, to date, no spectroscopic redshift had been reported for the lensed source. Using archival Keck data from 1997, we report the robust detection of a single narrow emission line at 5438 A, which we associate with Ciii] lambda 1909 A from a type-2 quasar atz(s) = 1.849. Support for this redshift identification comes from weaker emission associated with Civ lambda 1549 A and Heii lambda 1640 A, typical of type-2 quasars, as well as the lack of emission lines in archival near-infrared Keck spectroscopy. We also present, for the first time, Cycle 1 Chandra observations of MG 1131+0456, which clearly resolves into two point sources with a combined flux of similar to 10(-13)erg cm(-2)s(-1)and a best-fit column density of similar to 3 x 10(22)cm(-2). We suggest a new method to identify candidate lensed active galactic nuclei from low-resolution X-ray surveys such as eROSITA by targeting sources that have anomalously high X-ray luminosity given their mid-infrared luminosity.

Jupiter in the Ultraviolet: Acetylene and Ethane Abundances in the Stratosphere of Jupiter from Cassini Observations between 0.15 and 0.19 mu m	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Jupiter; Ultraviolet astronomy; Planetary atmospheres; Outer planets; Solar system planets; Spectroscopy	PHOTOABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; HIGH-RESOLUTION; OSCILLATOR-STRENGTHS; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; RAMAN-SCATTERING; SPECTROGRAPH; ATMOSPHERE; AMMONIA; C2H2; PROFILES	At wavelengths between 0.15 and 0.19 mu m, the far-ultraviolet spectrum of Jupiter is dominated by the scattered solar spectrum, attenuated by molecular absorptions primarily by acetylene and ethane, and to a lesser extent ammonia and phosphine. We describe the development of our radiative transfer code that enables the retrieval of abundances of these molecular species from ultraviolet reflectance spectra. As a proof-of-concept we present an analysis of Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observations of the disk of Jupiter during the 2000/2001 flyby. The ultraviolet-retrieved acetylene abundances in the upper stratosphere are lower than those predicted by models based solely on infrared thermal emission from the mid-stratosphere observed by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS), requiring an adjustment to the vertical profiles above 1 mbar. We produce a vertical acetylene abundance profile that is compatible with both CIRS and UVIS, with reduced abundances at pressures <1 mbar: the 0.1 mbar abundances are 1.21 0.07 ppm for acetylene and 20.8 5.1 ppm for ethane. Finally, we perform a sensitivity study for the JUICE ultraviolet spectrograph, which has extended wavelength coverage out to 0.21 mu m, enabling the retrieval of ammonia and phosphine abundances, in addition to acetylene and ethane.

Swift Monitoring of M51: A 38 day Superorbital Period for the Pulsar ULX7 and a New Transient Ultraluminous X-Ray Source	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						X-ray point sources; X-ray transient sources; X-ray photometry; X-ray bright point; X-ray active galactic nuclei; Transient sources; Light curves; Galaxy nuclei; Active galactic nuclei	BLACK-HOLE; DISCOVERY; MASS; PULSATIONS; ACCRETION; EMISSION; BINARY	We present the results from a monitoring campaign made with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of the M51 galaxies, which contain several variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The ongoing campaign started in 2018 May, and we report here on similar to 1.5 yr of observations. The campaign, which consists of 106 observations, has a typical cadence of 3-6 days, and has the goal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the most variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered by neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by factors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron-star-powered ULXs are the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a periodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and a half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is known to be 2 days, the modulation is superorbital, which is a near-ubiquitous property of ULX pulsars. Second, we identify a new transient ULX, M51 XT-1, the onset of which occurred during our campaign, reaching a peak luminosity of similar to 10(40) erg s(-1), before gradually fading over the next similar to 200 days until it slipped below the detection limit of our observations. Combined with the high-quality Swift/X-ray Telescope lightcurve of the transient, serendipitous observations made with Chandra and XMM-Newton provide insights into the onset and evolution of a likely super-Eddington event.

Single-look backscatter measurements are plotted against the InSAR phase height and are aggregated spatially over a forest patch to form a 3-D histogram, referred to as InSAR backscatter-height histogram or simply InSAR histogram. InSAR histograms resemble LiDAR waveforms, suggesting that existing algorithms used to retrieve canopy height and ground topography from radar tomograms or LiDAR waveforms can be applied to InSAR histograms. Three algorithms are evaluated to generate maps of digital terrain, surface, and canopy height models: Gaussian decomposition, quantile, and backscatter threshold. Full-polarimetric L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) data collected over the Gabonese Lop & x00E9; National Park during the 2016 AfriSAR campaign are used to illustrate and compare the performance of the algorithms for the HH, HV, VV, HH & x002B;VV, and HH & x2212;VV polarimetric channels. Results show that radar-derived maps using the InSAR histograms differ by 4 m (top-canopy), 5 m (terrain), and 6 m (forest height) in terms of average root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from standard maps derived from full-waveform laser, vegetation, and ice sensor (LVIS) LiDAR measurements.

Single-channel algorithm (SCA) and dual-channel algorithm (DCA) are implemented for the processing of SMAP radiometer data. The SCA using the vertically polarized brightness temperature (SCA-V) has been providing satisfactory SMretrievals. However, the DCA using prelaunch design and algorithm parameters for vertical and horizontal polarization data has a marginal performance. In this article, we show that with the updates of the roughness parameter h and the polarization mixing parameters Q, a modified DCA (MDCA) can achieve improved accuracy over DCA; it also allows for the retrieval of vegetation optical depth (VOD or tau). The retrieval performance of MDCA is assessed and compared with SCA-V and DCA using four years (April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2019) of in situ data from core validation sites (CVSs) and sparse networks. The assessment shows that SCA-V still outperforms all the implemented algorithms.	[Chaubell, Mario Julian; Yueh, Simon H.; Dunbar, R.

Compared to other computational EM algorithms, the PSTD solver is both memory-efficient and accurate for sounding applications. New domain designs are developed to efficiently simulate 2-D scattering of half-space media for normal and oblique incidence from arbitrary wave sources. As a validation of the PSTD simulator, the simulated 2-D scattering radar cross width (RCW) is compared with the analytical solutions of both point targets (dielectric cylinders) and distributed targets (random rough surfaces), for the first time, where the frequency and angular (bistatic scattering) dependence are studied with various choices of grid sampling resolution. Furthermore, the PSTD solver is applied to passive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sounding problems (single transmitter and several receivers), for the first time, where various scenarios (e.g., cylinder, surface, and volume) are demonstrated and the targets are correctly resolved after focusing, indicating an accurate simulation of the phase history. Finally, an example of using the solver is shown for emulating 3-D large-scale radar sounding problems with cross-track surface and subsurface scattering. This is particularly useful to simulate radar sounding returns and SAR-focused imagery of large-scale subsurface structures to better support planetary missions with radar sounding instruments.

Prior studies have attempted to characterize such oil slicks, primarily through analysis of polarimetric SAR data. In this article, we factor in system noise that is added to the backscattered signal, introducing artifacts that can easily be confused with random and volume scattering. This confusion occurs when additive and/or multiplicative system noise dominates the measured backscattered signal. Polarimetric features used in this article are shown to be affected by both additive and multiplicative system noise, some more than others. This article highlights the importance of considering specifically multiplicative noise in the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR based on additive noise should at least be above 10 dB and the SNR involving both additive and multiplicative noise should at least be above 0 dB. The SNR from TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and Radarsat-2 (RS-2) is below 0 dB for the majority of the oil slick pixels when considering both the additive and multiplicative noise, rendering these data unsuitable for any analysis of the scattering properties and characterization. These results are in contrast to the reduced impact of noise on oil slicks detected by the L-band UAVSAR system. In particular, we find that there is no need to invoke exotic scattering mechanisms to explain the characteristics of the data. We also recommend a noise subtraction for any polarimetric scattering analysis.

The Gaia Ultra-Cool Dwarf Sample - III: seven new multiple systems containing at least one Gaia DR2 ultracool dwarf	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						binaries: visual; brown dwarfs; stars: individual: HD 164507; V478 Lyr; CD-28 8692, LT UMa; stars: low-mass	PROPER-MOTION SURVEY; LATE-TYPE STARS; BROWN DWARFS; T DWARFS; ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS; SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION; CANDIDATE BINARIES; SPEX SPECTROSCOPY; WIDE BINARIES; MASS FUNCTION	We present 10 new ultracool dwarfs in seven wide binary systems discovered using Gaia second data release data, identified as part of our Gaia Ultra-Cool Dwarf Sample project. The seven systems presented here include an L1 companion to the G5 IV star HD 164507, an L1: companion to the V478 Lyr AB system, an L2 companion to the metal-poor K5 V star CD-28 8692, an M9 V companion to the young variable K0 V star LT UMa, and three low-mass binaries consisting of late Ms and early Ls. The HD 164507, CD-28 8692, V478 Lyr, and LT UMa systems are particularly important benchmarks, because the primaries are well characterized and offer excellent constraints on the atmospheric parameters and ages of the companions. We find that the M8 V star 2MASS J23253550+4608163 is similar to 2.5 mag overluminous compared to M dwarfs of similar spectral type, but at the same time it does not exhibit obvious peculiarities in its near-infrared spectrum. Its overluminosity cannot be explained by unresolved binarity alone. Finally, we present an L1+L2 system with a projected physical separation of 959 au, making this the widest L + L binary currently known.	[Marocco, F.; Mamajek, E.

DES Collaboration	The mystery of photometric twins DES17X1boj and DES16E2bjy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						supernovae: general	STELLAR POPULATION SYNTHESIS; SN HUNT 248; K-CORRECTIONS; LINE SPECTRA; SUPERNOVAE; STAR; TRANSIENTS; OUTBURST; GALAXIES; 2009IP	We present an analysis of DES17X1boj and DES16E2bjy, two peculiar transients discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). They exhibit nearly identical double-peaked light curves that reach very different maximum luminosities (M-r = -15.4 and -17.9, respectively). The light-curve evolution of these events is highly atypical and has not been reported before. The transients are found in different host environments: DES17X1boj was found near the nucleus of a spiral galaxy, while DES16E2bjy is located in the outskirts of a passive red galaxy. Early photometric data are well fitted with a blackbody and the resulting moderate photospheric expansion velocities (1800 km s(-1) for DES17X1boj and 4800 km s(-1) for DES16E2bjy) suggest an explosive or eruptive origin. Additionally, a feature identified as high-velocity Ca II absorption (v approximate to 9400 km s(-1)) in the near-peak spectrum of DES17X1boj may imply that it is a supernova. While similar light-curve evolution suggests a similar physical origin for these two transients, we are not able to identify or characterize the progenitors.	[Pursiainen, M.; Gutierrez, C.

Thermal convection in the crust of the dwarf planet - I.

This feature is suggested by its relatively low bulk density (2162 kg m(-3)), while its partial differentiation into a rocky core and icy crust is suggested by several geological and geochemical features: minerals and salts produced by aqueous alteration, icy patches on the surface, and lobate morphology interpreted as surface flows. In this work, we explore how the composition can influence the characteristics of thermal convection in the crust of Ceres. Our results suggest that the onset of thermal convection is difficult and when it occurs, it is short lived, which could imply that Ceres preserved deep liquid until present, as recently suggested by the work of Castillo-Rogez et al. Moreover, cryovolcanism could be driven by diapirism (chemical convection) rather than thermal convection.	[Formisano, M.; Federico, C.; De Sanctis, M.

The unusual broad-band X-ray spectral variability of NGC1313 X-1 seen with XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual: NGC1313 X-1	SUPER-EDDINGTON ACCRETION; MASS BLACK-HOLES; NEUTRON-STAR; COHERENT PULSATIONS; DISCOVERY; PULSAR; MODEL; DISK; EMISSION; ULXS	We present results from the major coordinated X-ray observing programme on the ULX NGC1313 X-1 performed in 2017, combining XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR, focusing on the evolution of the broad-band (similar to 0.3-30.0 keV) continuum emission. Clear and unusual spectral variability is observed, but this is markedly suppressed above similar to 10-15 keV, qualitatively similar to the ULX Holmberg IX X-1. We model the multi-epoch data with two-component accretion disc models designed to approximate super-Eddington accretion, allowing for both a black hole and a neutron star accretor. With regards to the hotter disc component, the data trace out two distinct tracks in the luminosity-temperature plane, with larger emitting radii and lower temperatures seen at higher observed fluxes. Despite this apparent anticorrelation, each of these tracks individually shows a positive luminosity-temperature relation. Both are broadly consistent with L proportional to T-4, as expected for blackbody emission with a constant area, and also with L proportional to T-2, as may be expected for an advection-dominated disc around a black hole. We consider a variety of possibilities for this unusual behaviour. Scenarios in which the innermost flow is suddenly blocked from view by outer regions of the super-Eddington disc/wind can explain the luminosity-temperature behaviour, but are difficult to reconcile with the lack of strong variability at higher energies, assuming this emission arises from the most compact regions. Instead, we may be seeing evidence for further radial stratification of the accretion flow than is included in the simple models considered, with a combination of winds and advection resulting in the suppressed high-energy variability.

X-Ray Emission from Jupiter's Galilean Moons: A Tool for Determining Their Surface Composition and Particle Environment	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Chemical abundances; Impact phenomena; Spectroscopy; Non-thermal radiation sources; Galilean satellites; X-ray sources; Jupiter	IO; DISCOVERY; EUROPA; SULFUR	We analyze archival Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of Jupiter to search for emission from the Galilean moons. X-ray emission has previously been reported from Io and Europa using a subset of these data. We confirm this detection, and marginally detect X-ray emission from both Ganymede and Callisto as well. The X-ray spectrum of Europa is strongly peaked around the neutral oxygen fluorescence line (525 eV), while Io's has peaks at both oxygen and sulfur (2308 eV) plus a broad continuum between 350 and 5000 eV. Ganymede's spectrum is similar to Io's, but without the sulfur peak. A few events, mostly clustered around the oxygen line, are detected from Callisto. Using measurements by the Galileo mission of the specific intensity of ambient protons and electrons, we model the X-ray spectra and flux of the moons from two processes: particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) from the impact of energetic protons and X-ray emission from electron bremsstrahlung. With uncertainties of a factor of a few, the electron bremsstrahlung and PIXE models overestimate the X-ray flux from Europa, preventing us from making a definitive statement about the origin of the X-ray emission. The PIXE model of Io predicts emission lines at O and S similar to those observed, but underestimates their flux by nearly two orders of magnitude. Based on this discrepancy in the PIXE flux, combined with the detected broadband continuum in the spectrum, we conclude that the X-ray emission from Io is due to electron bremsstrahlung. Likewise, because of Ganymede's broad continuum, we tentatively conclude that its X-ray emission is also due to electron bremsstrahlung. Callisto is too faint in the X-rays to draw any conclusion. Obtaining in situ X-ray observations of the moons would provide a direct measurement of their elemental composition.

Specifically, the transit depth in the triplet feature (with vacuum wavelengths near 1083.3 nm) can be used to constrain the temperature and mass-loss rate of an exoplanet's upper atmosphere. Here, we present a new photometric technique to measure metastable 2(3)S helium absorption using an ultranarrowband filter (FWHM 0.635 nm) coupled to a beam-shaping diffuser installed in the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the 200 inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. We use telluric OH lines and a helium arc lamp to characterize refractive effects through the filter and to confirm our understanding of the filter transmission profile. We benchmark our new technique by observing a transit of WASP-69b and detect an excess absorption of 0.498% 0.045% (11.1 sigma), consistent with previous measurements after considering our bandpass. We then use this method to study the inflated gas giant WASP-52b and place a 95th percentile upper limit on excess absorption in our helium bandpass of 0.47%. Using an atmospheric escape model, we constrain the mass-loss rate for WASP-69b to be5.25(-0.46)(+0.65) x 10(-4) M-J Gyr(-1) (3.32(-0.56)(+0.67) x 10(-3) M-J Gyr(-1)) at 7000 K (12,000 K). Additionally, we set an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of WASP-52b at these temperatures of 2.1 x 10(-4) M-J Gy(r-1) (2.1 x 10(-3) M-J Gyr(-1)). These results show that ultranarrowband photometry can reliably quantify absorption in the metastable helium feature.

DES Collaboration	A joint SZ-X-ray-optical analysis of the dynamical state of 288 massive galaxy clusters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: luminosity function, mass function; galaxies: clusters: general	K-BAND PROPERTIES; DARK-MATTER; LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS; SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH; STELLAR MASS; MS 1054-03; MERGERS; OCCUPATION; EVOLUTION; MACS	We use imaging from the first three years of the Dark Energy Survey to characterize the dynamical state of 288 galaxy clusters at 0.1 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 0.9 detected in the South Pole Telescope (SPT) Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect survey (SPT-SZ). We examine spatial offsets between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the centre of the gas distribution as traced by the SPT-SZ centroid and by the X-ray centroid/peak position from Chandra and XMM data. We show that the radial distribution of offsets provides no evidence that SPT SZ-selected cluster samples include a higher fraction of mergers than X-ray-selected cluster samples. We use the offsets to classify the dynamical state of the clusters, selecting the 43 most disturbed clusters, with half of those at z greater than or similar to 0.5, a region seldom explored previously. We find that Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and relaxed clusters differ at z > 0.55 but not at lower redshifts. Disturbed clusters at z > 0.55 have steeper faint-end slopes and brighter characteristic magnitudes. Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in agreement in the lower redshift bin. Possible explanations includes a higher merger rate, and a more efficient dynamical friction at high redshift. The red-sequence population is less affected by the cluster dynamical state than the general galaxy population.	[Zenteno, A.; Hernandez-Lang, D.; Walker, A.

The effect of the cloud inhomogeneity on autoconversion rate is incorporated into the GCM as an enhancement factor using a prognostic cloud water probability density function (PDF), which is assumed to be a truncated skewed-triangle distribution based on the total water PDF originally implemented. The PDF assumption and the factor are evaluated against those obtained by global satellite observations and simulated by a global cloud-system-resolving model (GCRM). Results show that the factor implemented exerts latitudinal variations, with higher values at low latitudes, qualitatively consistent with satellite observations and the GCRM. The GCM thus validated for the subgrid cloud inhomogeneity is then used to investigate how the characteristics of the enhancement factor affect global climate through sensitivity experiments with and without the factor incorporated. The latitudinal variation of the factor is found to have a systematic impact that reduces the cloud water and the solar reflection at low latitudes in the manner that helps mitigate the too-reflective cloud bias common among GCMs over the tropical oceans. Due to the limitation of the factor arising from the PDF assumption, however, no significant impact is found in the warm rain formation process. Finally, it is shown that the functional form for the PDF in a GCM is crucial to properly characterize the observed cloud water inhomogeneity and its relationship with precipitation.

Double-junction GaInP/GaAs solar cells that may be able to operate and survive, with suitable encapsulation, for several weeks on the 465 degrees C Venus surface have been developed. These solar cells have been optimized for operation under the Venus solar spectrum, which is different from that of the Earth.

J	Wijesekara, RT; Gunapala, SD; Stockman, MI; Premaratne, M				Wijesekara, Ravi T.; Gunapala, Sarath D.; Stockman, Mark, I; Premaratne, Malin			Optically controlled quantum thermal gate	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							NANOSCALE	The ability to actively control heat flows in the nanoscale can open up a plethora of opportunities for applications that require thermal management and regulation. We show that it is possible to build a three-terminal quantum thermal gating device which regulates the thermal conductivity between two of its terminals in response to light incident upon the remaining terminal. We model our device as three mutually coupled two-level systems which interact thermally and optically with their environment. To incorporate the thermal interactions of our device, we adopt an open quantum systems framework under the Born-Markov approximation. We subsequently use detailed quantum mechanical state analysis to illustrate its operating principle. Through numerical simulations, we further explore the nonlinear relationship between the optical field amplitude and the thermal conductivity of the device in the steady-state regime. Based on our investigations, we find that the energy-gating behavior of our device is highly efficient in that it can control a significantly larger thermal energy flow compared to the amount of energy it absorbs from the optical field in the process. The approach we have taken to analyze the system, in particular the graphical representations we developed to intuitively and concisely represent the quantum states, energy flows, and the relationships between them, could be of value in analyzing other similar thermo-optical systems. Thus, we envision that both the device concept and its analysis technique would be useful to researchers working in this area.

We detected both PDS 70 b and c in our images, as well as the front rim of the circumstellar disk. After subtracting off a model of the disk, we measured the astrometry and photometry of both planets. Placing priors based on the dynamics of the system, we estimated PDS 70 b to have a semimajor axis of 20(-4)(+3) au and PDS 70 c to have a semimajor axis of 34(-6)(+12) au (95% credible interval). We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of both planets. For PDS 70 b, we were able to place better constraints on the red half of its SED than previous studies and inferred the radius of the photosphere to be 2-3 R-Jup. The SED of PDS 70 c is less well constrained, with a range of total luminosities spanning an order of magnitude. With our inferred radii and luminosities, we used evolutionary models of accreting protoplanets to derive a mass of PDS 70 b between 2 and 4 M-Jup and a mean mass accretion rate between 3 x 10(-7) and 8 x 10(-7) M-Jup/yr. For PDS 70 c, we computed a mass between 1 and 3 M-Jup and mean mass accretion rate between 1 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) M-Jup/yr. The mass accretion rates imply dust accretion timescales short enough to hide strong molecular absorption features in both planets' SEDs.

Therefore, obtaining an accurate and robust description of its properties is important. Recently, several attempts were made to improve the thermodynamic description of pure elements and binary systems in the frame of the third generation CALPHAD databases. Moreover, it became increasingly important to develop mathematical tools that can allow researchers more access to each phase of the material over the entire temperature range. Thus, the recently proposed segmented regression model was modified using the so-called sigmoid function for the case of pure Cr. A comprehensive analysis of phase equilibria and thermodynamic properties of pure Cr was used to develop an updated unary description from 0 K to 6000 K using the proposed modified segmented regression (MSR) model. In addition, two newly developed machine learning tools were utilized to analyze the datasets used in this assessment to determine any possible outliers.

Discovery of novel structures at 10.7 km depth in the Mariana Trench may reveal chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS			English	Article						Microbiology; Hadal; Mariana trench; Sirena deep	CHALLENGER DEEP; OCEAN; FIELD; EXOSKELETON; CHEMISTRY; VOLCANISM; ECOSYSTEM; PATTERNS; ARCHAEA	During an expedition in 2012 we recovered sediment, water, and biological samples from the inner slope of the Mariana Trench using a lander equipped with cameras, three twenty-liter Niskin bottles, a baited net trap, and a pressure calibrated depth sensor. Images and samples collected from the 10,677 m drop site reveal filamentous structures covering both talus and outcrop, which we cautiously identify as a microbial mat community. Analyses of retrieved sediments and images of the outcrop indicate that serpentinization of exposed ultramafic rock may be the source of the chemical energy needed to sustain this ecosystem. If true, this is the deepest known such community to be identified in Earth's ocean.	[Hand, K. P.; Williford, K.; Hofmann, A.

Traditionally, strain engineering studies focused on movement of oxygen ions at high temperatures (500 degrees C and above), complicating electrical properties by introducing mixed electronic and ionic conductivity. In this study, we demonstrate formation of oxygen vacancies and room temperature charge redistribution in a CeO2 thin film as a result of phase transformation in a localized region by mechanical deformation. Mechanical indentation of the CeO2 thin film at room temperature results in irreversible deformation. Conductive-tip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) analysis shows increased current passing through the locally deformed area of the CeO2 thin film. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis equipped with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) suggests that the increase in current contrast in the deformed region arises from an increased concentration of Ce3+ ions. We herein discuss the fundamental reason behind the increased amount of Ce3+ ions in the deformed area, based on the atomic scale computational works performed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analyses. Mechanical deformation not only facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies in a localized region, but also induces a phase transformation of cubic fluorite CeO2 into a newly formed T-CeO2 structure. These are considered as the critical factors for the enhanced current in the deformed CeO2 thin film at room temperature. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The radar's sensitivity is validated using a calibration target, and its remote sensing capabilities are demonstrated through the detection of clouds, rain, insects, and distant vehicles. The radar uses a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) waveform, a single antenna with ultra-high-isolation quasioptical transmit/receive duplexing, an InP low-noise amplifier for receiving, and a GaN power amplifier for transmitting. A DC power consumption of 22 W for the RF and digital subsystems is achieved, in part, by a combination of a power-efficient waveform generation/detection and signal processing board and a CMOS-based system-on-chip W-band oscillator. Excluding power supplies and a computer interface, the radar system mass is under 6 kg, making it attractive for future deployment from platforms with constrained accommodation resources.

The disk is detected in total and polarized intensity down to a projected angular separation of 015, or 20 au. On the other hand, the large-scale swept-back halo remains undetected, likely a consequence of its markedly blue color relative to the parent body belt. We analyze the curvature of the disk spine and estimate a radius of 100 au for the parent body belt, smaller than past scattered light studies but consistent with thermal emission maps of the system. We employ three different flux-preserving post-processing methods to suppress the residual starlight and evaluate the surface brightness and polarization profile along the disk spine. Unlike past studies of the system, our high-fidelity images reveal the disk to be highly symmetric and devoid of morphological and surface brightness perturbations. We find the dust scattering properties of the system to be consistent with those observed in other debris disks, with the exception of HR 4796. Finally, we find no direct evidence for the presence of a planetary-mass object in the system.

HD 165054 is a bright star within Baade's Window, a region of the galactic plane with relatively low extinction from interstellar dust. HD 165054 was selected as a calibrator target due to the high number density of stars within this region (similar to 3 stars per square arcsecond with H < 22), necessary because of the small field of view of the GPI. Using nine epochs spanning over five years, we have fit a standard five-parameter astrometric model to the astrometry of seven background stars within close proximity to HD 165054 (rho < 2 ''). We achieved a proper motion precision of similar to 0.3 mas yr(-1) and constrained the parallax of each star to be less than or similar to 1 mas. Our measured proper motions and parallax limits are consistent with the background stars being a part of the galactic bulge. Using these measurements, we find no evidence of any systematic trend of either the plate scale or the north angle offset of GPI between 2014 and 2019. We compared our model describing the motions of the seven background stars to observations of the same field in 2014 and 2018 obtained with Keck/NIRC2, an instrument with excellent astrometric calibration. We find that the predicted position of the background sources is consistent with that measured by NIRC2, within the uncertainties of the calibration of the two instruments. In the future, we will use this field as a standard astrometric calibrator for the upgrade of GPI and potentially for other high-contrast imagers.

TESS Reveals HD 118203 b to be a Transiting Planet	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet astronomy; Exoplanet systems; Transit photometry	METALLICITY-BIASED SEARCH; EXTRASOLAR PLANETS; ERROR-CORRECTION; HOT JUPITERS; PARENT STARS; KEPLER; ELODIE; DETECTABILITY; PARAMETERS; TRENDS	The exoplanet HD.118203 b, orbiting a bright (V.=.8.05) host star, was discovered using the radial velocity method by da Silva et al., but was not previously known to transit. Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry has revealed that this planet transits its host star. Nine planetary transits were observed by TESS, allowing us to measure the radius of the planet to be 1.136(-0.028)(+0.029)R(J), and to calculate the planet mass to be 2.166(-0.079)(+0.074)M(J). The host star is slightly evolved with an effective temperature of T-eff = 5683(-85)(+84) K and a surface gravity of log g = 3.889(0.018)(0.017). With an orbital period of 6.134985(-0.000030)(+0.000029) days and an eccentricity of 0.314.+/-.0.017, the planet occupies a transitional regime between circularized hot Jupiters and more dynamically active planets at longer orbital periods. The host star is among the 10 brightest known to have transiting giant planets, providing opportunities for both planetary atmospheric and asteroseismic studies.

Synthetic Tracking Using ZTF Deep Drilling Data Sets	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						astronomical object indentification; astronomy data analysis; astronomy data reduction; detection; GPU computing		The Zwicky Transit Facility (ZTF) is a powerful time domain survey telescope with a large field of view of 47 deg2. We apply the synthetic tracking technique to integrate a ZTF's deep drilling data set, which consists of 133 nominal 30 s exposure frames spanning about 1.5 hr, to search for slowly moving asteroids down to approximately 23rd magnitude. We found 1168 objects from searching 40 of the 64 CCD-quadrant subfields, each of which covers a field size of about 0.73 deg2. While most of the objects are in the core region of the asteroid belt, there are asteroids belonging to families of Trojan, Hilda, Hungaria, Phocaea, and near-Earth-asteroids.

Ridged plains on Europa reveal a compressive past	ICARUS			English	Article						Europa; Geological processes; Tectonics; Thermal histories; Experimental techniques	ICE SHELL; GALILEAN SATELLITES; SUBSURFACE OCEAN; HIGH-RESOLUTION; DARK TERRAIN; THICKNESS; GANYMEDE; MODELS; CHAOS; WATER	Europa's young surface implies relatively recent resurfacing. Ridged plains, which make up >50% of Europa's surface, have not yet been fully analyzed for a potential formation mechanism. Because ridged plains dominate Europa's surface, this terrain is key to understanding how Europa has resurfaced and how the resurfacing mechanisms may have evolved through time. In this work, we create a new high-resolution topographic model and a two-layer physical analog model to investigate the formation of ridged plains. We find that the ridged plains most closely resemble the compressional physical analog experiments which generate folds. Specifically, the analog experiments with a brittle layer <1/16th the thickness of the underlying ductile-layer best explain the morphological observations of the ridged plains on Europa. Based on the scaling relationships, we find that at the time of the ridged plains formation, the brittle part of the ice shell of Europa's ice shell was similar to 200 m thick and the total ice-shell thickness, including both the ductile and brittle parts, was >similar to 3000 m. Compared to the predicted current ice shell thickness, this would imply that Europa's ice-shell has thickened through the visible surface history.	[Leonard, E.

The model's 2 m temperatures were close to the observed values. Relative humidity (RH) is very low during the day but at night RH at 2 m reaches nearly 100% by the Zent et al. (2016) recalibration (Z), and 60-70% by the Fischer et al. (2019) recalibration (F). Model values of RH2m are close to Z and F at night and to F during the day. All three imply low water vapor pressures near the surface at night, 0.03-0.05 Pa, with a rapid increase each morning to 0.3-1 Pa and a decrease in the evening by both F and the model simulation. The model's daily adsorbed and desorbed water is in balance for regolith porosity of 16% (instead of 35% for lower latitudes). The depleted layer of nighttime air moisture extends to only about 200 m above the surface; hence the model's precipitable water content stays around the observed similar to 30 mu m throughout the sol. The model's moisture cycle is not sensitive to tortuosity of the regolith but the in-pore molecular diffusivity should be at least 5 cm(2)/s for fair agreement with the observations. In the adsorption experiments there is no fog and just a hint of ground frost, as observed during this period. Strong night frosts appear if adsorption is made weak or absent in the model.

The surface roughness of Europa derived from Galileo stereo images	ICARUS			English	Article							KILOMETER-SCALE; ICE SHELL; TOPOGRAPHIC ROUGHNESS; SUBSURFACE OCEAN; IMPACT FEATURES; MARS; MERCURY; CHAOS; WATER; PERFORMANCE	We assess the surface roughness of Europa by reevaluating Galileo stereo images. Roughness provides important information about surface textures, which are related to geologic processes operating at a variety of scales. Roughness also sets important performance requirements for various remote sensing instruments on board the upcoming icy satellite missions to the Jovian System. In this study, roughness is derived for different geologic terrains on Europa, which have been distinguished through geomorphological mapping. For each terrain type we derive the scale dependent root-mean-square roughness and corresponding Hurst exponents. We investigate the scale between 30 m and 5 km and show that Europa's surface can mostly be described by a monofractal behavior over these baselines (i.e., surface roughness follows power laws with breakpoints located at a few hundred meters). Hurst exponents are higher below the breakpoints with typical values between 0.4 and 0.8 and lower above, typically between 0.2 and 0.6. This behavior is mostly controlled by ridges which are dominating the topography on Europa. At unity scale (1 m) roughness is extrapolated to be around 0.4-0.7 m with strong exceptions on chaos terrain where values over 1-2 m can be achieved, assuming that no further breakpoints are present below the resolution of the digital terrain models used in this study.

We examined 16 mid-afternoon observations spanning L-s = 97.5 degrees-148 degrees. We developed a 2-layer model of vapor distribution which reproduces the water vapor band depth. Using the results of the 2-layer model, we retrieved the mass mixing ratios in each layer and the implied surface vapor pressure. We found that near surface water vapor was enhanced relative to higher layers, resulting in a large percentage of the water column (>25% and up to nearly 100%) confined below similar to 2.5 km.

In the new analysis, we add full-disk photometry of Jupiter and the Saturnian icy satellites Rhea, Dione and Enceladus to the previous measurements, which had consisted primarily of standard star targets, while the stellar photometry is updated to include a correction for light lost to the extended wings of the instrumental point spread function. The resulting absolute flux corrections differ considerably from those previously reported, shifting measured radiance by close to 10% in most broadband filters, and bringing agreement between star and satellite targets to within 3%. We also detail improvements to the narrow-angle camera flat field correction, and provide updates to the filter-by-filter point spread functions, hot pixel correction, and polarizer calibration. For the latter, we present new measurements of Titan's polarization from near-UV to near-IR, including three methane bands and nearby spectral windows.

In light of this knowledge gap, several upcoming spaceborne missions aim to map forest aboveground biomass, and many new biomass products are expected from these datasets. As these new missions host different technologies, each with relative strengths and weaknesses for biomass retrieval, as well as different spatial resolutions, consistently comparing or combining biomass estimates from these new datasets will be challenging. This paper presents a demonstration of an inter-comparison of biomass estimates from simulations of three NASA missions (GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR) over Sonoma county in California, USA. We use a high resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar map as our reference dataset, and emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties in both reference maps and spaceborne estimates when conducting biomass product validation. GEDI and ICESat-2 were simulated from airborne lidar point clouds, while UAVSAR's L-band backscatter was used as a proxy for NISAR. To estimate biomass for the lidar missions we used GEDI's footprint-level biomass algorithms, and also adapted these for application to ICESat-2. For UAVSAR, we developed a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS reference map. Each mission simulation was evaluated in comparison to the local reference map at its native product resolution (25 m, 100 m transect, and 1 ha) yielding RMSEs of 57%, 75%, and 89% for GEDI, NISAR, and ICESat-2 respectively. RMSE values increased for GEDI's power beam during simulated daytime conditions (64%), coverage beam during nighttime conditions (72%), and coverage beam daytime conditions (87%). We also test the application of GEDI's biomass modeling framework for estimation of biomass from ICESat-2, and find that ICESat-2 yields reasonable biomass estimates, particularly in relatively short, open canopies. Results suggest that while all three missions will produce datasets useful for biomass mapping, tall, dense canopies such as those found in Sonoma County present the greatest challenges for all three missions, while steep slopes also prove challenging for single-date SAR-based biomass retrievals. Our methods provide guidance for the inter-comparison and validation of spaceborne biomass estimates through the use of airborne lidar reference maps, and could be repeated with on-orbit estimates in any area with high quality field plot and ALS data. These methods allow for regional interpretations and filtering of multi-mission biomass estimates toward improved wall-to-wall biomass maps through data fusion.

Combining hyper-resolution land surface modeling with SMAP brightness temperatures to obtain 30-m soil moisture estimates	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land surface modeling; Data merging; Soil moisture; Brightness temperature; Hyper-resolution; Field-scale; SMAP	DATA ASSIMILATION; WATER-RESOURCES; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; RETRIEVALS; VALIDATION; PRODUCTS; HETEROGENEITY; PRECIPITATION; CALIBRATION	Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales. Our results highlight the value of hyper-resolution modeling to bridge the gap between coarse-scale satellite retrievals and field-scale hydrological applications.

Remote sensing of angular scattering effect of aerosols in a North American megacity	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerosol scattering; Angular dependence; Urban remote sensing; Megacity; CLARS	LOS-ANGELES; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; GREENHOUSE GASES; CLARS-FTS; CO2; CH4; SENSITIVITY; VALIDATION; RADIANCE; IMPACT	The angle-dependent scattering effect of aerosols in the atmosphere not only influences climate through radiative forcing effects but also impacts trace gas remote sensing by modifying the path of radiation through the atmosphere. The aerosol phase function, which characterizes the angular signature of scattering, has been continuously monitored from ground-based and space-borne observations. However, the range of scattering angles these instruments can sample is very limited. Here, we report multi-year measurements from a mountain-top remote sensing instrument: the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS), which overlooks the Los Angeles megacity. The observational geometries of CLARS-FTS provide a wide range of scattering angles, from about 20 degrees (forward) to about 140 degrees (backward), which is larger than the range provided by any existing aerosol remote sensing instrument. We then quantify the aerosol angular scattering effect using the O-2 ratio, which is the ratio of retrieved O-2 Slant Column Density (SCD) to geometric O-2 SCD. The O-2 ratio quantifies the light path modification due to aerosol scattering, with a value of 1 representing an aerosol-free scenario. The lower the O-2 ratio value than 1, the stronger the aerosol loading. CLARS-FTS measurements are highly sensitive to the angular scattering effect of aerosols in the Los Angeles (LA) urban atmosphere, due to the long light path going through the boundary layer and the wide range of observational angles. The differences in aerosol scattering between different surface reflection points targeted by CLARS-FTS can be explained by differences in their angular scattering geometries. The correlation between measurements at different targets can be used to quantify the strength of the angular dependence of the aerosol phase function. Applying the correlation technique to CLARS-FTS measurements, we find that, from 2011 to 2018, there is no significant trend in the aerosol phase function in the LA megacity. Overall, this study provides a practical observing strategy for quantifying the angular dependence of aerosol scattering in urban atmospheres that could potentially contribute towards improved greenhouse gas remote sensing in megacities.

To date, prevention and mitigation of hypoxia has centered on nutrient reduction to prevent eutrophication. However, nutrient reduction is often slow and sometimes insufficient to remedy hypoxia. We investigate the utility of a complementary strategy of pumping oxygenated surface water to depth, termed induced downwelling, as a technique to remedy hypoxia in the bottom water of marine and freshwater ecosystems. We introduce simple energy-based models and apply them to depth profiles in hypoxic estuaries, lakes, and freshwater reservoirs. Our models indicate that induced downwelling may be similar to 3 to 10(2) times more efficient than bubbling air, and 10(4) to 10(6) times more efficient than fountain aerators, at oxygenating hypoxic bottom waters. A proof-of-concept downwelling field experiment highlighted potential advantages and shortcomings. We estimate that regional-scale downwelling for continual hypoxia avoidance would require 0.4 to 4 megawatts per cubic kilometer of water (depending on local conditions), or 50 to 500 US dollars per hour per cubic kilometer of water (assuming 125 USD MWh(-1) of electricity). Many potential side effects of downwelling are discussed, each of which would need to be explored and assessed before implementation. Downwelling does not replace nutrient management strategies, but under some circumstances may provide an efficient means to augment these strategies. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Monitoring of Dust Devil Tracks Around the InSight Landing Site, Mars, and Comparison With In Situ Atmospheric Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						dust devil tracks; Mars; InSight mission; HiRISE images	MOTION; DIRECTIONS	The NASA InSight mission on Mars is a unique opportunity to study atmospheric processes both from orbit and in situ observations. We use post-landing high-resolution satellite images to monitor dust devil activity during the first 8 months of the mission. We perform mapping and semiautomatic detection of newly formed dust devil tracks and analyze their characteristics (sizes, azimuths, distances, and directions of motion). We find a large number of tracks appearing shortly after landing, followed by a significant decrease of activity during late winter, then a progressive increase during early spring. New tracks are characterized by dark linear, to slightly curvilinear, traces ranging from a few to more than 10 m wide. Tracks are oriented in the ambient wind direction, according to measurements made by InSight's meteorological sensors. The systematic analysis of dust devil tracks is useful to have a better understanding of atmospheric and aeolian activity around InSight. Plain Language Summary The NASA InSight mission landed on Mars in November 2018. It carries weather and seismic stations that are now working continuously. We are also able to observe the InSight region from orbit using high-resolution satellite images that have been acquired regularly over the first year of the InSight mission. They show a lot of dark traces on the surface, which are caused by whirlwinds called dust devils raising dust into the air. This phenomenon is not observed at the same rate over the entire year, as it depends on atmospheric conditions that vary with season. Our study with satellite images allows us to understand the characteristics of dust devil tracks and compare them with related measurements from the weather station on board InSight. These two sets of observations are well correlated to each other and provide significant constraints to better characterize the atmospheric activity around InSight and in the region of Elysium Planitia, Mars.

Similar oscillations were also found in buoy data at different locations around the globe and in an atmospheric reanalysis, albeit the oscillations were noisier and stronger in the observations, and they were weaker and longer period in the atmospheric reanalysis. These oscillations did not, however, develop in an atmosphere-only simulation, suggesting the importance of ocean-atmosphere coupling for simulating this phenomenon. We propose a mechanism for this interaction involving a feedback between SST and surface wind.

Conference Report	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mars extant life; Biosignatures; Life detection; Astrobiology; Life in extreme environments	VIKING BIOLOGY EXPERIMENTS; MARTIAN SOIL; HYDROCARBON GASES; H-2 PRODUCTION; SURFACE; WATER; DEEP; ICE; SEARCH; ORIGIN	On November 5-8, 2019, the "Mars Extant Life: What's Next?" conference was convened in Carlsbad, New Mexico. The conference gathered a community of actively publishing experts in disciplines related to habitability and astrobiology. Primary conclusions are as follows: A significant subset of conference attendees concluded that there is a realistic possibility that Mars hosts indigenous microbial life. A powerful theme that permeated the conference is that the key to the search for martian extant life lies in identifying and exploring refugia ("oases"), where conditions are either permanently or episodically significantly more hospitable than average. Based on our existing knowledge of Mars, conference participants highlighted four potential martian refugium (not listed in priority order): Caves, Deep Subsurface, Ices, and Salts. The conference group did not attempt to reach a consensus prioritization of these candidate environments, but instead felt that a defensible prioritization would require a future competitive process. Within the context of these candidate environments, we identified a variety of geological search strategies that could narrow the search space. Additionally, we summarized a number of measurement techniques that could be used to detect evidence of extant life (if present). Again, it was not within the scope of the conference to prioritize these measurement techniques-that is best left for the competitive process. We specifically note that the number and sensitivity of detection methods that could be implemented if samples were returned to Earth greatly exceed the methodologies that could be used at Mars. Finally, important lessons to guide extant life search processes can be derived both from experiments carried out in terrestrial laboratories and analog field sites and from theoretical modeling.

Fluvial Regimes, Morphometry, and Age of Jezero Crater Paleolake Inlet Valleys and Their Exobiological Significance for the 2020 Rover Mission Landing Site	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mars; Perseverance rover; Landing site; HiRISE; HRSC; Fluvial landforms	OUTFLOW CHANNELS; NAVUA VALLES; MARTIAN VALLEYS; MARS; GROUNDWATER; ORIGIN; DEPOSITS; SYSTEM; EVOLUTION; NETWORKS	Jezero crater has been selected as the landing site for the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover, because it contains a paleolake with two fan-deltas, inlet and outlet valleys. Using the data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE), we conducted a quantitative geomorphological study of the inlet valleys of the Jezero paleolake. Results show that the strongest erosion is related to a network of deep valleys that cut into the highland bedrock well upstream of the Jezero crater and likely formed before the formation of the regional olivine-rich unit. In contrast, the lower sections of valleys display poor bedrock erosion and a lack of tributaries but are characterized by the presence of pristine landforms interpreted as fluvial bars from preserved channels, the discharge rates of which have been estimated at 10(3)-10(4) m(3)s(-1). The valleys' lower sections postdate the olivine-rich unit, are linked directly to the fan-deltas, and are thus formed in an energetic, late stage of activity. Although a Late Noachian age for the fan-deltas' formation is not excluded based on crosscutting relationships and crater counts, this indicates evidence of a Hesperian age with significant implications for exobiology.

The unique electron structure provided by alkaline-earth atoms makes it a promising platform for various quantum-technology-based applications. Trapped neutral atoms have become a prominent platform for quantum science, where entanglement fidelity records have been set using highly excited Rydberg states. However, controlled two-qubit entanglement generation has so far been limited to alkali species, leaving the exploitation of more complex electronic structures as an open frontier that could lead to improved fidelities and fundamentally different applications such as quantum-enhanced optical clocks. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach utilizing the two-valence electron structure of individual alkaline-earth Rydberg atoms. We find fidelities for Rydberg state detection, single-atom Rabi operations and two-atom entanglement that surpass previously published values. Our results pave the way for novel applications, including programmable quantum metrology and hybrid atom-ion systems, and set the stage for alkaline-earth based quantum computing architectures.

J	Guan, B; Waliser, DE; Ralph, FM				Guan, Bin; Waliser, Duane E.; Ralph, F. Martin			A multimodel evaluation of the water vapor budget in atmospheric rivers	ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES			English	Article						atmospheric river; water vapor budget; reanalysis; model evaluation	ERA-INTERIM REANALYSIS; WEST-COAST; CLIMATE; MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION; TRANSITION; SATELLITE; ALGORITHM; TRANSPORT; FORECASTS	Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow regions of strong horizontal water vapor transport that play important roles in the global water cycle, weather, and hydrology. Motivated by challenges in simulating ARs with state-of-the-art global models, this paper diagnoses model errors with a focus on relative contributions of moisture convergence, evaporation, and precipitation to AR column-integrated water vapor (IWV) budget. Using 20-year simulations by 24 global weather/climate models, budget terms are calculated for four AR sectors: postfrontal, frontal, prefrontal, and pre-AR, with biases assessed against two reanalysis products. The results indicate that each sector is unique in terms of the dominant water vapor balance, and that the terms exhibiting the largest intermodel spread are the same terms dominating the water vapor balance in each sector. Overall, simulated bulk AR characteristics (e.g., geometry, frequency, and intensity) are more sensitive to biases in IVT convergence and IWV tendency than to biases in evaporation and precipitation, although evaporation/precipitation biases do affect key AR bulk characteristics in selected sectors. The large intermodel spread (particularly for precipitation) and, in certain cases, discrepancies between the reanalysis references themselves (particularly for precipitation types) highlight the need for observational efforts that target better constraining AR processes in weather/climate models and reanalyses.

Investigation of WRF's ability to simulate the monsoon-related seasonal variability in the thermodynamics and precipitation over southern peninsular India	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						QuikSCAT; Indian summer monsoon; Meteorological parameters; Surface precipitation; Simulation; TRMM; NCEP; WRF	ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; HEAT-FLUX ANOMALIES; CONVECTIVE PARAMETERIZATION; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; MODELING SYSTEM; NORTHERN OCEANS; RAINFALL EVENT; CIRCULATION; SENSITIVITY	The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of the state-of-the-art, higher-resolution, convection-permitting, weather research forecasting (WRF) model in predicting the changes in precipitation regimes which come in response to the seasonal changes in the large-scale environmental forcing. The simulation days are selected in the year 2009 and according to four environmental regimes defined by the daily flow direction (Ragi et al. (IEEE Trans Geosci Remote Sens 55:3466-3474, 2017)) using QuikSCAT scatterometer and the comparison of the same with National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) final analysis (FNL) data. The observations used for analysis are from Indian Meteorological Department, Wyoming, TRMM satellite data, and NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. This study finds that WRF is capable of reproducing the season-specific differences in the precipitating patterns that reflect the different phases of the monsoon. Extensive comparisons to observations point out that the model simulates reasonably well the temperature and the humidity fields, including their diurnal variability and vertical structure. However, the model-produced precipitation and winds do not compare so well, especially the winds. The simulated large-scale monsoon circulation and rainfall patterns indicate a wet bias in the model rainfall simulations than the TRMM rainfall observations over the selected region. In particular, WRF overestimates the rain. The base variables such as outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), latent and sensible heat fluxes, and convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition energy (CIN) are nearly in agreement with the observations. In effect, WRF is skilled to represent the variability in different seasons and its spatial distribution, an important characteristic of the precipitation, especially concerning prediction of the monsoon onset. The disagreements between the observed and the model precipitation and winds can be due to the WRF model physics which generates different dynamics and different precipitating systems and initial conditions.

Modeling the Carbon Cost of Plant Nitrogen and Phosphorus Uptake Across Temperate and Tropical Forests	FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE			English	Article						earth system model; mycorrhizae; plant-soil interactions; nutrient limitation; optimal allocation	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; TERRESTRIAL CARBON; CO2 FERTILIZATION; CYCLE MODELS; RAIN-FORESTS; PATTERNS; AVAILABILITY; ACQUISITION; DEPOSITION	Nutrient limitation is a key source of uncertainty in predicting terrestrial carbon (C) uptake. Models have begun to include nitrogen (N) dynamics; however, phosphorus (P), which can also limit or colimit net primary production in many ecosystems, is currently absent in most models. To meet this challenge, we integrated P dynamics into a cutting-edge plant nutrient uptake model (Fixation and Uptake of Nitrogen: FUN 2.0) that mechanistically tracks the C cost of N uptake from soil based on the cost of allocating C to leaf resorption and root/root-microbial uptake and the availability of N in soil. We incorporated the direct C cost of P uptake, as well as an N cost of synthesizing phosphatase enzymes to extract P from soil, into a new model formulation (FUN 3.0). We confronted and validated FUN 3.0 against empirical estimates of canopy, root, and soil P pools from 45 temperate forest plots in Indiana, USA, and 18 tropical dry forest plots located in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, that vary in P availability and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associated trees. FUN 3.0 was able to accurately predict N and P retranslocation across the temperate and tropical forest sites (slopes of 0.95 and 0.92 for P and N retranslocation, respectively). Carbon costs for acquiring P were three times higher in tropical forest sites compared to temperate forest sites, driving overall higher C costs in tropical sites. In addition, the N costs for acquiring P in tropical forest sites lead to a substantial increase in N fixation to support phosphatase enzyme production. Sensitivity analyses showed that tropical sites appeared to be severely P limited, while the temperate sites showed evidence for co-limitation by N and P. Collectively, FUN 3.0 provides a novel framework for predicting coupled N and P limitation that earth system models can leverage to enhance predictions of ecosystem response to global change.

The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-gamma-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.	[Romsdahl, Jillian; Blachowicz, Adriana; Chiang, Yi-Ming; Wang, Clay C.

Type IIn supernova light-curve properties measured from an untargeted survey sample	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						supernovae: general	CORE-COLLAPSE SUPERNOVAE; SN 2009IP; INTERACTING SUPERNOVAE; OPTICAL-SPECTRA; LEGACY SURVEY; 2012 OUTBURST; UGC 2773-OT; MASS-LOSS; STAR; SPECTROSCOPY	The evolution of a Type IIn supernova (SN IIn) is governed by the interaction between the SN ejecta and a hydrogen-rich circumstellar medium. The SNe IIn thus allow us to probe the late-time mass-loss history of their progenitor stars. We present a sample of SNe IIn from the untargeted, magnitude-limited surveys of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its successor, the intermediate PTF (iPTF). To date, statistics on SN IIn optical light-curve properties have generally been based on small (less than or similar to 10 SNe) samples from targeted SN surveys. The SNe IIn found and followed by the PTF/iPTF were used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints on the rise times as well as with available post-peak photometry. The sample SNe were discovered in 2009-2016 and have at least one low-resolution classification spectrum, as well as photometry from the P48 and P60 telescopes at Palomar Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these SNe IIn using spline fits (for the peak and the declining portion) and template matching (for the rising portion). We study the peak-magnitude distribution, rise times, decline rates, colour evolution, host galaxies, and K-corrections of the SNe in our sample. We find that the typical rise times are divided into fast and slow risers at 20 +/- 6 d and 50 +/- 11 d, respectively. The decline rates are possibly divided into two clusters (with slopes 0.013 +/- 0.006 mag d(-1) and 0.040 +/- 0.010 mag d(-1)), but this division has weak statistical significance. We find no significant correlation between the peak luminosity of SNe IIn and their rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn are generally found to be more long-lasting. Slowly rising SNe IIn are generally found to decline slowly. The SNe in our sample were hosted by galaxies of absolute magnitude -22 less than or similar to M-g less than or similar to-13 mag. The K-corrections at light-curve peak of the SNe IIn in our sample are found to be within 0.2 mag for the observer's frame r-band, for SNe at redshifts z< 0.25. By applying K-corrections and also including ostensibly "superluminous" SNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are M-peak(r) = -19.18 +/- 1.32 mag. We conclude that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve bumps in SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z, are limited to 1.4(-1.0)(+14.6)% of the SNe IIn. We also investigate a possible sub-type of SNe IIn with a fast rise to a greater than or similar to 50 d plateau followed by a slow, linear decline.

Uniquely, the material quality is optimal when InP is grown at 300 degrees C, a temperature which is low enough to enable back-end-of-line growth on fully fabricated Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor circuits. Using this low-temperature grown InP, a transistor fabrication process is then entirely carried out at 300 degrees C or below, and an indium phosphide nanoribbon field effect transistor with excellent on/off ratios is demonstrated, indicating low defect density in the material. Overall, this approach enables growth of large area (tens of micron) single crystal compound semiconductor at low temperatures, establishing a back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible process for monolithic 3D device integration.

Continuity of the Mass Loss of the World's Glaciers and Ice Caps From the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On Missions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						gravity; glacier; sea level; climate model; hydrology; freshwater	SEA-LEVEL RISE; TIME-VARIABLE GRAVITY; ARCTIC GLACIERS; BALANCE; CLIMATE; ARCHIPELAGO; VARIABILITY; GREENLAND; SVALBARD; ICELAND	We use time series of time-variable gravity from the Gravitational Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions to evaluate the mass balance of the world's glaciers and ice caps (GIC) for the time period April 2002 to September 2019, excluding Antarctica and Greenland peripheral glaciers. We demonstrate continuity of the mass balance record across the GRACE/GRACE-FO data gap using independent data from the GMAO Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis. We report an average mass loss of 281.5 +/- 30 Gt/yr, an acceleration of 50 +/- 20 Gt/yr per decade, and a 13-mm cumulative sea level rise for the analyzed period. Seven regions dominate the mass loss, with the largest share from the Arctic: Alaska (72.5 +/- 8 Gt/yr), Canadian Arctic Archipelago (73.0 +/- 9 Gt/yr), Southern Andes (30.4 +/- 13 Gt/yr), High Mountain Asia (HMA) (28.8 +/- 11 Gt/yr), Russian Arctic (20.2 +/- 6 Gt/yr), Iceland (15.9 +/- 4 Gt/yr), and Svalbard (12.1 +/- 4 Gt/yr). At the regional level, the analysis of acceleration is complicated by a strong interannual to decadal variability in mass balance that is well reproduced by the GRACE-calibrated MERRA-2 data.

Rapid Expansion and Evolution of a Regional Dust Storm in the Acidalia Corridor During the Initial Growth Phase of the Martian Global Dust Storm of 2018	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; Mars atmosphere; Mars Climate Sounder; MCS; global dust storm; orbit-spin coupling	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; DEEP CONVECTION; MARS; ATMOSPHERE; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; LAYERS	A vigorous regional dust storm substantially altered both the global atmospheric thermal structure and the magnitude and spatial distribution of dust loading within the Mars atmosphere between 1 and 9 June 2018. We examine the development and decay of this storm in latitude, longitude, altitude, and time, employing observations by the Mars Climate Sounder on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Dust layer top altitudes rose from seasonal-normal values of similar to 40 to similar to 70 km. Dust lofting to high altitudes was localized between 0 degrees and similar to 60 degrees W longitude, and between 60 degrees N and 60 degrees S latitude. Intensification of paired meridional overturning circulation cells within the study area is confirmed by strong nighttime dynamical heating in higher latitudes of both hemispheres. By the end of this episode, significant dust loading was present at altitudes greater than 50 km above all longitudes on Mars, and other dust lifting centers had been activated.	[Shirley, J.

Surface Warming During the 2018/Mars Year 34 Global Dust Storm	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Mars; Mars atmosphere; dust storm; data assimilation; Mars Climate Sounder	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; DATA ASSIMILATION; THERMAL INERTIA; MARS; CIRCULATION; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; CAP	The impact of Mars's 2018 Global Dust Storm (GDS) on surface and near-surface air temperatures was investigated using an assimilation of Mars Climate Sounder observations. Rather than simply resulting in cooling everywhere from solar absorption (average surface radiative flux fell 26 W/m(2)), the globally averaged result was a 0.9-K surface warming. These diurnally averaged surface temperature changes had a novel, highly nonuniform spatial structure, with up to 16-K cooling/19-K warming. Net warming occurred in low thermal inertia regions, where rapid nighttime radiative cooling was compensated by increased longwave emission and scattering. This caused strong nightside warming, outweighing dayside cooling. The reduced surface-air temperature gradient closely coupled surface and air temperatures, even causing local dayside air warming. Results show good agreement with Mars Climate Sounder surface temperature retrievals. Comparisons with the 2001 GDS and free-running simulations show that GDS spatial structure is crucial in determining global surface temperature effects.

New images of the linear polarization substructure in the nuclear region are presented, characterized by a two-component pattern of polarized intensity and smooth rotation of the polarization plane around the 43 GHz core. From a comparison with an analogous dataset from 2007, we find that this global polarization pattern remains stable on a time interval of 11 yr, while showing smaller month-scale variability. We discuss the possible Faraday rotation toward the M87 nucleus at centimeter to millimeter wavelengths. These results can be interpreted in a scenario where the observed polarimetric pattern is associated with the magnetic structure in the confining magnetohydrodynamic wind, which also serves as the source of the observed Faraday rotation.

These instruments are intended to calibrate astronomical spectrographs in radial velocity searches for extrasolar planets. By tracking the frequency drift of three widely-separated resonances in each FP, we measure fractional frequency drift rates as low as 1 x 10(-10) day(-1). However, we find that the fractional drift rate varies across the three sample wavelengths, such that the drift of two given resonance modes disagrees with the ratio of their mode numbers. We explore possible causes of this behavior, as well as quantify the temperature and optical power sensitivity of the FPs. Our results demonstrate the advancement of Fabry-Perot interferometers as robust and frequency-stable calibrators for astronomical and other broad bandwidth spectroscopy applications, but also highlight the need for chromatic characterization of these systems.

Design and Verification of the Feet Design used for the "Heat Flow Property Package Instrument" (HP3) on-board the Mars Mission InSight	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						InSight; Heat Flow Property Package (HP3); Foot Design; German Aerospace Center (DLR); Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)		The HP3 instrument measures the thermal flux through the Martian crust using a penetration probe. Launched on the InSight mission in 2018, HP3 was deployed for penetration activities in the beginning of 2019. During initial operation, the instrument is vulnerable to slip, due to a combination of low system mass (3.3 kg on Earth), shocks delivered by the penetration probe's action, and the possibility of an inclined attitude on the surface. An uncontrolled position change of the instrument on the surface can reduce the scientific output and even lead to a loss of the experiment if the probe's supporting structure moves laterally. Naturally, the design of the feet has major impact on the total amount of slippage. A new design for the feet with a high slippage resistance capability at a low level of complexity and mass was developed for this instrument's supporting structure. The design provides sufficient slippage resistance while fulfilling the challenging set of requirements for a Mars surface mission. The design was verified by test campaigns which emulate launch environments and operational behavior on Mars. This paper gives a detailed overview of the HP3 instrument itself, the relevant requirements, the complex different test campaigns and the final flight design. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

The electromotive force (EMF) response, stability, and behavior following storage was evaluated. Bulk resistance for the novel graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (GO-CNT) based ISE was observed to be 0.09 +/- 0.03 M omega, which is two orders of magnitude lower than reported for either component in isolation. The results for previously described solid contact materials are in general agreement with the literature, and the tradeoffs between solid contact layer material choices are discussed. Performance of GO-CNT solid contact ion selective electrodes were then evaluated in a 3D-printed fluidic array to determine their suitability for future in situ instruments.	[Jaramillo, E.

On planetary bodies with atmospheres, the conductivity of the surface must account for the contributions of both the solid component of the surface as well as that of atmospheric gas found in the interstitial pore spaces. Today, variations in thermal inertia and thermal conductivity on Mars affect the size and timing of areas for which surface temperatures exceed the melting point temperature of water, which is a necessary-but-not-sufficient prerequisite for surface liquid water. Models of past Mars climate, when the atmosphere may have been significantly thicker than at present, have largely neglected the potential role of interstitial atmospheric gas as a thermally conducting element of the 'surface,' though we show here that such underestimation of surface conductivity and thermal inertia has no appreciable effect on models of past Mars climate. In more recent Mars history, changes in obliquity have a similar effect of inflating or collapsing the Mars atmosphere, though to a lesser extent. Orbital changes will also modify surface thermal properties, leading to variations in surface conductivity (and thermal inertia) on 10(5)-10(7) year cycles. We show that these variations, in fact, should not be neglected. We propose an obliquity-driven cycle of surface evolution that drives variability in surface thermal inertia, and suggest that the potential for liquid water at the surface should increase with time following large, positive excursions in Mars' obliquity.

Materials that lend themselves to AM at the nanoscale, especially for optical applications, are limited. State-of-the-art AM processes for high-refractive-index materials typically suffer from high porosity and poor repeatability and require complex experimental procedures. We developed an AM process to fabricate complex 3D architectures out of fully dense titanium dioxide (TiO2) with a refractive index of 2.3 and nanosized critical dimensions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis proves this material to be rutile phase of nanocrystalline TiO2, with an average grain size of 110 nm and <1% porosity. Proof-of-concept woodpile architectures with 300-600 nm beam dimensions exhibit a full photonic band gap centered at 1.8-2.9 mu m, as revealed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and supported by plane wave expansion simulations. The developed AM process enables advances in 3D MEMS, micro-optics, and prototyping of 3D dielectric PhCs.

Resolving Photon Numbers Using a Superconducting Nanowire with Impedance-Matching Taper	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Superconducting nanowire; single-photon detector; photon-number resolution; SNSPD; impedance taper; Hong-Ou-Mandel interference	SINGLE-PHOTON; DETECTOR; TIME; GENERATION	Time- and number-resolved photon detection is crucial for quantum information processing. Existing photonnumber-resolving (PNR) detectors usually suffer from limited timing and dark-count performance or require complex fabrication and operation. Here, we demonstrate a PNR detector at telecommunication wavelengths based on a single superconducting nanowire with an integrated impedance-matching taper. The taper provides a k Omega load impedance to the nanowire, making the detector's output amplitude sensitive to the number of photon-induced hotspots. The prototyping device was able to resolve up to four absorbed photons with 16.1 ps timing jitter and <2 c.p.s. device dark count rate. Its exceptional distinction between single- and two-photon responses is ideal for high-fidelity coincidence counting and allowed us to directly observe bunching of photon pairs from a single output port of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer. This detector architecture may provide a practical solution to applications that require high timing resolution and few-photon discrimination.

The SIF signal is very small and notoriously difficult to measure, requiring sub-nanometre spectral-resolution measurements, which to date are only available from atmospheric spectrometers sampling at low spatial resolution. For example, the widely used SIF dataset derived from the GOME-2 mission is typically provided in 0.5 degrees composites. This paper presents a new SIF dataset based on GOME-2 satellite observations with an enhanced spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees and an 8 d time step covering the period 2007-2018. It leverages on a proven methodology that relies on using a light-use efficiency (LUE) modelling approach to establish a semi-empirical relationship between SIF and various explanatory variables derived from remote sensing at higher spatial resolution. An optimal set of explanatory variables is selected based on an independent validation with OCO-2 SIF observations, which are only sparsely available but have a high accuracy and spatial resolution. After bias correction, the resulting downscaled SIF data show high spatio-temporal agreement with the first SIF retrievals from the new TROPOMI mission, opening the path towards establishing a surrogate archive for this promising new dataset. We foresee this new SIF dataset becoming a valuable asset for Earth system science in general and for monitoring vegetation productivity in particular.

(DOI:) is reduced in the number of species by a O(102) factor using the local self-similarity tabulation (LS2T) method. Reduced-species mechanisms of both 20 (R20) and 15 (R15) species are created in the high-pressure combustion regime typical of diesel engines. To evaluate the performance of R20 and R15 against the elementary kinetics, simulations are performed for cyclohexane/air mixtures at initial temperatures of 1150, 900, 750, and 680 K and constant pressures of 20 and 40 bar for a variety of equivalence ratios phi (phi=0.5, 1.0, and 2 for 1150 and 900 K; phi=1 for 750 K; phi=0.5 for 680 K). Very good agreement between R20 and R15 with the elementary kinetics mechanism is demonstrated at 1150 and 900 K for which the self-similarity is very well obeyed; however, only fair agreement is obtained at 750 and 680 K, a fact which is traced to the less faithful adherence to the self-similarity due to the one order of magnitude increase in ignition time over the range 750-680 K. These results are found to be quasi-independent of the tabulation grid. Future work is proposed to improve the reduction in the cold-ignition, high-pressure regime.

The relationship between aerosol concentration and atmospheric potential gradient in urban environments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerosol; Atmospheric electricity; Urban environment; Atmospheric potential gradient; Air ion; Pollution	ION MOBILITY SPECTRA; ELECTRIC-FIELD; ATTACHMENT COEFFICIENTS; CHARGE-DISTRIBUTION; PARTICLES; DOWNWIND; UPWIND; NUMBER	Urban aerosol is a growing concern for people living within cities; aerosol have been implicated in many ill health conditions, including that of the lung and of the heart. Atmospheric potential gradient is a consequence of charge carried to the ionosphere through thunderstorms, and its value depends on highly electrically mobile ion concentrations, hence local conductivity of the air. Ions attach to aerosol in the atmosphere, reducing their mobility and therefore increasing the potential gradient, and so potential gradient measurements have been suggested as a proxy for aerosol measurements. Particle number count, size distribution and potential gradient were measured for two campaigns in Manchester, U.K., and one campaign in Bristol, U.K. Using a factor based on size distribution to account for preferential attachment at larger sizes provided the best relationship with potential gradient, but particle count alone showed a weaker, but similar relationship. The increase in particle count caused by annual bonfire and fireworks celebrations (November) was evidenced in both potential gradient and particle numbers. Daily regression or correlation did not show a consistent relationship. In the larger Bristol data set, increasing humidity led to a reduction of potential gradient, while increasing particle number led to an increase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is a question that billions of people are wondering early 2020 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This virus can produce a severe pneumonia that has killed over 230,000 people so far, was detected for the first time late 2019 in Wuhan (China), and has spread all over the world due, in part, to the difficulty of detecting and isolating asymptomatic or mild-symptomatic cases. In this paper, we explore how long suppression strategies (i.e., home confinement and social distancing) must be put into practice in highly populated cities to reduce the chances that a quick rebound of COVID-19 infections occur again over the next months. This is explored, using New York City (USA), San Francisco (USA), and Madrid (Spain) as case studies, through a simple but realistic Monte Carlo stochastic model that takes into account that part of the undetected infected individuals remain in circulation propagating the virus. Our simulations reflect that, if suppression strategies are not properly applied, they can be counterproductive because there are high chances that the confinement time has to be lengthened without reducing the total number of infections. We also estimate that, in the most conservative scenario and under the model assumptions, home confinement is effective if applied at least similar to 110 days in New York City, similar to 80 days in San Francisco, and similar to 70 days in Madrid, i.e., until mid-July 2020, early June 2020, and late May 2020, respectively.

The extended conjugation between the vinyl substituent and carbonyl oxide groups of these Criegee intermediates facilitates rapid electrocyclic ring closures that form five-membered cyclic peroxides, known as dioxoles. This study reports the first experimental evidence of this novel decay pathway, which is predicted to be the dominant atmospheric sink for specific conformational forms of MVK-oxide (anti) and MACR-oxide (syn) with the vinyl substituent adjacent to the terminal O atom. The resulting dioxoles are predicted to undergo rapid unimolecular decay to oxygenated hydrocarbon radical products, including acetyl, vinoxy, formyl, and 2-methylvinoxy radicals. In the presence of O-2, these radicals rapidly react to form peroxy radicals (ROO), which quickly decay via carbon-centered radical intermediates (QOOH) to stable carbonyl products that were identified in this work. The carbonyl products were detected under thermal conditions (298 K, 10 Torr He) using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry (MPIMS). The main products (and associated relative abundances) originating from unimolecular decay of anti-MVK-oxide and subsequent reaction with O-2 are formaldehyde (88 +/- 5%), ketene (9 +/- 1%), and glyoxal (3 +/- 1%). Those identified from the unimolecular decay of syn-MACR-oxide and subsequent reaction with O-2 are acetaldehyde (37 +/- 7%), vinyl alcohol (9 +/- 1%), methylketene (2 +/- 1%), and acrolein (52 +/- 5%). In addition to the stable carbonyl products, the secondary peroxy chemistry also generates OH or HO2 radical coproducts.

Assimilation of wide-swath altimetry water elevation anomalies to correct large-scale river routing model parameters	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; RADAR ALTIMETRY; AMAZON BASIN; UNCERTAINTIES; SCHEME	Land surface models combined with river routing models are widely used to study the continental part of the water cycle. They give global estimates of water flows and storages, but they are not without non-negligible uncertainties, among which inexact input parameters play a significant part. The incoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, with a launch scheduled for 2021 and with a required lifetime of at least 3 years, will be dedicated to the measuring of water surface elevations, widths and surface slopes of rivers wider than 100 m, at a global scale. SWOT will provide a significant number of new observations for river hydrology and maybe combined, through data assimilation, with global-scale models in order to correct their input parameters and reduce their associated uncertainty. Comparing simulated water depths with measured water surface elevations remains however a challenge and can introduce within the system large bias. A promising alternative for assimilating water surface elevations consists of assimilating water surface elevation anomalies which do not depend on a reference surface. The objective of this study is to present a data assimilation platform based on the asynchronous ensemble Kalman filter (AEnKF) that can assimilate synthetic SWOT observations of water depths and water elevation anomalies to correct the input parameters of a large-scale hydrologic model over a 21 d time window. The study is applied to the ISBA-CTRIP model over the Amazon basin and focuses on correcting the spatial distribution of the river Manning coefficients. The data assimilation algorithm, tested through a set of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), is able to retrieve the true value of the Manning coefficients within one assimilation cycle much of the time (basin-averaged Manning coefficient root mean square error, RMSEn, is reduced from 33 % to [1 %-10 %] after one assimilation cycle) and shows promising perspectives with assimilating water anomalies (basin-averaged Manning coefficient RMSEn is reduced from 33 % to [1 %-2 %] when assimilating water surface elevation anomalies over 1 year), which allows us to overcome the issue of unknown bathymetry.

Atmospheric processing of alkenes, including isoprene, via ozonolysis leads to the formation of zwitterionic reactive intermediates, known as Criegee intermediates (CIs). Direct studies have revealed that reactions involving simple CIs can significantly impact the tropospheric oxidizing capacity, enhance particulate formation, and degrade local air quality. Methyl vinyl ketone oxide (MVK-oxide) is a four-carbon, asymmetric, resonance-stabilized CI, produced with 21 to 23% yield from isoprene ozonolysis, yet its reactivity has not been directly studied. We present direct kinetic measurements of MVK-oxide reactions with key atmospheric species using absorption spectroscopy. Direct UV-Vis absorption spectra from two independent flow cell experiments overlap with the molecular beam UV-Vis-depletion spectra reported recently [M. F. Vansco, B. Marchetti, M. I. Lester, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 44309 (2018)] but suggest different conformer distributions under jet-cooled and thermal conditions. Comparison of the experimental lifet-ime herein with theory indicates only the syn-conformers are observed; anti-conformers are calculated to be removed much more rapidly via unimolecular decay. We observe experimentally and predict theoretically fast reaction of syn-MVK-oxide with SO2 and formic acid, similar to smaller alkyl-substituted CIs, and by contrast, slow removal in the presence of water. We determine products through complementary multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry, observing SO3 and identifying organic hydroperoxide formation from reaction with SO2 and formic acid, respectively. The tropospheric implications of these reactions are evaluated using a global chemistry and transport model.	[Caravan, Rebecca L.; Winiberg, Frank A.

Approaches that integrate airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with mapped extents of forests may improve estimation of mangrove heights by providing considerably more measurements of mangrove tree heights than can be achieved using field-based measurements alone. In this study, we present a validated method for quantifying mangrove AGB that was demonstrated for a mangrove forest at Guar.as Island, Brazil. The application of LiDAR to estimate mangrove height was confirmed by correlating 89 tree heights measured in the field with LiDAR-derived mangrove heights, resulting in highly robust relationships for Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle (R-2 = 0.90-0.97, RMSE of 1.24-0.67 m and RMSE% of 11.26%-25.97%). These relationships were used to calibrate a LiDAR-derived canopy height model (CHM) and develop robust relationships between the calibrated-CHM and field-based estimates of AGB (R-2 = 0.85-0.92, RMSE of 3.1 kg-42.53 kg, RMSE% of 20.66%-43.81%). This relationship was then applied to the CHM whilst accounting for tree density to estimate mangrove AGB. Total mangrove AGB per hectare was estimated to be 246.90 t ha(-1), corresponding closely with previous mangrove AGB measurements within the region. This study found that mangrove height and AGB are statistically related and these relationships can be applied to allometric equations for specific species to improve mangrove AGB estimates. This study demonstrates the capacity for LiDAR-derived tree heights to replace traditional approaches to estimating AGB and improving estimates of mangrove blue carbon storage. Application of LiDAR to determine tree heights will be particularly useful where mangrove is extensive and/or remote.

Afterslip on the Mojopampa fault following a 2013 M-W 5.9 earthquake is anomalously long lived, continuing for at least 6 years. The best fit fault plane for the afterslip is right-lateral motion on an EW striking fault at 1 km depth. We also model surface deformation from two 2017 earthquakes (M-W 4.4 and M-W 5.2) on unnamed faults, for which the best fit models are NW striking normal faults at 1-2 km depth. Our best fit model for a magmatic inflation source (13 km depth, volume change of 0.04 to 0.05 km(3) yr(-1)) induces positive Coulomb static stress changes on these modeled fault planes. Comparing these deformation results with evidence from satellite thermal and degassing data, field observations, and seismic records, we interpret strong pre-eruptive seismicity at Sabancaya as a consequence of magmatic intrusions destabilizing tectonic faults critically stressed by regionally high fluid pressures. High fluid pressure likely also promotes fault creep driven by static stress transfer from the inflation source. We speculate that combining high pore fluid pressures with sufficiently large, offset magmatic inflation can promote strong earthquakes during volcanic unrest.

The reconstruction of the conical shape of massive alluvial fans inferred to be from the Eemian (115 +/- 7 ka) from CRN dating shows consistent left-lateral offsets of 300 +/- 20 m, yielding a slip rate of 2.6 +/- 0.3 mm/year. Successive episodes of incision have left cut terraces inset in wide canyons, 10-25 m below the fans' surface. The incision was followed by the deposition of a broad terrace of early Holocene age, which is reincised by modern stream channels. Near the village of Shanxili, a 200 m wide valley is partially dammed by a shutter ridge displaced by the fault. A fill terrace deposited upstream from the ridge has an OSL age of 8.8 +/- 0.6 ka. The 23 +/- 2 m offset of the riser incising the terrace indicates a minimum postdepositional movement on the fault, yielding a Holocene rate of 2.6 +/- 0.5 mm/year, consistent with the 115-ka average slip rate. Scarp degradation analysis using mass diffusion reveals a nonlinear relationship between fault displacement and degradation coefficient along the progressively exposed fault scarp, a pattern suggesting either seismic clustering or variable diffusion rate since the Eemian. Together with the Gozha Co-Longmu Co fault to the south, the Karakax section of the Altyn Tagh Fault contributes to the eastward movement of the western corner of Tibet.

The variances are computed across frequencies ranging from supertidal, dominated by the internal gravity wave continuum, to subtidal, dominated by currents and mesoscale eddies. The most important qualitative difference between HYCOM and MITgcm, and between simulations of different resolutions, is in the supertidal band, where the 1/48 degrees MITgcm lies closest to observations. Across all frequency bands examined, the HYCOM simulations display higher spatial correlation with the MHO than do the MITgcm simulations. The supertidal, semidiurnal, and diurnal velocities in the HYCOM simulations also compare more closely with observations than do the MITgcm simulations in a number of specific continental margin/marginal sea regions. To complement the model-MHO comparisons, this paper also compares the surface ocean geostrophic eddy KE in HYCOM, MITgcm, and a gridded satellite altimeter product. Consistent with the model-MHO comparisons, the HYCOM simulations have a higher spatial correlation with the altimeter product than the MITgcm simulations do. On the other hand, the surface ocean geostrophic eddy KE is too large, relative to the altimeter product, in the HYCOM simulations. Key Points Kinetic energy and temperature variance in global HYCOM and MITgcm simulations are compared with moored observations Model resolution has large impact on the supertidal internal gravity wave continuum band Spatial correlations with observations are higher in HYCOM than in MITgcm	[Luecke, Conrad A.; Arbic, Brian K.; Ansong, Joseph K.; Timko, Patrick G.] Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Luecke, Conrad A.; Alford, Matthew H.; Voet, Gunnar] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Richman, James G.; Wallcraft, Alan J.; Zamudio, Luis] Florida State Univ, Ctr Ocean Atmospher Ptedict Studies, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Shriver, Jay F.] Naval Res Lab, Oceanog Div, Stennis Space Ctr, MS USA; [Ansong, Joseph K.] Univ Ghana, Dept Math, Accra, Ghana; [Bassette, Steven L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Phys, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Buijsman, Maarten C.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Marine Sci, Stennis Space Ctr, MS USA; [Menemenlis, Dimitris] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Earth Sci Div, Pasadena, CA USA; [Scott, Robert B.] Univ Brest, UMR CNRS 6205, Lab Math Bretagne Atlantique, Brest, France	Luecke, CA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Luecke, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.	cluecke@umich.edu		Arbic, Brian K/0000-0002-7969-2294; Menemenlis, Dimitris/0000-0001-9940-8409; Ansong, Joseph Kojo/0000-0002-2214-377X; shriver, jay/0000-0001-7154-4257	Margaret and Herman Sokol Faculty Awards; Office of Naval Research (ONR)Office of Naval Research [N00014-11-1-0487, N00014-15-1-2288, N00014-17-1-2958, N00014-18-1-2544]; National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [OCE-0968783]; NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU); ONROffice of Naval Research; National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX13AD95G, NNX16AH79G, NNX17AH55G]	We acknowledge the talent and hard work of all the many principal investigators and mooring technicians, as well as the captains and crews of many vessels, for deploying and recovering the many moorings that make the MHO possible.

Improved Internal Wave Spectral Continuum in a Regional Ocean Model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article						ocean; internal waves; internal wave spectra; ocean models; high-resolution modeling; regional modeling	SEA-SURFACE HEIGHT; SPACE-TIME SCALES; CONSISTENCY RELATIONS; KINETIC-ENERGY; GRAVITY; SIMULATION; RESOLUTION; TIDES	Recent work demonstrates that high-resolution global models forced simultaneously by atmospheric fields and the astronomical tidal potential contain a partial internal (gravity) wave (IW) spectral continuum. Regional simulations of the MITgcm forced at the horizontal boundaries by a global run that carries a partial IW continuum spectrum are performed at the same grid spacing as the global run and at finer grid spacings in an attempt to fill out more of the IW spectral continuum. Decreasing only the horizontal grid spacing from 2 to 0.25km greatly improves the frequency spectra and slightly improves the vertical wavenumber spectra of the horizontal velocity. Decreasing only the vertical grid spacing by a factor of 3 does not yield any significant improvements. Decreasing both horizontal and vertical grid spacings yields the greatest degree of improvement, filling the frequency spectrum out to 72cpd. Our results suggest that improved IW spectra in regional models are possible if they are run at finer grid spacings and are forced at their lateral boundaries by remotely generated IWs. Additionally, consistency relations demonstrate that improvements in the spectra are indeed due to the existence of IWs at higher frequencies and vertical wavenumbers when remote IW forcing is included and model grid spacings decrease. By being able to simulate an IW spectral continuum to 0.25km scales, these simulations demonstrate that one may be able to track the energy pathways of IWs from generation to dissipation and improve the understanding of processes such as IW-driven mixing. Plain Language Summary Models of internal waves (IWs) may help us to better understand the spatial geography of mixing in the ocean and are playing an increasingly important role in the planning of satellite missions. Following recent work showing that high-resolution global models contain a partial IW spectrum, this paper describes further improvements in the spectrum seen in a high-resolution regional model forced at the boundaries by a previously performed global IW simulation. Decreasing only the horizontal grid spacing greatly improves the frequency spectra and slightly improves the vertical wavenumber spectra of velocity. Increasing only the number of vertical levels does not yield any significant improvements. Decreasing both horizontal and vertical grid spacings yields the greatest improvement in both spectra. Our results suggest that regional models can exhibit improved IW spectra over global models if two conditions are met-they must have higher horizontal and vertical resolutions, and they must have remotely generated IWs at their boundaries. Application of the so-called consistency relations demonstrates that the model is indeed carrying a field of high-frequency IWs. Being able to simulate a fuller IW spectrum demonstrates that one may be able to use these models to improve the understanding of IW-driven processes and energy pathways. Key Points Internal gravity wave spectra in regional models are more realistic as model grid spacing decreases The vertical wavenumber spectra improve less dramatically than the frequency spectra Internal gravity wave consistency relations are applied to modeled spectra	[Nelson, A.

Winter Arctic Sea Ice Thickness From ICESat-2 Freeboards	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							SNOW DEPTH; BEAUFORT GYRE; FRESH-WATER; CRYOSAT-2; OCEAN; ICEBRIDGE; ASSIMILATION; CIRCULATION; RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHM	National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The sole instrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is now providing routine, very high-resolution, surface elevation data across the globe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrate our new processing chain for converting the along-track ICESat-2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness, focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, we primarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snow on Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution (similar to 100 km) snow data are redistributed onto the high-resolution (approximately 30-100 m) ATL10 freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea ice thickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through our first winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertainty estimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. We generate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with various monthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 satellite mission, with ICESat-2 showing consistently lower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thickness estimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thickness estimates using the same input assumptions, which show an similar to 0.37 m or similar to 20% thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11-year time period. Plain Language Summary NASA's ICESat-2 mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The sole instrument onboard is a highly precise laser, which is now providing routine, very high-resolution, surface height measurements across the globe, including over the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we show new estimates of Arctic sea ice thickness from the first winter season of data collected by ICESat-2. Sea ice thickness is calculated by combining the measured ICESat-2 freeboards-the extension of sea ice above sea level-with a new snow on sea ice model. Our derived thicknesses are consistently lower than the thicknesses calculated from ESA's CryoSat-2 data and the original ICESat mission, which ended in 2008. More work is needed to verify these new thickness estimates.

The degree to which archived satellite data effectively capture the overall population of river flow frequency is unknown. Here, we use the entire archives of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 to determine when a cloud-free image is available over the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river gauges located on Landsat-observable rivers. We compare the flow frequency distribution derived from the daily gauge record to the flow frequency distribution derived from ideally sampling gauged discharge based on the timing of cloud-free Landsat overpasses. Examining the patterns of flow frequency across multiple gauges, we find that there is not a statistically significant difference between the flow frequency distribution associated with observations contained within the Landsat archive and the flow frequency distribution derived from the daily gauge data (alpha = 0.05), except for hydrological extremes like maximum and minimum flow. At individual gauges, we find that Landsat observations span a wide range of hydrological conditions (97% of total flow variability observed in 90% of the study gauges) but the degree to which the Landsat sample can represent flow frequency distribution varies from location to location and depends on sample size. The results of this study indicate that the Landsat archive is, on average, representative of the temporal frequencies of hydrological conditions present along Earth's large rivers with broad utility for hydrological, ecologic and biogeochemical evaluations of river systems.

Evaluation of the Sensitivity of SMOS L-VOD to Forest Above-Ground Biomass at Global Scale	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						L-VOD; AGB (Above Ground Biomass); SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity)	SOIL-MOISTURE RETRIEVAL; VEGETATION OPTICAL DEPTH; L-BAND; DATA SETS; CLIMATE; MAP; BACKSCATTER; MISSION; MODEL	The present study evaluates the L band Vegetation Optical Depth (L-VOD) derived from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite to monitor Above Ground Biomass (AGB) at a global scale. Although SMOS L-VOD has been shown to be a good proxy for AGB in Africa and Tropics, little is known about this relationship at large scale. In this study, we further examine this relationship at a global scale using the latest AGB maps from Saatchi et al. and GlobBiomass computed using data acquired during the SMOS period. We show that at a global scale the L-VOD from SMOS is well-correlated with the AGB estimates from Saatchi et al. and GlobBiomass with the Pearson's correlation coefficients (R) of 0.91 and 0.94 respectively. Although AGB estimates in Africa and the Tropics are well-captured by SMOS L-VOD (R > 0.9), the relationship is less straightforward for the dense forests over the northern latitudes (R = 0.32 and 0.69 with Saatchi et al. and GlobBiomass respectively). This paper gives strong evidence in support of the sensitivity of SMOS L-VOD to AGB estimates at a globale scale, providing an interesting alternative and complement to exisiting sensors for monitoring biomass evolution. These findings can further facilitate research on biomass now that SMOS is providing more than 10 years of data.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Earth Observation Satellites (EOS) can be used to determine the extent of flooding over large geographical areas. Unlike optical sensors, SAR instruments are suitable for cloudy weather conditions, making them suitable for flood detection and mapping during extreme weather events. In this study, we explore the application of the Normalized Difference Sigma-Naught Index (NDSI) and Shannon's entropy of NDSI (SNDSI) of Sentinel-1 data for open water flooding detection, based on automatic thresholding and Bayesian probability. The proposed methodology was tested using the floods in Sofala province, Mozambique, caused by cyclone Idai on March 14-19 of 2019. Results show that thresholding of the NDSI Vertical Transmit-Horizontal Receive (VH) can produce results with Overall Accuracy above 90%, and Kappa higher than 0.6. Considerable performance improvements were obtained by our thresholding method over the entropy of NDSI, yielding results with Kappa of 0.70-0.77. Additionally, it was found that Weibull distribution can properly describe the properties of flooded pixels within the histogram of SNDSI, which allows us to generate a flood probability raster using a Bayesian approach. The final per-pixel flooding probability is useful to indicate certainty in the classification results. The SNDSI Bayesian model produced an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 0.93-0.97, with cross-polarized data yielding the most accurate results.

An Iterative ICA-Based Reconstruction Method to Produce Consistent Time-Variable Total Water Storage Fields Using GRACE and Swarm Satellite Data	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						GRACE; GRACE-FO; Swarm; independent component analysis (ICA); data reconstruction; trends of mass changes; world river basins; iterative ICA reconstruction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EARTHS GRAVITY-FIELD; MIDDLE-EAST; KINEMATIC ORBITS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASINS; MASS CHANGE; VARIABILITY; AFRICA; PRECIPITATION	Observing global terrestrial water storage changes (TWSCs) from (inter-)seasonal to (multi-)decade time-scales is very important to understand the Earth as a system under natural and anthropogenic climate change. The primary goal of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (2002-2017) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO, 2018-onward) is to provide time-variable gravity fields, which can be converted to TWSCs with <mml:semantics>similar to 300</mml:semantics> km spatial resolution; however, the one year data gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO represents a critical discontinuity, which cannot be replaced by alternative data or model with the same quality. To fill this gap, we applied time-variable gravity fields (2013-onward) from the Swarm Earth explorer mission with low spatial resolution of <mml:semantics>similar to 1500</mml:semantics> km. A novel iterative reconstruction approach was formulated based on the independent component analysis (ICA) that combines the GRACE and Swarm fields. The reconstructed TWSC fields of 2003-2018 were compared with a commonly applied reconstruction technique and GRACE-FO TWSC fields, whose results indicate a considerable noise reduction and long-term consistency improvement of the iterative ICA reconstruction technique. They were applied to evaluate trends and seasonal mass changes (of 2003-2018) within the world's 33 largest river basins.

This is driven by the needs of the energy, water management, and agriculture sectors, to name a few. There is an increasing realization that, unlike weather forecasts, prediction skill on longer time scales can leverage specific climate phenomena or conditions for a predictable signal above the weather noise. Currently, it is understood that these conditions are intermittent in time and have spatially heterogeneous impacts on skill, hence providing strategic windows of opportunity for skillful forecasts. Research points to such windows of opportunity, including El Nino or La Nina events, active periods of the Madden-Julian oscillation, disruptions of the stratospheric polar vortex, when certain large-scale atmospheric regimes are in place, or when persistent anomalies occur in the ocean or land surface. Gains could be obtained by increasingly developing prediction tools and metrics that strategically target these specific windows of opportunity. Across the globe, reevaluating forecasts in this manner could find value in forecasts previously discarded as not skillful. Users' expectations for prediction skill could be more adequately met, as they are better aware of when and where to expect skill and if the prediction is actionable. Given that there is still untapped potential, in terms of process understanding and prediction methodologies, it is safe to expect that in the future forecast opportunities will expand. Process research and the development of innovative methodologies will aid such progress.

Combined with dedicated follow-up systems, which allow for high-cadence photometry of these sources, systematic confirmation and characterization of these sources are now possible. Here, we report the discovery of ZTF J190125.42+530929.5, a 40.6-min orbital period, eclipsing double white dwarf binary. Both photometric modelling and spectroscopic modelling confirm its nature, yielding an estimated inclination of i = 86.2(-0.2)(+0.6) deg and primary and secondary effective temperatures of T-eff = 28 000(-500)(+500) and 17 600(-400)(+400) K, respectively. This system adds to a growing list of sources for future gravitational-wave detectors and contributes to the demographic analysis of double degenerates.

We investigated the role of CO2 snowfall in altering the albedo and emissivity, leading to the observed asymmetry in the net CO2 accumulation at the two poles. Uncontaminated snowfall increases albedo, and lowers emissivity, due to scattering by optically thick clouds and granular surface deposits. Data from the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) show that fall and winter snowfall is correlated with higher springtime albedo at both poles. For the seasonal CO2 deposits in each polar region >60 degrees latitude, we find mean albedo values of 0.39 in the north and 0.51 in the south, and winter 32-mu m emissivity values of 0.84 in the north and 0.87 in the south. Using a radiative transfer model and the MCS data, we find that the north polar deposits have similar to 10x higher dust content than those in the south, explaining the similar to 31% lower albedo of the north seasonal cap during spring. Our model shows that greater amounts of snowfall can explain the similar to 4% lower emissivity of the north polar seasonal cap. These findings demonstrate that winter snowfall and dust transport affect the composition of Mars' seasonal ice caps and polar energy balance. Snowfall and dust loading are therefore important in modeling the CO2 cycle on Mars, as well as the planet's long-term climate variations.	[Gary-Bicas, C. E.; Havne, P.

We constrain the dip of lacustrine strata of the Blunts Point, Pettegrove Point, and Jura members of the Murray formation using a combination of regional stratigraphic correlations and bed attitude measurements from stereo Mastcam images taken by the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover. In situ bed attitude measurements using a principal component analysis-based regression method reveal a wide range of dips and dip azimuths owing to a combination of high stereo errors, postdepositional deformation of strata (e.g., fracturing, rotation, and impact cratering), and different primary depositional dips. These constrain regional dips to be within several degrees of horizontal on average. Stratigraphic correlations between targets observed in the Glen Torridon trough and at the Pettegrove Point-Jura member contact of Vera Rubin ridge (VRR) constrain dips to be between 3 degrees SE and 2 degrees NW, consistent with nearly flat strata deposited horizontally on an equipotential surface. The Jura member is determined to be stratigraphically equivalent to the northern portion of the Glen Torridon trough. Rover-based dip magnitudes are generally significantly shallower than the orientation of VRR member contacts measured from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment-based traces, suggesting the sedimentary strata and VRR member contacts may be discordant. Plain Language Summary The orientation of sedimentary strata is one of the most fundamental measurements of structural geology because it records information about the processes of deposition and subsequent deformation of those strata. For the last 7 years, the Curiosity rover has traversed predominantly fluviolacustrine (river- and lake-deposited) strata. Recently, the rover traversed the Vera Rubin ridge (VRR), a topographic rise within a larger collection of strata with rock exposures whose orientation can be measured using overlapping (stereo) images taken by cameras aboard the rover. By measuring the orientation of beds in stereo rover images and comparing the elevation of similar rock lithologies found along the traverse, we constrain the strata that comprise the VRR to be horizontal or only shallowly dipping. This result is consistent with the sediment that formed the VRR being deposited on a nearly horizontal surface, suggesting that at least the strata that make up the lower portion of Mount Sharp, the large sedimentary mound in Gale crater that dips more steeply outward, may not have directly contributed to its primary formation. The near-flat orientation also indicates that some portion of the VRR occurs at the same elevation as the region south of the ridge called Glen Torridon.

Calibration of the Falcon Solid-state Energetic Electron Detector (SEED)	SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article								The Falcon Solid-state Energetic Electron Detector (FalconSEED) is an energetic charged particle sensor that has been developed and tested at the United States Air Force Academy in an effort to monitor electron flux across the energy range of 14 to 145 keV in geosynchronous orbit. This sensor has been developed to complement ongoing efforts by the Air Force Research Laboratory to advance a comprehensive space environment sensor suite, Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor (CEASE3), for anomaly resolution. In addition, FalconSEED is intended to demonstrate the ability to operate a radiation sensor based on predominantly commercial off the shelf components in the geosynchronous environment. This paper describes the design, development, and calibration of FalconSEED. The electron energy spectrum of interest for the FalconSEED sensor is 14 to 145 keV, and is intended to supplement data acquired from the CEASE3 instrument for anomaly resolution. The calibrations at the Space Atmospheric Research Center at the United States Air Force Academy and Kirtland Air Force Base were used to first establish the conversion between histogram bin number and deposited energy in the sensor, and second have been used to determine the geometric factor as a function of energy. The FalconSEED will be integrated as a science payload on the Space Test Program Satellite-6 which also includes the first flight of the CEASE3 instrument and is scheduled to launch in 2021.

Extensive work has focused on the formation of alteration minerals at low temperatures, with limited work investigating metamorphic or high-temperature alteration. We have investigated such a site as an analog for Mars: a mafic dike on the Colorado Plateau that was hydrothermally altered from contact with groundwater as it was emplaced in the porous and permeable Jurassic Entrada sandstone. Our results show evidence for fluid mobility removing Si and K but adding S, Fe, Ca, and possibly Mg to the system as alteration progresses. Mineralogically, all samples contain calcite, hematite, and kaolinite; with most samples containing minor anatase, barite, halite, and dolomite. The number of alteration minerals increase with alteration. The hydrothermal system that formed during interaction of the magma (heat source) and groundwater would have been a habitable environment once the system cooled below similar to 120 degrees C. The mineral assemblage is similar to alteration minerals seen within the Martian crust from orbit, including those at Gusev and Jezero Craters. Therefore, based on our findings, and extrapolating them to the Martian crust, these sites may represent habitable environments which would call for further exploration and sample return of such hydrothermally altered igneous materials.

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 1.3 mm dust continuum and (CO)-C-12 J = 2 - 1 molecular gas emission of the disk. For the first time, we identify three dust rings in the GW Ori disk at similar to 46, 188, and 338 au, with estimated dust mass of 74, 168, and 245 Earth masses, respectively. To our knowledge, its outermost ring is the largest dust ring ever found in protoplanetary disks. We use visibility modeling of dust continuum to show that the disk has misaligned parts, and the innermost dust ring is eccentric. The disk misalignment is also suggested by the CO kinematics. We interpret these substructures as evidence of ongoing dynamical interactions between the triple stars and the circumtriple disk.

Bruce			Scientific Observations With the InSight Solar Arrays: Dust, Clouds, and Eclipses on Mars	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						sunlight; dust; Mars; clouds; eclipses	AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; SCIENCE; REMS; MSL	Records of solar array currents recorded by the InSight lander during its first 200 sols on Mars are presented. In addition to the geometric variation in illumination on seasonal and diurnal timescales, the data are influenced by dust suspended in the atmosphere and deposited on the solar panels. Although no dust devils have been detected by InSight's cameras, brief excursions in solar array currents suggest that at least some of the vortices detected by transient pressure drops are accompanied by dust. A step increase in array output (i.e., a "cleaning event") was observed to be directly associated with the passage of a strong vortex. Some quasiperiodic variations in solar array current are suggestive of dust variations in the planetary boundary layer. Nonzero array outputs before sunrise and after sunset are indicative of scattering in the atmosphere: A notable increase in evening twilight currents is observed associated with noctilucent clouds, likely of water or carbon dioxide ice. Finally, although the observations are intermittent (typically a few hours per sol) and at a modest sample rate (one to two samples per minute), three single-sample light dips are seen associated with Phobos eclipses. These results demonstrate that engineering data from solar arrays provide valuable scientific situational awareness of the Martian environment.

Calibration of the HP3 Radiometer on InSight	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						thermal infrared radiometer; calibration; Mars surface temperature	GROUND TEMPERATURE; HEAT-FLOW; MARS; SURFACE; LANDER; DISTURBANCES; SENSOR; REMS	The Heatflow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) radiometer is currently operating on Mars, observing two spots approximately 1 and 3 m north-north-west of the InSight lander. The instrument has primary sensors that are sensitive in the range of 8 to 14 mu m and two more sensors with more narrow spectral ranges per field of view. The radiometer underwent radiometric and geometric calibration at DLR-Berlin; and on Mars radiometric self-calibration is performed regularly. The self-calibration confirms that one of the two primary sensors has been stable since the ground calibration, but environmental parameters that are likely associated with the thermal contact of sensor and instrument main body may have slightly changed. The other primary sensor has increased in sensitivity for an unknown reason but is still within expectation from the sensor design. The uncertainty of the two primary sensors is approximately 3 K at night, with somewhat larger errors in the late afternoon. This estimate includes the effect of sensitivity changes that would be too small to be reliably detected by the self-calibration.	[Mueller, N.

The proposed differential subharmonic mixer topology is verified by presenting a CMOS millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC), which includes the mixer and two on-chip differential IF amplifiers at the mixer's I- and Q-channels. The 3-dB IF frequency bandwidth is measured from 0.01 to 5 GHz with a peak conversion gain (CG) of -2 dB and an image rejection ratio (IRR) of more than 25 dB over the IF frequency range. The proposed mixer covers the input signal (RF) frequency from 170 to 185 GHz. The mixer has also been tested with an on-chip voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and shows -4.7-dB CG with a 3-dB IF bandwidth from 0.01 to 4.5 GHz.

The STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) 2017/2018 follow-up campaign: discovery of 10 lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; methods: observational; quasars: general	TIME-DELAY; GRAVITATIONAL LENSES; SKY; GAIA; VARIABILITY; SEXTRACTOR; CANDIDATES; COSMOGRAIL; SELECTION; REDSHIFT	We report the results of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) follow-up campaign of the late 2017/early 2018 season. We obtained spectra of 65 lensed quasar candidates with ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera 2 on the NTT and Echellette Spectrograph and Imager on Keck, confirming 10 new lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs. Eight lensed quasars are doubly imaged with source redshifts between 0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged (DESJ0345 -2545, z = 1.68), and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053 -2012, z = 3.8). Singular isothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on high-resolution imaging from SAMI on Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope or Near In fraRed Camera 2 on Keck, give total magnifications between 3.2 and 5.6, and Einstein radii between 0.49 and 1.97 arcsec. After spectroscopic follow-up, we extract multi-epoch grizY photometry of confirmed lensed quasars and contaminant quasar + star pairs from DES data using parametric multiband modelling, and compare variability in each system's components. By measuring the reduced chi(2) associated with fitting all epochs to the same magnitude, we find a simple cut on the less variable component that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent of contaminant systems. Based on our spectroscopic follow-up, this variability information improves selection of lensed quasars and quasar pairs from 34-45 per cent to 51-70 per cent, with most remaining contaminants being star-forming galaxies. Using mock lensed quasar light curves we demonstrate that selection based only on variability will over-represent the quad fraction by 10 per cent over a complete DES magnitude-limited sample, explained by the magnification bias and hence lower luminosity/more variable sources in quads.

DES Collaboration	First cosmology results using type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey: the effect of host galaxy properties on supernova luminosity	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						surveys; supernovae: general; distance scale; cosmology: observations; transients: supernovae	POPULATION SYNTHESIS; MASS; SEXTRACTOR; SOFTWARE; PEGASE	We present improved photometric measurements for the host galaxies of 206 spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae discovered by the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. For the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D (z, x(1), c, alpha, #) bias correction, we find evidence of a Hubble residual 'mass step', where SNe Ia in high-mass galaxies (>10(10)M(circle dot)) are intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low-mass counterparts by gamma = 0.040 +/- 0.019 mag. This value is larger by 0.031 mag than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. This difference is due to a combination of updated photometric measurements and improved star formation histories and is not from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a 1D (redshift-only) bias correction the inferred mass step is larger, with gamma = 0.066 +/- 0.020 mag. The 1D-5D gamma difference for DES-SN is 0.026 +/- 0.009 mag. We show that this difference is due to a strong correlation between host galaxy stellar mass and the x(1) component of the 5D distance-bias correction. Including an intrinsic correlation between the observed properties of SNe Ia, stretch and colour, and stellar mass in simulated SN Ia samples, we show that a 5D fit recovers gamma with -9 mmag bias compared to a +2 mmag bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of the discrepancy seen in the data. Improvements in modelling correlations between galaxy properties and SN is necessary to ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark energy equation of state as we enter the era of LSST.

DES Collaboration	Blinding multiprobe cosmological experiments	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; methods: numerical; methods: statistical; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	IA SUPERNOVAE; COSMIC SHEAR; CONSTRAINTS; EFFICIENT; COVARIANCES; INFERENCE; H-0	The goal of blinding is to hide an experiment's critical results - here the inferred cosmological parameters - until all decisions affecting its analysis have been finalized. This is especially important in the current era of precision cosmology, when the results of any new experiment are closely scrutinized for consistency or tension with previous results. In analyses that combine multiple observational probes, like the combination of galaxy clustering and weak lensing in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), it is challenging to blind the results while retaining the ability to check for (in)consistency between different parts of the data. We propose a simple new blinding transformation, which works by modifying the summary statistics that are input to parameter estimation, such as two-point correlation functions. The transformation shifts the measured statistics to new values that are consistent with (blindly) shifted cosmological parameters while preserving internal (in)consistency. We apply the blinding transformation to simulated data for the projected DES Year 3 galaxy clustering and weak lensing analysis, demonstrating that practical blinding is achieved without significant perturbation of internal-consistency checks, as measured here by degradation of the chi(2) between the data and best-fitting model. Our blinding method's performance is expected to improve as experiments evolve to higher precision and accuracy.	[Muir, J.; Roodman, A.; Burke, D.

DES Collaboration	Observation and confirmation of nine strong-lensing systems in Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; techniques: spectroscopic; galaxies: individual	GRAVITATIONALLY LENSED QUASARS; GALAXIES; SEXTRACTOR; DISCOVERY; H-0	We describe the observation and confirmation of nine new strong gravitational lenses discovered in Year 1 data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We created candidate lists based on (i) galaxy group and cluster samples, and (ii) photometrically selected galaxy samples. We selected 46 candidates through visual inspection and then used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at the Gemini South telescope to acquire a spectroscopic follow-up of 21 of these candidates. Through an analysis of these spectroscopic follow-up data, we confirmed nine new lensing systems and rejected two candidates, and the analysis was inconclusive on 10 candidates. For each of the confirmed systems, our report measured spectroscopic properties, estimated source image-lens separations, and estimated enclosed masses as well. The sources that we targeted have an i-band surface brightness range of i(SB) similar to 22-24 mag arcsec(-2) and a spectroscopic redshift range of z(spec) similar to 0.8-2.6. The lens galaxies have a photometric redshift range of z(lens) similar to 0.3-0.7. The lensing systems range in source image-lens separation from 2 to 9 arcsec and in enclosed mass from 10(12) to 10(13) M-circle dot.	[Nord, B.; Buckley-Geer, E.; Lin, H.; Kuropatkin, N.; Tucker, D.

We find that 5-40 per cent of the outer (50-300 kpc) stellar halo in each system consists of in-situ stars that were born in outflows from the main galaxy. Outflow stars originate from gas accelerated by superbubble winds, which can be compressed, cool, and form co-moving stars. The majority of these stars remain bound to the halo and fall back with orbital properties similar to the rest of the stellar halo at z = 0. In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal-rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo. At the solar location, up to similar to 10 per cent of our kinematically identified halo stars were born in outflows; the fraction rises to as high as similar to 40 per cent for the most metal-rich local halo stars ([Fe/H] > -0.5). Such stars can be retrograde and create features similar to the recently discovered Milky Way 'Splash' in phase space. We conclude that the Milky Way stellar halo could contain local counterparts to stars that are observed to form in molecular outflows in distant galaxies. Searches for such a population may provide a new, near-field approach to constraining feedback and outflow physics. A stellar halo contribution from outflows is a phase-reversal of the classic halo formation scenario of Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandange, who suggested that halo stars formed in rapidly infalling gas clouds. Stellar outflows may be observable in direct imaging of external galaxies and could provide a source for metal-rich, extreme-velocity stars in the Milky Way.

Local AGN survey (LASr): I. Galaxy sample, infrared colour selection, and predictions for AGN within 100 Mpc	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: Seyfert; infrared: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUBARCSECOND MIDINFRARED VIEW; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; DIAGNOSTIC DIAGRAMS; UNIFIED MODEL; RAY-EMISSION; BLACK-HOLES; EVOLUTION; MASS	To answer major questions on supermassive black hole (SMBH) and galaxy evolution, a complete census of SMBH growth, i.e. active galactic nuclei (AGN), is required. Thanks to all-sky surveys by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) missions, this task is now feasible in the nearby Universe. We present a new survey, the Local AGN Survey (LASr), with the goal of identifying AGN unbiased against obscuration and determining the intrinsic Compton-thick (CT) fraction. We construct the most complete all-sky galaxy sample within 100 Mpc (90 per cent completeness for log (M-*/M-circle dot) similar to 9.4), four times deeper than the current reference, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey Redshift Survey (2MRS), which misses similar to 20 per cent of known luminous AGN. These 49k galaxies serve as parent sample for LASr, called LASr-GPS. It contains 4.3k already known AGN, >= 82 per cent of these are estimated to have L-nuc(12 mu m) < 10(42.3) erg s(-1), i.e. are low-luminosity AGN. As a first method for identifying Seyfert-like AGN, we use WISE-based infrared colours, finding 221 galaxies at L-nuc(12 mu m) >= 10(42.3) erg s(-1) to host an AGN at 90 per cent reliability. This includes 61 new AGN candidates and implies an optical type 2 fraction of 50-71 per cent. We quantify the efficiency of this technique and estimate the total number of AGN with L-int (2-10 keV) >= 10(42) erg s(-1 )in the volume to be 362(-116)(+145) (8.6(-2.8)(+)(3.5) x 10(-5) Mpc(-3)). X-ray brightness estimates indicate the CT fraction to be 40-55 per cent to explain the Swift non-detections of the infrared selected objects. One third of the AGN within 100 Mpc remain to be identified, and we discuss the prospects for the eROSITA all-sky survey to detect them.	[Asmus, D.; Greenwell, C. L.; Gandhi, P.; Boorman, P.

We investigate the correlation between the orientation of star-forming cores (as defined by the core major axes) and ambient magnetic field directions in (i) a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation, (ii) synthetic observations generated from the simulation at different viewing angles, and (iii) observations of nearby molecular clouds. We find that the results on relative alignment between cores and background magnetic field in synthetic observations slightly disagree with those measured in fully 3D simulation data, which is partly because cores identified in projected 2D maps tend to coexist within filamentary structures, while 3D cores are generally more rounded. In addition, we examine the progression of magnetic field from pc to core scale in the simulation, which is consistent with the anisotropic core formation model that gas preferably flows along the magnetic field towards dense cores. When comparing the observed cores identified from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey and Planck polarizationinferred magnetic field orientations, we find that the relative core-field alignment has a regional dependence among different clouds. More specifically, we find that dense cores in the Taurus molecular cloud tend to align perpendicular to the background magnetic field, while those in Perseus and Ophiuchus tend to have random (Perseus) or slightly parallel (Ophiuchus) orientations with respect to the field. We argue that this feature of relative core-field orientation could be used to probe the relative significance of the magnetic field within the cloud.

Euclid: the selection of quiescent and star-forming galaxies using observed colours	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: general; galaxies: photometry	CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; EVOLUTION SURVEY COSMOS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE; MAGNITUDE DISTRIBUTION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; FORMATION RATES; LEGACY SURVEY; STELLAR MASS; RED SEQUENCE	The Euclid mission will observe well over a billion galaxies out to z similar to 6 and beyond. This will offer an unrivalled opportunity to investigate several key questions for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. The first step for many of these studies will be the selection of a sample of quiescent and star-forming galaxies, as is often done in the literature by using well-known colour techniques such as the UV/diagram. However, given the limited number of filters available for the Euclid telescope, the recovery of such rest-frame colours will be challenging. We therefore investigate the use of observed Euclid colours, on their own and together with ground-based u-band observations, for selecting quiescent and star-forming galaxies. The most efficient colour combination, among the ones tested in this work, consists of the (u - VIS) and (VIS - J) colours. We find that this combination allows users to select a sample of quiescent galaxies complete to above similar to 70 per cent and with less than 15 per cent contamination at redshifts in the range 0.75 < z < 1. For galaxies at high-z or without the u-band complementary observations, the (VIS - Y) and (J - H) colours represent a valid alternative, with > 65 per cent completeness level and contamination below 20 per cent at 1 < z < 2 for finding quiescent galaxies. In comparison, the sample of quiescent galaxies selected with the traditional UVJ technique is only similar to 20 per cent complete at z < 3, when recovering the rest-frame colours using mock Euclid observations. This shows that our new methodology is the most suitable one when only Euclid bands, along with u-band imaging, are available.	[Bisigello, L.; Kuchner, U.; Conselice, C.

Before launch, a capsule is attached to the balloon, and rises with it. Upon remote command, the capsule is released and descends via parachute, continuously transmitting its location. Software to predict the trajectory can be used to select a safe but accessible landing site. We dropped two such capsules from the SuperBIT telescope, in September 2019. The capsules took similar to 37 minutes to descend from similar to 30 km altitude. They drifted 32 km and 19 km horizontally, but landed within 300 m and 600 m of their predicted landing sites. We found them easily, and successfully recovered the data. We welcome interest from other balloon teams for whom the technology would be useful.	[Sirks, E. L.; Massey, R.

After validating our technique against several sets of numerical simulations, we perform the analysis for the cosmological parameters of the DR12 BOSS data. We assume Lambda CDM, a fixed value of the baryon/dark-matter ratio, Omega(b)/Omega(c), and of the tilt of the primordial power spectrum, n(s), and no significant input from numerical simulations. By using the one-loop power spectrum multipoles, we measure the primordial amplitude of the power spectrum, A(s), the abundance of matter, Omega(m), and the Hubble parameter, H-0, to about 13%, 3.2% and 3.2% respectively, obtaining ln(10(10)A(s)) = 2.72 +/- 0.13, Omega(m )= 0.309 +/- 0.010, H-0 = 68.5 +/- 2.2 km/(s Mpc) at 68% confidence level. If we then add a CMB prior on the sound horizon, the error bar on H-0 is reduced to 1.6%. These results are a substantial qualitative and quantitative improvement with respect to former analyses, and suggest that the EFTofLSS is a powerful instrument to extract cosmological information from Large-Scale Structure.

A new parameterization of cloud-top-triggered downdrafts is proposed and validated against large-eddy simulation (LES) for two Sc cases. The applied nonlocal mass-flux scheme is part of the stochastic multiplume eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux (EDMF) framework decomposing the turbulent transport into local and nonlocal contributions. The complementary local turbulent transport is represented with the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino (MYNN) scheme. This EDMF version has been implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) single-column model (SCM) and tested for three model versions: without mass flux, with updrafts only, and with both updrafts and downdrafts. In the LES, the downdraft and updraft contributions to the total heat and moisture transport are comparable and significant. The WRF SCM results show a good agreement between the parameterized downdraft turbulent transport and LES. While including updrafts greatly improves the modeling of Sc clouds over the simulation without mass flux, the addition of downdrafts is less significant, although it helps improve the moisture profile in the planetary boundary layer.

Recently, ground-based measurements of the meta-stable helium atom's resonant absorption at 10830 A has become a powerful probe of the base environment which is driving the outflow of exoplanet atmospheres. We report evidence for the He i 10830 A in absorption (equivalent width similar to 0.012 0.002 A) in the exosphere of a warm Neptune orbiting the M-dwarf GJ 3470, during three transits using the Habitable Zone Planet Finder near-infrared spectrograph. This marks the first reported evidence for He i 10830 A atmospheric absorption for a planet orbiting an M-dwarf. Our detected absorption is broad and its blueshifted wing extends to -36 km s(-1), the largest reported in the literature to date. We modeled the state of helium atoms in the exosphere of GJ3470b based on assumptions on the UV and X-ray flux of GJ 3470, and found our measurement of flux-weighted column density of meta-stable state helium derived from our transit observations, to be consistent with the model, within its uncertainties. The methodology developed here will be useful to study and constrain the atmospheric outflow models of other exoplanets like GJ 3470b, which are near the edge of the evaporation desert.

The method can provide accurate input data over a wide portion of the dispersion plane for both structural and rotational inversions. This method, which we call the Multiple-Peak, Tesseral-Spectrum (MPTS) method, operates directly upon of all of the modes in a multiplet (n, l) of radial order n and degree l, and employs a fitting profile that consists of the sum of numerous individual overlapping profiles whose relative amplitudes are determined by the leakage matrix appropriate to the targeted mode. Hence, 2l + 1 sets of modal parameters are obtained simultaneously for each multiplet (n, l). By fitting an appropriate polynomial to the run of the fitted frequencies versus the azimuthal order, frequency-splitting coefficients are also obtained for the same multiplet. Using power spectra obtained from the 66 day long 2010 MDI Dynamics Run, we present sample structural and rotational inversions that employed frequencies and frequency-splitting coefficients from modes in the degree range of 0-1000 and the frequency range of 965-4600 mu Hz. The structural inversion confirms evidence for a pronounced departure of the sound speed in the outer solar convection zone from the radial sound-speed profile contained in Model S of Christensen-Dalsgaard and his collaborators that we obtained previously using a different fitting method.

However, these methods are insensitive to rotationally invariant structures, such as the bands seen in Jupiter. Here, we present H-band Very Large Telescope/NaCo linear polarization measurements of the nearby Luhman 16 L/T transition binary, which suggest that Luhman 16A exhibits constant longitudinal cloud bands. The instrument was operated in pupil tracking mode, allowing us to unambiguously distinguish between a small astrophysical polarization and the similar to 2% instrumental linear polarization. We measure the degree and angle of linear polarization of Luhman 16A and B to be p(A) = 0.031% 0.004% and psi(A) = -32 degrees 4 degrees, and p(B) = 0.010% 0.004% and , respectively. Using known physical parameters of the system, we demonstrate that an oblate homogeneous atmosphere cannot account for the polarization measured in Luhman 16A, but could be responsible for that of the B component. Through a nonexhaustive search of banded cloud morphologies, we demonstrate a two-banded scenario that can achieve a degree of linear polarization of p = 0.03% and conclude that the measured polarization of the A component must be predominantly due to cloud banding. For Luhman 16B, either oblateness or cloud banding could be the dominant source of the measured polarization. The misaligned polarization angles of the two binary components tentatively suggest spin-orbit misalignment. These measurements provide new evidence for the prevalence of cloud banding in brown dwarfs while at the same time demonstrating a new method-complementary to photometric and spectroscopic variability methods-for characterizing the cloud morphologies of substellar objects without signs of variability.

Using remote sensing to detect, validate, and quantify methane emissions from California solid waste operations	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						methane; climate; imaging spectroscopy; landfills; composting; waste	CARBON-DIOXIDE; POINT SOURCES; LANDFILLS	Solid waste management represents one of the largest anthropogenic methane emission sources. However, precise quantification of landfill and composting emissions remains difficult due to variety of site-specific factors that contribute to landfill gas generation and effective capture. Remote sensing is an avenue to quantify process-level emissions from waste management facilities. The California Methane Survey flew the Next Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) over 270 landfills and 166 organic waste facilities repeatedly during 2016-2018 to quantify their contribution to the statewide methane budget. We use representative methane retrievals from this campaign to present three specific findings where remote sensing enabled better landfill and composting methane monitoring: (1) Quantification of strong point source emissions from the active face landfills that are difficult to capture by in situ monitoring or landfill models, (2) emissions that result from changes in landfill infrastructure (design, construction, and operations), and (3) unexpected large emissions from two organic waste management methods (composting and digesting) that were originally intended to help mitigate solid waste emissions. Our results show that remotely-sensed emission estimates reveal processes that are difficult to capture in biogas generation models. Furthermore, we find that airborne remote sensing provides an effective avenue to study the temporally changing dynamics of landfills. This capability will be further improved with future spaceborne imaging spectrometers set to launch in the 2020s.

Microwave Multiplexing on the Keck Array	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Microwave multiplexing; BICEP; Keck Array; SMuRF; Tone tracking; CMB		We describe an on-sky demonstration of a microwave-multiplexing readout system in one of the receivers of the Keck Array, a polarimetry experiment observing the cosmic microwave background at the South Pole. During the austral summer of 2018-2019, we replaced the time-division multiplexing readout system with microwave-multiplexing components including superconducting microwave resonators coupled to radio frequency superconducting quantum interference devices at the sub-Kelvin focal plane, coaxial-cable plumbing and amplification between room temperature and the cold stages, and a SLAC Microresonator Radio Frequency system for the warm electronics. In the range 5-6 GHz, a single coaxial cable reads out 528 channels. The readout system is coupled to transition-edge sensors, which are in turn coupled to 150-GHz slot-dipole phased-array antennas. Observations began in April 2019, and we report here on an initial characterization of the system performance.	[Cukierman, A.; Ahmed, Z.; Henderson, S.; Young, E.; Irwin, K.

An On-Chip Superconducting Kinetic Inductance Fourier Transform Spectrometer for Millimeter-Wave Astronomy	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Fourier transform spectrometer; Kinetic inductance; Superconducting transmission lines; Millimeter-wave astronomy	BAND	An on-chip FTS consists of two waveguides coupled to long superconducting transmission lines (STLs) (similar to 620 mm) using two coupling probes. The signal propagating on one of the STLs is phase-shifted with respect to the other line with a bias current that affects the nonlinear dependence of kinetic inductance, Lk(I)of the STL material. Here we describe the design and simulation of a superconducting on-chip FTS coupled to a dual polarization W-band (90-110 GHz) waveguide.

Multilayer Etched Antireflective Structures for Silicon Vacuum Windows	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Antireflective coating; Vacuum window; Silicon optics; Deep reactive ion etching	COATINGS; LENSES	Future instruments employing cryogenic detectors for millimeter and submillimeter astronomy applications can benefit greatly from silicon vacuum windows with broadband antireflection treatment. Silicon is an ideal optical material at these wavelengths due to numerous attractive properties, including low loss, high refractive index, and high strength. However, its high index (n=3.4necessitates antireflection (AR) treatment, which has proven a major challenge, especially for the multilayer treatments required for wide spectral bandwidths. We address this challenge by developing a wide-bandwidth integral AR structure for silicon vacuum windows using a novel fabrication technique, tuning the effective refractive index of each AR layer using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and using wafer bonding to assemble the structure. We present the progress we have made in designing and fabricating such vacuum windows from 100-mm-diameter silicon wafers. We have previously demonstrated a two-layer AR structure for windows over a 1.6:1 bandwidth and are currently fabricating a four-layer coating designed for a 4:1 bandwidth. We have also converged on a design for a six-layer structure optimized to give - 20 dB reflection between 80 and 420 GHz (5.25:1 bandwidth), which will be useful for future multicolor Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations.

Particle Response of Antenna-Coupled TES Arrays: Results from SPIDER and the Laboratory	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article						Cosmic microwave background; Transition-edge sensor; Bolometer; Cosmic ray		Future mm-wave and sub-mm space missions will employ large arrays of multiplexed transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers. Such instruments must contend with the high flux of cosmic rays beyond our atmosphere that induce 'glitches' in bolometer data, which posed a challenge to data analysis from the Planck bolometers. Future instruments will face the additional challenges of shared substrate wafers and multiplexed readout wiring. In this work, we explore the susceptibility of modern TES arrays to the cosmic ray environment of space using two data sets: the 2015 long-duration balloon flight of the SPIDER cosmic microwave background polarimeter, and a laboratory exposure of SPIDER flight hardware to radioactive sources. We find manageable glitch rates and short glitch durations, leading to minimal effect on SPIDER analysis. We constrain energy propagation within the substrate through a study of multi-detector coincidences and give a preliminary look at pulse shapes in laboratory data.	[Osherson, B.; Filippini, J.

Simulation of a Hall Effect Thruster Using Krypton Propellant	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							ELECTRON-IMPACT IONIZATION; SCATTERING CROSS-SECTIONS; XE; KR; AR	The multifluid computational framework Hall2De is updated to perform simulations of Hall thrusters operating with krypton propellant. The implementation is validated by comparison to past experimental measurements obtained for the NASA-300M thruster that operated with both xenon and krypton. For xenon, the computed thrust matches experimental values to within 6%, whereas for krypton the difference is only 1.8%. From simulations at the same thruster power level, the krypton propellant specific impulse is 15% higher than that for xenon, and the thrust is only 17% lower than that for xenon. These results are consistent with a simple theoretical calculation and experimental values. Next, the unshielded H6 thruster, which has not yet operated experimentally with krypton propellant, is also simulated for both gases at the same power level. The flow rate for krypton is reduced by 28% to maintain the 6 kW power level used for xenon propellant. The performance trends observed are consistent with the NASA-300M thruster simulations. Although the singly charged ion current fraction for xenon is 11% lower than that for krypton, for the doubly and triply charged species the trend is reversed. This behavior is expected when considering the relative differences in cross sections between the various ionization processes.

The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; CONSEQUENCES; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION; HADISDH; SUMMER; HEALTH; TRENDS	Humans' ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35 degrees C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35 degrees C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35 degrees C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35 degrees C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.

However, constraining the global and regional tropical width requires both a global spatial-resolving observational dataset and an appropriate metric to take advantage of such data. The tropical tropopause break is arguably such a metric. This study aims to evaluate the performance of different reanalyses and metrics with a focus on depicting regional tropical belt width. We choose four distinct tropopause-break metrics derived from global positioning system radio occultation (GPS-RO) satellite data and four modern reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, JRA-55, and CFSR). We show that reanalyses generally reproduce the regional tropical tropopause break to within 10 degrees of that in GPS-RO data-but that the tropical width is somewhat sensitive (within 4 degrees) to how data are averaged zonally, moderately sensitive (within 10 degrees) to the dataset resolution, and more sensitive (20 degrees over the Northern Hemisphere Atlantic Ocean during June-August) to the choice of metric. Reanalyses capture the poleward displacement of the tropical tropopause break over land and equatorward displacement over ocean during summertime, and the reverse during the wintertime. Reanalysis-based tropopause breaks are also generally well correlated with those from GPS-RO, although CFSR reproduces 14-yr trends much more closely than others (including ERA-Interim). However, it is hard to say which dataset is the best match of GPS-RO. We further find that the tropical tropopause break is representative of the subtropical jet latitude and the Northern Hemisphere edge of the Hadley circulation in terms of year-to-year variations.

We report on extensive laboratory testing and on-sky observations to quantitatively assess the instrumental radial-velocity measurement precision of EXPRES, with a focused discussion of individual terms in the instrument error budget. We find that EXPRES can reach a single-measurement instrument calibration precision better than 10 cm s(-1), not including photon noise from stellar observations. We also report on the performance of the various environmental, mechanical, and optical subsystems of EXPRES, assessing any contributions to radial-velocity error. For atmospheric and telescope related effects, this includes the fast tip-tilt guiding system, atmospheric dispersion compensation, and the chromatic exposure meter. For instrument calibration, this includes the laser fRequency comb (LFC), flat-field light source, CCD detector, and effects in the optical fibers. Modal noise is mitigated to a negligible level via a chaotic fiber agitator, which is especially important for wavelength calibration with the LFC. Regarding detector effects, we empirically assess the impact on the radial-velocity precision due to pixel-position nonuniformities and charge transfer inefficiency (CTI).

The Curious Case of PHL 293B: A Long-lived Transient in a Metal-poor Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Type II supernovae; Transient detection; Luminous blue variable stars; Blue compact dwarf galaxies; Dwarf galaxies; Galaxies	IIN SUPERNOVA; SPECTRAL EVOLUTION; OPTICAL-SPECTRA; CORONAL LINES; EMISSION; VARIABILITY; DRIVEN; SAMPLE; WIND	We report on small-amplitude optical variability and recent dissipation of the unusually persistent broad emission lines in the blue compact dwarf galaxy PHL 293B. The galaxy's unusual spectral features (P Cygni-like profiles with similar to 800 km s(-1) blueshifted absorption lines) have resulted in conflicting interpretations of the nature of this source in the literature. However, analysis of new Gemini spectroscopy reveals the broad emission has begun to fade after being persistent for over a decade prior. Precise difference imaging light curves constructed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey reveal small-amplitude optical variability of similar to 0.1 mag in the g band offset by 100 21 pc from the brightest pixel of the host. The light curve is well-described by an active galactic nuclei (AGN)-like damped random walk process. However, we conclude that the origin of the optical variability and spectral features of PHL 293B is due to a long-lived stellar transient, likely a Type IIn supernova or nonterminal outburst, mimicking long-term AGN-like variability. This work highlights the challenges of discriminating between scenarios in such extreme environments, relevant to searches for AGNs in dwarf galaxies. This is the second long-lived transient discovered in a blue compact dwarf, after SDSS1133. Our result implies such long-lived stellar transients may be more common in metal-deficient galaxies. Systematic searches for low-level variability in dwarf galaxies will be possible with the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

Smaller than Expected Bright-spot Offsets in Spitzer Phase Curves of the Hot Jupiter Qatar-1b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; EXOPLANETS	We present Spitzer full-orbit thermal phase curves of the hot Jupiter Qatar-1b, a planet with the same equilibrium temperature-and intermediate surface gravity and orbital period-as the well-studied planets HD 209458b and WASP-43b. We measure secondary eclipse depths of 0.21 0.02% at 3.6 mu m and 0.30 0.02% at 4.5 mu m, corresponding to dayside brightness temperatures of K, respectively, consistent with a vertically isothermal dayside. The respective nightside brightness temperatures are K, in line with a trend that hot Jupiters all have similar nightside temperatures. We infer a Bond albedo of and a moderate day-night heat recirculation efficiency, similar to HD 209458b. General circulation models for HD 209458b and WASP-43b predict that their bright spots should be shifted east of the substellar point by tens of degrees, and these predictions were previously confirmed with Spitzer full-orbit phase curve observations. The phase curves of Qatar-1b are likewise expected to exhibit eastward offsets. Instead, the observed phase curves are consistent with no offset: 11 degrees 7 degrees at 3.6 mu m and -4 degrees 7 degrees at 4.5 mu m. The discrepancy in circulation patterns between these three otherwise similar planets points to the importance of secondary parameters like rotation rate and surface gravity, and the presence or absence of clouds, in determining atmospheric conditions on hot Jupiters.

Optical to Near-infrared Transmission Spectrum of the Warm Sub-Saturn HAT-P-12b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet atmospheres; Exoplanet astronomy	DESCRIBING AEROSOL FORMATION; MASS DWARF STARS; GIANT PLANETS; BROWN DWARFS; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; SUPER-EARTH; CLOUD FORMATION; MINERAL CLOUDS; HD 189733B; MODEL	We present the transmission spectrum of HAT-P-12b through a joint analysis of data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Wide Field Camera 3 and Spitzer, covering the wavelength range 0.3-5.0 mu m. We detect a muted water vapor absorption feature at 1.4 mu m attenuated by clouds, as well as a Rayleigh scattering slope in the optical indicative of small particles. We interpret the transmission spectrum using both the state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval code SCARLET and the aerosol microphysics model CARMA. These models indicate that the atmosphere of HAT-P-12b is consistent with a broad range of metallicities between several tens to a few hundred times solar, a roughly solar C/O ratio, and moderately efficient vertical mixing. Cloud models that include condensate clouds do not readily generate the submicron particles necessary to reproduce the observed Rayleigh scattering slope, while models that incorporate photochemical hazes composed of soot or tholins are able to match the full transmission spectrum. From a complementary analysis of secondary eclipses by Spitzer, we obtain measured depths of 0.042% 0.013% and 0.045% 0.018% at 3.6 and 4.5 mu m, respectively, which are consistent with a blackbody temperature of 890(-70)(+60) K and indicate efficient day-night heat recirculation.

In addition, it provides constraints on surface texture uncertainties associated with landing, anchoring, surface trafficability, and sampling. Herein, we present how orbital bistatic radar (BSR) observations can be successfully conducted during occultations, and thereby used to achieve the above scientific and technical objectives for key planetary bodies that are under investigation by current and future missions. For different planetary bodies without dense atmospheres, we calculate the theoretical differential Doppler shift (delta f) between the direct and surface-scattered signals that precede and follow radio occultations during opportunistic BSR experiments. For occultations that last similar to 10 min, we find that small bodies with diameters less than or similar to 100 km will exhibit vertical bar delta f vertical bar less than or similar to 5 Hz, and larger bodies with diameters greater than or similar to 500 km will have vertical bar delta f vertical bar greater than or similar to 50 Hz. Our results suggest that opportunistic BSR observations of targets less than or similar to 100 km in diameter will require an ultrastable oscillator (USO) aboard the spacecraft to retrieve surface echoes and constrain surface roughness.

Deep Learning Calibration of the High-Frequency Airborne Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Radiometer (HAMMR) Instrument	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Airborne; calibration; deep learning; microwave radiometer; millimeter-wave radiometer; neural network; remote sensing	SATELLITES	Calibration plays an important role in improving the accuracy of the microwave and millimeter-wave radiometric measurements. Several calibration techniques have been used in radiometers including external calibration targets, vicarious sources, and internal calibrators such as noise diodes or matched reference load. A new calibration technique based on deep learning has recently been developed to calibrate microwave and millimeter-wave radiometers. The deep-learning calibrator has been previously demonstrated on a computer noise-wave modeled Dicke-switching radiometer. This article applies the new deep-learning calibration technique for the calibration of the high-frequency airborne microwave and millimeter-wave radiometer (HAMMR) instrument. A deep-learning neural network model is built to calibrate the 2014 West Coast Flight Campaign antenna temperature measurements of the HAMMR. The deep-learning calibrator antenna temperature estimates are obtained from the radiometric measurements. The deep-learning calibration results are compared with the existing conventional calibration techniques used in HAMMR 2014 field campaign. The results have shown that the deep-learning calibrator is in agreement with the conventional calibration techniques. In this article, it is demonstrated that the deep-learning calibrator can be employed for calibrating the radiometers with high accuracy.

Into the UV: A Precise Transmission Spectrum of HAT-P-41b Using Hubble's WFC3/UVIS G280 Grism	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet atmospheres; Near ultraviolet astronomy; Hubble Space Telescope	EXOPLANETS; CLOUDS; WATER	The ultraviolet-visible wavelength range holds critical spectral diagnostics for the chemistry and physics at work in planetary atmospheres. To date, time-series studies of exoplanets to characterize their atmospheres have relied on several combinations of modes on the Hubble Space Telescope's STIS/COS instruments to access this wavelength regime. Here for the first time, we apply the Hubble WFC3/UVIS G280 grism mode to obtain exoplanet spectroscopy from 200 to 800 nm in a single observation. We test the G280 grism mode on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-41b over two consecutive transits to determine its viability for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We obtain a broadband transit depth precision of 29-33 ppm and a precision of on average 200 ppm in 10 nm spectroscopic bins. Spectral information from the G280 grism can be extracted from both the positive and negative first-order spectra, resulting in a 60% increase in the measurable flux. Additionally, the first Hubble Space Telescope orbit can be fully utilized in the time-series analysis. We present detailed extraction and reduction methods for use by future investigations with this mode, testing multiple techniques. We find the results to be fully consistent with STIS measurements of HAT-P-41b from 310 to 800 nm, with the G280 results representing a more observationally efficient and precise spectrum. HAT-P-41b's transmission spectrum is best fit with a model with T-eq = 2091 K, high metallicity, and significant scattering and cloud opacity. With these first-of-their-kind observations, we demonstrate that WFC3/UVIS G280 is a powerful new tool to obtain UV-optical spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, adding to the UV legacy of Hubble and complementing future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope.

Retrieving global surface soil moisture from GRACE satellite gravity data	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						GRACE; SMAP; SMOS; Terrestrial water storage; Soil moisture; Richards' equation	L-BAND; WATER; SMOS; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; VALIDATION; PRODUCTS; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; IRRIGATION	Passive microwave radiometry from space through missions such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites is the most reliable means for mapping global surface soil moisture (SSM). Nonetheless, microwave SSM retrievals are uncertain over densely vegetated surfaces or areas with high radio frequency interference. This paper presents a new observationally driven approach to remote sensing of global SSM based on the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) data acquired from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. This approach rests on a physically based, yet parsimonious, model based on the Richards' equation and the assumption that the TWSA temporal rate of change (dS/dt) approximates the land surface net water flux (NWF) as the surface boundary condition. The GRACE-based SSM is found to be in a reasonable agreement with in-situ data and highly correlated with the SMAP and SMOS retrievals, especially over wet regions where the assumption of NWF approximate to dS/dt holds valid. The GRACE retrievals contain new SSM information relative to the microwave satellite data and provide a potential solution to improve the microwave data over densely vegetated surfaces or areas with high radio frequency interference.

Application of machine learning to hyperspectral radiative transfer simulations	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Radiative transfer; Hyperspectral; Machine learning; Principal component analysis	TRANSFER MODEL; ABSORPTION; PREDICTION; O-2	Hyperspectral observations have become one of the most popular and powerful methods for atmospheric remote sensing, and are widely used for temperature, gas, aerosol, and cloud retrievals. However, accurate forward radiative transfer simulations are computationally expensive since typical line-by-line approaches involve a large number of monochromatic radiative transfer calculations. This study explores the feasibility of machine learning techniques (using neural network (NN) as an example) for fast hyperspectral radiative transfer simulations, by performing calculations at a small fraction of hyperspectral wavelengths and extending them across the entire spectral range. Results from the NN model are compared with those from a principal component analysis (PCA) model, which uses a similar principle of dimensionality reduction. We consider hyperspectral radiances from both actual satellite observations and accurate line-by-line simulations. The NN model can alleviate the computational burden by two to three orders of magnitude, and generate radiances with small relative errors (generally less than 0.5% compared to exact calculations); the performance of the NN model is better than that of the PCA model. The model can be further improved by optimizing the training procedure and parameters, the representative wavelengths, and the machine learning technique itself. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However their next predicted mid-transit time could become so increasingly uncertain over time that significant overhead would be required to ensure the detection of the entire transit. As a result, follow-up observations to characterize these exoplanetary atmospheres would require less-efficient use of an observatory's time-which is an issue for large platforms where minimizing observing overheads is a necessity. Here we demonstrate the power of citizen scientists operating smaller observatories (<= 1 m) to keep ephemerides "fresh," defined here as when the 1 sigma uncertainty in the mid-transit time is less than half the transit duration. We advocate for the creation of a community-wide effort to perform ephemeris maintenance on transiting exoplanets by citizen scientists. Such observations can be conducted with even a 6 inch telescope, which has the potential to save up to similar to 10,000 days for a 1000-planet survey. Based on a preliminary analysis of 14 transits from a single 6 inch MicroObservatory telescope, we empirically estimate the ability of small telescopes to benefit the community. Observations with a small-telescope network operated by citizen scientists are capable of resolving stellar blends to within 5 ''/pixel, can follow-up long period transits in short-baseline TESS fields, monitor epoch-to-epoch stellar variability at a precision 0.67% 0.12% for a 11.3 V-mag star, and search for new planets or constrain the masses of known planets with transit timing variations greater than two minutes.

QUEST: A New Frontiers Uranus orbiter mission concept study	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Uranus; Planetary science summer seminar; Ice giants; Orbiter mission concept study; New frontiers	MAGNETIC RECONNECTION; MESSENGER OBSERVATIONS; DEEP ATMOSPHERE; NEPTUNE; RADIO; WATER; FIELD; MAGNETOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; AMMONIA	The ice giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are fundamentally different from the gas giant and terrestrial planets. Though ice giants represent the most common size of exoplanet and possess characteristics that challenge our understanding of the way our solar system formed and evolved, they remain the only class of planetary object without a dedicated spacecraft mission. The inclusion of a Uranus orbiter as the third highest priority Flagship mission in the NASA Planetary Science Decadal Survey "Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022" indicates a high level of support for exploration of the ice giants by the planetary science community. However, given the substantial costs associated with a flagship mission, it is critical to explore lower cost options if we intend to visit Uranus within an ideal launch window of 2029-2034 when a Jupiter gravity assist becomes available. In this paper, we describe the Quest to Uranus to Explore Solar System Theories (QUEST), a New Frontiers class Uranus orbiter mission concept study performed at the 30th Annual NASA/JPL Planetary Science Summer Seminar. The proposed QUEST platform is a spin-stabilized spacecraft designed to undergo highly elliptical, polar orbits around Uranus during a notional one-year primary science mission. The proposed major science goals of the mission are (1) to use Uranus as a natural laboratory to better understand the dynamos that drive magnetospheres in the solar system and beyond and (2) to identify the energy transport mechanisms in Uranus' magnetic, atmospheric, and interior environments in contrast with the other giant planets. With substantial mass, power, and cost margins, this mission concept demonstrates a compelling, feasible option for a New Frontiers Uranus orbiter mission.

This paper presents high-resolution sulfur dioxide (SO2) maps over the Korean Peninsula, produced by SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO measurements during the Korea-United States Air Quality Field Study (KORUS-AQ) from May to June 2016. The highly sensitive GeoTASO instrument with a spatial resolution of similar to 250 m x 250 m can detect point emission sources of SO2 within its fields of view, even without merging multiple overlapping observations. To retrieve SO2 vertical columns from the GeoTASO measurements, we apply an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA), which is effective in suppressing noise and biases in SO2 retrievals. The retrievals successfully capture SO2 plumes and various point sources such as power plants, a petrochemical complex, and a steel mill, located in South Chungcheong Province, some of which are not detected by a ground-based in situ measurement network. Spatial distributions of SO2 from GeoTASO observations in source areas are consistent with those from the Stack Tele-Monitoring System reports and airborne in situ SO2 measurements. Comparisons of SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO and existing satellite sensors demonstrate the significance of high-resolution SO2 observations, by indicating that GeoTASO detects small SO2 emission sources that are not precisely resolved by single overpasses of satellites. To assess future geostationary SO2 observations having a higher spatial resolution, we upscale the GeoTASO SO2 retrievals to a spatial resolution of the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). Since the upscaled GeoTASO retrievals also detect SO2 plumes clearly, we expect from GEMS to identify even small SO2 emission sources over Asia.

Apparent canopy SIF yield (SIFyield apparent), determined by fluorescence yield (Phi(F)) and escaping ratio (f(esc)), together with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), is crucial in driving spatio-temporal variability of SIF. While strong linkages between SIFyield apparent and plant physiological responses and canopy structure have been suggested, spatio-temporal variability of SIFyield apparent at regional scale remains largely unclear, which limits our understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of SIF and its relationship with photosynthesis. In this study, we utilized recent SIF data with high spatial resolution from two satellite instruments, OCO-2 and TROPOMI, together with multiple other datasets. We estimated SIFyield apparent across space, time, and different vegetation types in the U.S. Midwest during crop growing season (May to September) from 2015 to 2018. We found that SIFyield apparent of croplands was larger than non-croplands during peak season (July-August). However, SIFyield apparent between corn (C4 crop) and soybean (C3 crop) did not show a significant difference. SIFyield apparent of corn, soybean, forest, and grass/pasture show clear seasonal and spatial patterns. The spatial variability of precipitation during the growing season could explain the overall spatial pattern of SIFyield apparent. Further analysis by decomposing SIFyield apparent into Phi(F) and f(esc) using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) suggests that fesc may be the major driver of the observed variability of SIFyield apparent.

In order to exploit the full range of unprecedented observational capabilities of VIIRS, we have developed a nighttime shortwave radiative transfer model capability in the UNified and Linearized Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM). This capability is based on the use of additional source functions to treat illumination from the Moon, from fires, and from artificial lights. We have applied this model to address fundamental questions associated with the VIIRS sensing of aerosol and fire at night. Detailed description of model developments and validation (either directly with surface measurements of lunar spectra or indirectly through cross validation) are presented. Our analysis reveals that: (a) when convolution with the broad-range (500-900 nm) relative spectral response (RSR) function of the VIIRS Day-Night Band (DNB) is omitted, AOD retrieval from the DNB have uncertainties up to a factor of two in conditions with low or moderate AOD (<0.5 in mid-visible); (b) using a wavelength independent spectrum for the surface illumination source can lead to an AOD bias of -10% over surfaces illuminated by light-emitting diodes and fluorescent lamps, and -30% illuminated by high-pressure sodium lamps; and (c) a DNB-equivalent narrow band for AOD retrieval over the surfaces illuminated by the three types of bulbs studied in this paper is found to be centered at 585 nm at which the look-up table can be generated for AOD retrieval from DNB. Furthermore, while uncertainty in AOD retrievals from the DNB decreases as AOD increases, fire characterization can be affected by AOD; for a smoke-scenario AOD of 2.0, the DNB and SWIR (1.6 mu m) radiances can be reduced by 50% depending on the fire area fraction and temperature within VIIRS pixel. DNB is overall more sensitive to smaller and cooler fires than SWIR and can be used to retrieve AOD over bright surfaces. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer effects and the non-collimated nature of most artificial light sources are neglected in this 1D radiative transfer (plane-parallel) model, resulting in possibly large uncertainties (e.g., the inability to reproduce side-illumination of clouds by city lights) that should be studied in future.

Europa's surface water ice crystallinity: Discrepancy between observations and thermophysical and particle flux modeling	ICARUS			English	Article						Europa; Ices; IR spectroscopy; Satellites; Surfaces	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTRA; SOLAR-SYSTEM SURFACES; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; SUBSURFACE OCEAN; AMORPHOUS ICE; CRYOVOLCANISM; SPECTROSCOPY; H2O-ICE; STATE; FROST	Physical processing of Europan surface water ice by thermal relaxation, charged particle bombardment, and possible cryovolcanic activity can alter the percentage of the crystalline form of water ice compared to that of the amorphous form of water ice (the "crystallinity") on Europa's surface. The timescales over which amorphous water ice is thermally transformed to crystalline water ice at Europan surface temperatures (80-130 K) suggests that the water ice there should be primarily in the crystalline form, however, surface bombardment by charged particles induced by Jupiter's magnetic field, and vapor deposition of water ice from Europan plumes, can produce amorphous water ice surface deposits on short timescales. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the Europan surface water ice crystallinity derived from ground-based spectroscopic measurements is in agreement with the crystallinity expected based upon temperature and radiation modeling. Using a 1D thermophysical model of Europa's surface, we calculate an integrated full-disk crystallinity of Europa's leading hemisphere by incorporating the thermal relaxation of amorphous to crystalline water ice and the degradation of crystalline to amorphous water ice by irradiation. Concurrently, we derive the full-disk crystallinity of Europa's leading hemisphere using a comparison of near-infrared ground-based spectral observations from Grundy et al. (1999), Busarev et al. (2018), and the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, NM, with laboratory spectra from Mastrapa et al. (2008) and the Ice Spectroscopy Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We calculate a modeled crystallinity significantly higher than crystallinities derived from ground-based observations and laboratory spectra. This discrepancy may be a result of geophysical processes, such as by vapor-deposited plume material, or it may arise from assumptions and uncertainties in the crystallinity calculations.

A multiannual record of gravity wave activity in Mars's lower atmosphere from on-planet observations by the Mars Climate Sounder	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars, atmosphere; Atmospheres, dynamics; Infrared observations; Meteorology; Mars, climate	CONVECTIVE BOUNDARY-LAYER; RADIO OCCULTATION MEASUREMENTS; DETACHED DUST LAYERS; WATER ICE CLOUDS; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE; GLOBAL-SURVEYOR; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION; DEEP CONVECTION	Gravity waves in Mars's atmosphere strongly affect the general circulation as well as middle atmospheric cloud formation, but the climatology and sources of gravity waves in the lower atmosphere remain poorly understood. At Earth, the statistical variance in satellite observations of thermal emission above the instrumental noise floor has been used to enable measurement of gravity wave activity at a global scale. Here is presented an analysis of variance in calibrated radiance at 15.4 mu m (635-665 cm(-1)) from off-nadir and nadir observations by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO); a major expansion in the observational data available for validating models of Martian gravity wave activity. These observations are sensitive to gravity waves at 20-30 km altitude with wavelength properties (lambda(h)=10-100 km, lambda(z) > 5 km) that make them likely to affect the dynamics of the middle and upper atmosphere. We find that: (1) strong, moderately intermittent gravity wave activity is scattered over the tropical volcanoes and throughout the middle to high latitudes of both hemispheres during fall and winter, (2) gravity wave activity noticeably departs from climatology during regional and global dust storms; and (3) strong, intermittent variance is observed at night in parts of the southern tropics during its fall/winter, but frequent CO2 ice clouds prevents unambiguous attribution to GW activity. The spatial distribution of wave activity is consistent with topographic sources being dominant, but contributions from boundary layer convection and other convective processes are possible.

Infrared observations of Io from Juno	ICARUS			English	Article							ADAPTIVE OPTICS OBSERVATIONS; VOLCANIC ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; ABSORPTION FEATURES; 100 NIGHTS; HEAT-FLOW; WATER-ICE; MU-M; SURFACE; TEMPERATURE	The Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) on board the NASA Juno spacecraft is a dual-band imager and spectrometer, primarily designed to study the Jovian atmosphere and aurorae. In addition to its primary goal, JIRAM has been used to obtain images and spectra of the Galilean satellites, Jupiter's largest moons, when the spacecraft attitude was favourable to achieve this goal. Here we present JIRAM's first images and spectra of Io. These observations are used to characterize the location and possible morphology, and some temperatures, of Io's volcanic thermal sources; the identification of SO2 and the possible identification of other materials. A new hot spot/volcano is identified close to the South Pole of Io, and others are seen in lower latitude regions, which were previously unmapped. Images of the same region taken 2 months apart also show variations of hot spot intensity, possibly due to new lava flows or to lava flow breakouts.

Temperature-induced shape morphing of bi-metallic structures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Adaptive structures; Architected solids; Extreme thermal expansion; Displacement amplification mechanisms; Environment-triggered morphing; Space structures	LOW THERMAL-EXPANSION; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; LATTICES	In this work, we study the thermo-mechanical behavior of metallic structures designed to significantly change shape in response to thermal stimuli. This behavior is achieved by arranging two metals with different coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), Aluminum and Titanium, as to create displacement-amplifying units that can expand uniaxially. In particular, our design comprises a low-CTE bar surrounded by a high-CTE frame that features flexure hinges and thicker links. When the temperature increases, the longitudinal expansion of the high-CTE portion is geometrically constrained by the low-GE bar, resulting in a large tangential displacement Our design is guided by theoretical models and numerical simulations. We validate our approach by fabricating and characterizing individual units, one dimensional arrays and three-dimensional structures. Our work shows that structurally robust metallic structures can be designed for large shape changes. The results also demonstrate how harsh environmental conditions (e.g., the extreme temperature swings that are characteristic of extraterrestrial environments) can be leveraged to produce function in a fully passive way.

A family portrait of disk inner rims around Herbig Ae/Be stars Hunting for warps, rings, self shadowing, and misalignments in the inner astronomical units	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: variables: T Tauri, Herbig Ae/Be; techniques: interferometric; techniques: high angular resolution; protoplanetary disks; circumstellar matter; stars: pre-main sequence	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; AE STARS; DUST	Context. The innermost astronomical unit (au) in protoplanetary disks is a key region for stellar and planet formation, as exoplanet searches have shown a large occurrence of close-in planets that are located within the first au around their host star. Aims. We aim to reveal the morphology of the disk inner rim using near-infrared interferometric observations with milli-arcsecond resolution provided by near-infrared multitelescope interferometry. Methods. We provide model-independent reconstructed images of 15 objects selected from the Herbig AeBe survey carried out with PIONIER at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, using the semi-parametric approach for image reconstruction of chromatic objects. We propose a set of methods to reconstruct and analyze the images in a consistent way. Results. We find that 40% of the systems (6/15) are centrosymmetric at the angular resolution of the observations. For the rest of the objects, we find evidence for asymmetric emission due to moderate-to-strong inclination of a disk-like structure for similar to 30% of the objects (5/15) and noncentrosymmetric morphology due to a nonaxisymmetric and possibly variable environment (4/15, similar to 27%). Among the systems with a disk-like structure, 20% (3/15) show a resolved dust-free cavity. Finally, we do not detect extended emission beyond the inner rim. Conclusions. The image reconstruction process is a powerful tool to reveal complex disk inner rim morphologies, which is complementary to the fit of geometrical models. At the angular resolution reached by near-infrared interferometric observations, most of the images are compatible with a centrally peaked emission (no cavity). For the most resolved targets, image reconstruction reveals morphologies that cannot be reproduced by generic parametric models (e.g., perturbed inner rims or complex brightness distributions). Moreover, the nonaxisymmetric disks show that the spatial resolution probed by optical interferometers makes the observations of the near-infrared emission (inside a few au) sensitive to temporal evolution with a time-scale down to a few weeks. The evidence of nonaxisymmetric emission that cannot be explained by simple inclination and radiative transfer effects requires alternative explanations, such as a warping of the inner disks. Interferometric observations can therefore be used to follow the evolution of the asymmetry of those disks at an au or sub-au scale.

Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember's microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember's skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember's microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

J	Mas-Ribas, L; Chang, TC				Mas-Ribas, Lluis; Chang, Tzu-Ching			Lyman-alpha polarization intensity mapping	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SCATTERED LY-ALPHA; MICROWAVE BACKGROUND POLARIZATION; HIGH-REDSHIFT; GALAXY FORMATION; RADIO GALAXIES; LINE; EMISSION; RADIATION; HALO; HYDROGEN	We present a formalism that incorporates hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Ly alpha) polarization arising from the scattering of radiation in galaxy halos into the intensity mapping approach. Using the halo model, and Ly alpha emission profiles based on simulations and observations, we calculate auto and cross power spectra at redshifts 3 <= z <= 13 for the Ly alpha total intensity, I, polarized intensity, P, degree of polarization, Pi = P/I, and two new quantities, the astrophysical E and B modes of Ly alpha polarization. The one-halo terms of the. power spectra show a turnover that signals the average extent of the polarization signal, and thus the extent of the scattering medium. The position of this feature depends on redshift, as well as on the specific emission profile shape and extent, in our formalism. Therefore, the comparison of various Ly alpha polarization quantities and redshifts can break degeneracies between competing effects, and it can reveal the true shape of the emission profiles, which, in turn, are associated to the physical properties of the cool gas in galaxy halos. Furthermore, measurements of Ly alpha E and B modes may be used as probes of galaxy evolution, because they are related to the average degree of anisotropy in the emission and in the halo gas distribution across redshifts. The detection of the polarization signal at z similar to 3-5 requires improvements in the sensitivity of current ground-based experiments by a factor of similar to 10, and of similar to 100 for space-based instruments targeting the redshifts z similar to 9-10, the exact values depending on the specific redshift and experiment. Interloper contamination in polarization is expected to be small, because the interlopers need to also be polarized. Overall, Ly alpha polarization boosts the amount of physical information retrievable on galaxies and their surroundings, most of it not achievable with total emission alone.

Simulating White-Light Images of Coronal Structures for Parker Solar Probe/WISPR: Study of the Total Brightness Profiles	SOLAR PHYSICS			English	Article						Corona	MASS	The Wide-field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR) captures unprecedented white-light images of the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Thanks to the uniqueness of the Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) orbit, WISPR is able to image "locally" coronal structures at high spatial and time resolutions. The observed plane of sky, however, rapidly changes because of the PSP's high orbital speed. Therefore, the interpretation of the dynamics of the coronal structures recorded by WISPR is not straightforward. A first study, undertaken by Liewer et al. (Solar Phys.294, 93, 2019), shows how different coronal features (e.g., streamers, flux ropes) appear in the field-of-view of WISPR by means of raytracing simulations. In particular, they analyze the effects of the spatial resolution changes on both the images and the associated height-time maps, and introduce the fundamentals for geometric triangulation. In this follow-up paper, we focus on the study of the total brightness of a simple, spherical, plasma density structure, to understand how the analysis of Thomson-scattered emission by the electrons in a coronal feature can shed light into the determination of its kinematic properties. We investigate two cases: (i) a density sphere at a constant distance from the Sun for different heliographic longitudes; (ii) a density sphere moving outwardly with constant speed. The study allows us to characterize the effects of the varying heliocentric distance of the observer and scattering angle on the total brightness observed, which we exploit to contribute to a better determination of the position and speed of the coronal features observed by WISPR.

Here, the annual double-ITCZ bias and the associated precipitation bias in the latest climate models for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phase 6 (CMIP6) are examined in comparison to their previous generations (CMIP Phase 3 [CMIP3] and CMIP Phase 5 [CMIP5]). All three generations of CMIP models share similar systematic annual multi-model ensemble mean precipitation errors in the tropics. The notorious double-ITCZ bias and its big inter-model spread persist in CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models. Based on several tropical precipitation bias indices, the double-ITCZ bias is slightly reduced from CMIP3 or CMIP5 to CMIP6. In addition, the annual equatorial Pacific cold tongue persists in all three generations of CMIP models, but its inter-model spread is reduced from CMIP3 to CMIP5 and from CMIP5 to CMIP6.

For both ice sheets, we find consistent GRACE/GRACE-FO time series across the data gap, at the continental and regional scales, and the data gap is confidently filled with mass budget method data. In Greenland, the GRACE-FO data reveal an exceptional summer loss of 600 Gt in 2019 following two cold summers. In Antarctica, ongoing high mass losses in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, the Antarctic Peninsula, and Wilkes Land in East Antarctica cumulate to 2130, 560, and 370 Gt, respectively, since 2002. A cumulative mass gain of 980 Gt in Queen Maud Land since 2009, however, led to a pause in the acceleration in mass loss from Antarctica after 2016.

Unlike early-season photosynthesis, which is mostly driven by temperature or wet-season onset, late-season photosynthesis can be limited by several factors and the underlying mechanisms are less understood. Here, we analyze the temperature and water limitations on the ending date of photosynthesis (EOP), using data from both remote-sensing and flux tower-based measurements. We find a contrasting spatial pattern of temperature and water limitations on EOP. The threshold separating these is determined by the balance between energy availability and soil water supply. This coordinated temperature and moisture regulation can be explained by "law of minimum," i.e., as temperature limitation diminishes, higher soil water is needed to support increased vegetation activity, especially during the late growing season. Models project future warming and drying, especially during late season, both of which should further expand the water-limited regions, causing large variations and potential decreases in photosynthesis.

Euclid: The reduced shear approximation and magnification bias for Stage IV cosmic shear experiments	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; cosmology: observations; methods: analytical	DARK ENERGY; WEAK; CONSTRAINTS; STATISTICS; MATTER	Context. Stage IV weak lensing experiments will offer more than an order of magnitude leap in precision. We must therefore ensure that our analyses remain accurate in this new era. Accordingly, previously ignored systematic effects must be addressed.Aims. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the reduced shear approximation and magnification bias on information obtained from the angular power spectrum. To first-order, the statistics of reduced shear, a combination of shear and convergence, are taken to be equal to those of shear. However, this approximation can induce a bias in the cosmological parameters that can no longer be neglected. A separate bias arises from the statistics of shear being altered by the preferential selection of galaxies and the dilution of their surface densities in high-magnification regions.Methods. The corrections for these systematic effects take similar forms, allowing them to be treated together. We calculated the impact of neglecting these effects on the cosmological parameters that would be determined from Euclid, using cosmic shear tomography. To do so, we employed the Fisher matrix formalism, and included the impact of the super-sample covariance. We also demonstrate how the reduced shear correction can be calculated using a lognormal field forward modelling approach.Results. These effects cause significant biases in Omega (m), sigma (8), n(s), Omega (DE), w(0), and w(a) of -0.53 sigma, 0.43 sigma, -0.34 sigma, 1.36 sigma, -0.68 sigma, and 1.21 sigma, respectively. We then show that these lensing biases interact with another systematic effect: the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. Accordingly, we have developed the formalism for an intrinsic alignment-enhanced lensing bias correction. Applying this to Euclid, we find that the additional terms introduced by this correction are sub-dominant.	[Deshpande, A. C.; Kitching, T. D.; Taylor, P.

Getz Ice Shelf melt enhanced by freshwater discharge from beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; ICEBRIDGE GRAVITY; BATHYMETRY; GLACIER; SURFACE; MODEL; THICKNESS; MELTWATER; SEDIMENT; DRAINAGE	Antarctica's Getz Ice Shelf has been rapidly thinning in recent years, producing more meltwater than any other ice shelf in the world. The influx of fresh water is known to substantially influence ocean circulation and biological productivity, but relatively little is known about the factors controlling basal melt rate or how basal melt is spatially distributed beneath the ice shelf. Also unknown is the relative importance of subglacial discharge from the grounded ice sheet in contributing to the export of fresh water from the ice shelf cavity. Here we compare the observed spatial distribution of basal melt rate to a new sub-ice-shelf bathymetry map inferred from airborne gravity surveys and to locations of subglacial discharge from the grounded ice sheet. We find that melt rates are high where bathymetric troughs provide a pathway for warm Circumpolar Deep Water to enter the ice shelf cavity and that melting is enhanced where subglacial discharge fresh water flows across the grounding line. This is the first study to address the relative importance of meltwater production of the Getz Ice Shelf from both ocean and subglacial sources.

Recent studies have demonstrated long lead-time correlations between pre-fire-season hydrological variables such as soil moisture and later fire occurrence or area burned, yet the potential value of these relationships for operational forecasting has not been studied. Here, we use soil moisture data refined by remote sensing observations of terrestrial water storage from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and vapor pressure deficit from NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission to generate monthly predictions of fire danger at scales commensurate with regional management. We test the viability of predictors within nine US geographic area coordination centers (GACCs) using regression models specific to each GACC. Results show that the model framework improves interannual wildfire-burned-area prediction relative to climatology for all GACCs. This demonstrates the importance of hydrological information to extend operational forecast ability into the months preceding wildfire activity.	[Farahmand, Alireza; Stavros, E.

Competing effects of soil fertility and toxicity on tropical greening	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; ALUMINUM TOXICITY; AMAZON FOREST; LEAF-AREA; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; NITROGEN LIMITATION	Tropical forests are expected to green up with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but primary productivity may be limited by soil nutrient availability. However, rarely have canopy-scale measurements been assessed against soil measurements in the tropics. Here, we sought to assess remotely sensed canopy greenness against steep soil nutrient gradients across 50 1-ha mature forest plots in Panama. Contrary to expectations, increases in in situ extractable soil phosphorus (P) and base cations (K, Mg) corresponded to declines in remotely sensed mean annual canopy greenness (r(2)=0.77-0.85; p<0.1), controlling for precipitation. The reason for this inverse relationship appears to be that litterfall also increased with increasing soil P and cation availability (r(2)=0.88-0.98; p<0.1), resulting in a decline in greenness with increasing annual litterfall (r(2)=0.94; p<0.1). As such, greater soil nutrient availability corresponded to greater leaf turnover, resulting in decreased greenness. However, these decreases in greenness with increasing soil P and cations were countered by increases in greenness with increasing soil nitrogen (N) (r(2)=0.14; p<0.1), which had no significant relationship with litterfall, likely reflecting a direct effect of soil N on leaf chlorophyll content, but not on litterfall rates. In addition, greenness increased with extractable soil aluminum (Al) (r(2)=0.97; p<0.1), but Al had no significant relationship with litterfall, suggesting a physiological adaptation of plants to high levels of toxic metals. Thus, spatial gradients in canopy greenness are not necessarily positive indicators of soil nutrient scarcity. Using a novel remote sensing index of canopy greenness limitation, we assessed how observed greenness compares with potential greenness. We found a strong relationship with soil N only (r(2)=0.65; p<0.1), suggesting that tropical canopy greenness in Panama is predominantly limited by soil N, even if plant productivity (e.g., litterfall) responds to rock-derived nutrients. Moreover, greenness limitation was also significantly correlated with fine root biomass and soil carbon stocks (r(2)=0.62-0.71; p<0.1), suggesting a feedback from soil N to canopy greenness to soil carbon storage. Overall, these data point to the potential utility of a remote sensing product for assessing belowground properties in tropical ecosystems.

Euclid: Nonparametric point spread function field recovery through interpolation on a graph Laplacian & x22c6;	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						cosmology; observations; gravitational lensing; weak; methods; numerical; techniques; image processing	SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; SHEAR ESTIMATION; LENSING ANALYSIS; DARK ENERGY; WEAK; REQUIREMENTS; SEXTRACTOR	Context. Future weak lensing surveys, such as the Euclid mission, will attempt to measure the shapes of billions of galaxies in order to derive cosmological information. These surveys will attain very low levels of statistical error, and systematic errors must be extremely well controlled. In particular, the point spread function (PSF) must be estimated using stars in the field, and recovered with high accuracy. Aims. The aims of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we took steps toward a nonparametric method to address the issue of recovering the PSF field, namely that of finding the correct PSF at the position of any galaxy in the field, applicable to Euclid. Our approach relies solely on the data, as opposed to parametric methods that make use of our knowledge of the instrument. Secondly, we studied the impact of imperfect PSF models on the shape measurement of galaxies themselves, and whether common assumptions about this impact hold true in an Euclid scenario. Methods. We extended the recently proposed resolved components analysis approach, which performs super-resolution on a field of under-sampled observations of a spatially varying, image-valued function. We added a spatial interpolation component to the method, making it a true 2-dimensional PSF model. We compared our approach to PSFEx, then quantified the impact of PSF recovery errors on galaxy shape measurements through image simulations. Results. Our approach yields an improvement over PSFEx in terms of the PSF model and on observed galaxy shape errors, though it is at present far from reaching the required Euclid accuracy. We also find that the usual formalism used for the propagation of PSF model errors to weak lensing quantities no longer holds in the case of an Euclid-like PSF. In particular, different shape measurement approaches can react differently to the same PSF modeling errors.	[Schmitz, M.

However, ground-based atmospheric CO2 measurements covering the diverse landscape across the city are still limited. This study utilizes the column integrated CO2 concentration (XCO2) data obtained from the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to evaluate urban CO2 enhancements over Seoul Capital Area (SCA) of South Korea for the period 2014-2018. In this study, Jirisan National Park (JNP), which is the cleanest area on the same orbit track with SCA, is defined as the background area considering its strong vegetation activity and low anthropogenic carbon emissions. By comparing XCO2 between SCA and JNP based on wind speed, we find an apparent increase in XCO2 by 1.71 to 2.21 ppm over SCA only on the days with wind speed less than 4 m s(-1). Strong wind speed (e.g., over 4 m s(-1)) disrupts the identification of XCO2 enhancements over SCA due to atmospheric mixing between SCA and JNP. In addition, we compare estimated XCO2 differences between SCA and JNP from OCO-2 with other low-resolution data. This increase in XCO2 over SCA is only observed in OCO-2. Overall, our results suggest that high-resolution satellite remote sensing of XCO2 constrained by wind speed has strong potential to open up the possibility of identifying atmospheric CO2 enhancements in the city where ground-based observations are limited.

With their remarkable quantum properties, such as long room-temperature spin coherence and the possibility of downscaling to single-photon-source level, they have proven to be promising candidates for a multitude of quantum-information applications. One of the most crucial parameters of any quantum system is how long its quantum coherence can be preserved. By using the pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) technique, we investigate the spin-lattice relaxation time (T-1) and spin-coherence time (T-2) of silicon vacancies in 4H-SiC created by neutron, electron, and proton irradiation in a broad range of fluences. We also examine the effect of irradiation energy and sample annealing. We establish a robustness of the T-1 time against all types of irradiation and reveal a universal scaling of the T-2 time with the emitter density. Our results can be used to optimize the coherence properties of silicon-vacancy qubits in SiC for specific tasks.

The current synthesis of process-based estimates of land and ocean sinks requires an additional sink of 0.6PgC yr(-1) in the last decade to explain the observed airborne fraction. A concurrent global fire decline was observed in association with tropical agriculture expansion and landscape fragmentation. Here we show that a decline of 0.20.1PgC yr(-1) in fire emissions during 2008-2014 relative to 2001-2007 also induced an additional carbon sink enhancement of 0.4 +/- 0.2PgC yr(-1) attributable to carbon cycle feedbacks, amounting to a combined sink increase comparable to the 0.6PgC yr(-1) budget imbalance. Our results suggest that the indirect effects of fire, in addition to the direct emissions, is an overlooked mechanism for explaining decadal-scale changes in the land carbon sink and highlight the importance of fire management in climate mitigation. p id=Par In recent history the amount of carbon captured by terrestrial systems has increased, but the processes driving this process has remained poorly constrained. Here the authors use a global carbon model to show that a decrease in wildfires has caused the land carbon sink to increase in the past few decades.

NOV.; PROBIOTICS; PEROXIDE	Background Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Results Streptococcus was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria which increased during flight and Actinobacteria which decreased during flight. At the genus level, Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with Gracilibacteria, Absconditabacteria, and Abiotrophia and a negative correlation between Oribacterium, Veillonella, and Haemophilus. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers. Conclusions This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.

However, the generation of mid-infrared (mid-IR) frequency combs with gigahertz line spacing as required to resolve many gas spectra represents a significant challenge for these devices. Here, a technique referred to as interleaved difference-frequency generation (iDFG) is introduced that densifies the spectral line spacing upon conversion of near-IR comb light into the mid-IR light. A soliton microcomb is used as both a comb light source and microwave oscillator in a demonstration, and the spectrum of methane is measured to illustrate how the resulting mid-IR comb avoids spectral undersampling. Beyond demonstration of the iDFG technique, this work represents an important feasibility step towards more compact and potentially chip-based mid-IR gas spectroscopy modules.

The carbon monoxide-rich interstellar comet 2I/Borisov	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article; Early Access							ABUNDANCES; SPECTRA	Interstellar comets offer direct samples of volatiles from distant protoplanetary disks. 2I/Borisov is the first notably active interstellar comet discovered in our Solar System(1). Comets are condensed samples of the gas, ice and dust that were in a star's protoplanetary disk during the formation of its planets, and inform our understanding on how chemical compositions and abundances vary with distance from the central star. Their orbital migration distributes volatiles(2), organic material and prebiotic chemicals around their host system(3). In our Solar System, hundreds of comets have been observed remotely, and a few have been studied up close by space missions(4). However, knowledge of extrasolar comets has been limited to what could be gleaned from distant, unresolved observations of cometary regions around other stars, with only one detection of carbon monoxide(5). Here we report that the coma of 2I/Borisov contains substantially more CO than H2O gas, with abundances of at least 173%, more than three times higher than previously measured for any comet in the inner (<2.5 au) Solar System(4). Our ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope observations of 2I/Borisov provide the first glimpse into the ice content and chemical composition of the protoplanetary disk of another star that is substantially different from our own. Hubble Space Telescope data show that interstellar comet 2I/Borisov has an unusually high CO/H2O ratio-higher than any other comet that has been seen in the inner regions of our Solar System. This allows us to constrain the nature and location of the circumstellar region from which 2I/Borisov originated.

Progress Report on the Large-Scale Polarization Explorer	JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						Cosmic microwave background; B-modes; Transition edge sensors; Multi-moded optics		The large-scale polarization explorer (LSPE) is a cosmology program for the measurement of large-scale curl-like features (B-modes) in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. Its goal is to constrain the background of inflationary gravity waves traveling through the universe at the time of matter-radiation decoupling. The two instruments of LSPE are meant to synergically operate by covering a large portion of the northern microwave sky. LSPE/STRIP is a coherent array of receivers planned to be operated from the Teide Observatory in Tenerife, for the control and characterization of the low-frequency polarized signals of galactic origin; LSPE/SWIPE is a balloon-borne bolometric polarimeter based on 330 large throughput multi-moded detectors, designed to measure the CMB polarization at 150 GHz and to monitor the polarized emission by galactic dust above 200 GHz. The combined performance and the expected level of systematics mitigation will allow LSPE to constrain primordial B-modes down to a tensor/scalar ratio of 10(-2). We here report the status of the STRIP pre-commissioning phase and the progress in the characterization of the key subsystems of the SWIPE payload (namely the cryogenic polarization modulation unit and the multi-moded TES pixels) prior to receiver integration.

Grounding Line Retreat of Denman Glacier, East Antarctica, Measured With COSMO-SkyMed Radar Interferometry Data	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Antarctica; grounding line; radar interferometry; remote sensing; glaciology	PINE ISLAND GLACIER; ICE SHELVES; MASS-BALANCE; BASAL CONDITIONS; WEST ANTARCTICA; MELT RATES; REPRESENTATION; ACCELERATION; SURFACE; MODEL	Denman Glacier, East Antarctica, holds an ice volume equivalent to a 1.5 m rise in global sea level. Using satellite radar interferometry from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we detect a 5.4 0.3 km grounding line retreat between 1996 and 2017-2018. A novel reconstruction of the glacier bed topography indicates that the retreat proceeds on the western flank along a previously unknown 5 km wide, 1,800 m deep trough, deepening to 3,400 m below sea level. On the eastern flank, the grounding line is stabilized by a 10 km wide ridge. At tidal frequencies, the grounding line extends over a several kilometer-wide grounding zone, enabling warm ocean water to melt ice at critical locations for glacier stability. If warm, modified Circumpolar Deep Water reaches the sub-ice-shelf cavity and continues to melt ice at a rate exceeding balance conditions, the potential exists for Denman Glacier to retreat irreversibly into the deepest, marine-based basin in Antarctica. Plain Language Summary Using satellite radar data from the Italian COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we document the grounding line retreat of Denman Glacier, a major glacier in East Antarctica that holds an ice volume equivalent to a 1.5 m global sea level rise. The grounding line is retreating asymmetrically. On the eastern flank, the glacier is protected by a subglacial ridge. On the western flank, we find a deep and steep trough with a bed slope that makes the glacier conducive to rapid retreat. If warm water continues to induce high rates of ice melt near the glacier grounding zone, the potential exists for Denman Glacier to undergo a rapid and irreversible retreat, with major consequences for sea level rise.

Synthesis of Methane Observations Across Scales: Strategies for Deploying a Multitiered Observing Network	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						methane; inverse; emissions; landfill; urban; multitier	LOS-ANGELES; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; POINT SOURCES; 4 CORNERS; EMISSIONS; TROPOMI; CH4; MISSION	Regional methane emissions monitoring is rapidly expanding with increased coverage of surface, airborne, and satellite instruments. We pilot a multitiered observing system in the Los Angeles Basin. We combine surface methane measurements from the Los Angeles Megacities Carbon Project, mountaintop retrievals from the CLARS-FTS instrument, and space-based X-CH4 retrievals from the TROPOMI instrument into a single monitoring framework. We simulate these observations using a high-resolution tracer transport model. Using inverse methods, we compare the sensitivity of each observing system component to various emissions sources. Combining multiple observing system into one framework allows for increased spatial and temporal sensitivity to methane emissions. We find a close correspondence between these inverse flux trends and independent airborne AVIRIS-NG methane plume trends over a large landfill in the Los Angeles Basin. These results show that multitiered observing systems can reveal insights about sub-basin scale methane emissions, which can be used to drive decision support. Plain Language Summary Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas. In order to effectively reduce its atmospheric concentrations, we need advanced methane observing strategies to pinpoint large emissions on small spatial scales. In this study, we combine surface, mountaintop, and satellite observations of methane over Los Angeles (called a multitiered observing system) and use these data to infer information about urban methane emissions. We assess how much information each component of the observing system provides to this analytics system. We validate our findings with independent airborne methane fluxes derived from the AVIRIS-NG airborne instrument over a large landfill. Both systems detected large emission reductions that resulted from improved management practices. A multitiered observing and analytics system can potentially provide sub-basin scale decision support for methane mitigation.

J	Delaney, I; Adhikari, S				Delaney, Ian; Adhikari, Surendra			Increased Subglacial Sediment Discharge in a Warming Climate: Consideration of Ice Dynamics, Glacial Erosion, and Fluvial Sediment Transport	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						subglacial erosion; alpine sediment dynamics; sediment transport; glacier modeling; climate change; glacier sediment	DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; NUMERICAL-MODEL; BASAL SEDIMENT; FLOW; HYDROLOGY; DRAINAGE; INSIGHTS; DRIVEN; EXPORT	We evaluate changes to subglacial sediment discharge during glacier retreat by considering ice dynamics, bedrock erosion, and sediment transport processes. Coupling these components together within a single framework, we simulate sediment discharge from synthetic alpine glaciers experiencing accelerated glacier melt for 100 years. We find that sediment discharge increases by about 8 times the steady glacier values by the end of the simulation. The enhanced sediment discharge persists through peak water discharge and despite annual bedrock erosion volumes decreasing by approximately 30% from the initial value. The greater sediment discharge results from increased melt at the glaciers' higher region, where transport was limited prior to glacier retreat. These findings suggest that large increases in sediment discharge may occur as glaciers retreat. The magnitude of the sediment discharge increase primarily depends on the quantity of sediment stored subglacially. Plain Language Summary Changes to sediment discharge from glaciers can dramatically impact downstream communities and ecosystems. We account for two primary processes that largely control to sediment discharge from glaciers: (1) bedrock erosion, which creates sediment below the glacier and (2) the ability of meltwater below the glacier to carry this sediment. To understand the potential changes in sediment discharge as glaciers retreat, we link numerical models of both processes and run them in a scenario that complies with ongoing climate warming. In the scenario, we find that sediment discharge increases dramatically, despite smaller quantities of sediment being produced by bedrock erosion. This is because more meltwater higher on the glaciers increases sediment transport in these upper regions. Results here suggest that future subglacial sediment discharge depends on the amount of sediment that already exists below glaciers. Large increases in subglacial sediment discharge are possible.

Here, we examine how well solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can inform crop productivity across the United States. Based on tower-level observations and process-based modeling, we find highly linear gross primary production (GPP):SIF relationships for C4 crops, while C3 crops show some saturation of GPP at high light when SIF continues to increase. C4 crops yield higher GPP:SIF ratios (30-50%) primarily because SIF is most sensitive to the light reactions (does not account for photorespiration). Scaling to the satellite, we compare SIF from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) against tower-derived GPP and county-level crop statistics. Temporally, TROPOMI SIF strongly agrees with GPP observations upscaled across a corn and soybean dominated cropland (R-2 = 0.89). Spatially, county-level TROPOMI SIF correlates with crop productivity (R-2 = 0.72; 0.86 when accounting for planted area and C3/C4 contributions), highlighting the potential of SIF for reliable crop monitoring. Plain Language Summary Crop monitoring is essential for ensuring food security, but reliable, instantaneous production estimates at the global scale are lacking. The monitoring of crop production in a changing climate is of paramount importance to sustainable food security. Accurate estimates of crop production are dependent on adequately quantifying crop photosynthesis. Our paper demonstrates that solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an emission of red to far-red light from chlorophyll is highly correlated with crop photosynthesis. We show that a new high spatial resolution satellite SIF data set is highly correlated with crop productivity in the United States, which is benchmarked by the United States Department of Agriculture county-level crop statistics. These results will improve the understanding of crop production and carbon flux over agricultural lands, as well as provide an accurate, large-scale, and timely monitoring method for global crop production estimates.

Detection of Negative Pickup Ions at Saturn's Moon Dione	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						exosphere; Dione; icy satellites; pickup ions; magnetosphere; moon-magnetosphere interactions	LUNAR PLASMA WAKE; LOWER IONOSPHERE; CASSINI CAPS; CALIBRATION; COLLISIONS; TETHYS; FIELDS; RHEA; MARS	We investigate a possible negative ion feature observed by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) during a flyby of Saturn's moon Dione that occurred on 7 April 2010. By examining possible particle trajectories, we find that the observed particles are consistent with negative pickup ions originating near the moon's surface. We find that the mass of the negative pickup ions is in the range of 15-25 u and tentatively identify this species as O-, likely resulting from ionization and subsequent pickup from Dione's O-2-CO2 exosphere. Our estimates show that the negative ion density is similar to 3 x 10(-3) cm(-3).

Phase Behavior of Clathrate Hydrates in the Ternary H2O-NH3-Cyclopentane System	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						clathrate hydrates; cyclopentane; ammonia; Raman; diffraction; calorimetry	CARBON-DIOXIDE; TITANS ATMOSPHERE; HIGH-PRESSURE; SOLID-PHASES; AMMONIA; METHANE; CYCLOPENTANE; ORIGIN; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; CO2	Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, is the only icy moon with a dense atmosphere that is composed mainly of N-2. Methane, the second most abundant constituent, would be depleted in only 30-100 million years by active photochemistry, suggesting replenishment from Titan's interior. Under Titan's near-surface conditions, clathrate hydrates are the stable form of methane and ice together, making them a likely methane reservoir. Cassini-Huygens observations suggest that ammonia is the main source of Titan's atmospheric N-2. Ammonia is known to decrease the melting point of water ice and some clathrate hydrates, such as those of tetrahydrofuran. The present study investigates the interaction of ammonia with cyclopentane clathrate hydrates (atmospheric analogue for methane clathrates) via a detailed examination of phase behavior using micro-Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction. The results show that ammonia has the same effect on the stability of the cyclopentane clathrate as on tetrahydrofuran clathrate and ice by lowering the dissociation temperature by several tens of degrees and inducing incongruent melting. Ammonia does not interact directly with cyclopentane and does not appear to be incorporated into the cyclopentane clathrate structure, whether in the lattice or within the cages. A similar effect could be expected for methane clathrates. The presence of ammonia in Titan's crust would thus destabilize methane clathrates, resulting in outgassing and replenishment of atmospheric methane.

Investigations on evaporitic rock were carried out as part of the MIne Analog Research (MINAR) project at Boulby Mine, the United Kingdom. The edges of the polygons have a higher clay content and contain higher abundances of minerals such as quartz and microcline, and clays such as illite and chlorite, compared with the interior of polygons, suggesting that the edges were preferred locations for the accumulation of weathering products during their formation. The mineral content and its strontium isotope ratio suggest that the material is from continental weathering at the borders of the Permian Zechstein Sea. The edges of the polygons contain material with mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of -20.8 and 5.3, respectively. Lipids, including alkanes and hopanes, were extracted from the interior and edges of the polygons, which are inferred to represent organic material entrained in the evaporites when they were formed. The presence of long-chain alkanes (C-20-C-35) that lack a carbon preference, low abundances of C-23-C-29 hopanes, and lack of marine, evaporitic, or thermal maturity indicators show that lipid biomarkers were, at least in part, potentially derived from a continental source and have not undergone significant thermal maturation since deposition. Lipid extractions using weak acids revealed significantly more lipids than those without acid, potentially indicating that encapsulation was not the only type of preservation mechanism occurring in Boulby salts. These data demonstrate the potential for ancient evaporites and their polygons to preserve information on local geological conditions, ancient habitability, and evidence of life. The data show that analogous martian evaporitic deposits are good targets for future life detection missions and the investigation of ancient martian habitability.

Estimation of spatially continuous daytime particulate matter concentrations under all sky conditions through the synergistic use of satellite-based AOD and numerical models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Particulate matter; AOD; Satellite; Machine learning; Random Forest	AEROSOL OPTICAL DEPTH; LEVEL PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS; BEIJING-TIANJIN-HEBEI; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; KM RESOLUTION; AIR-QUALITY; MODIS AOD; PRODUCTS; EXPOSURE; AERONET	Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are one of main predictors to estimate ground-level particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations. Since AOD products, however, are only provided under high-quality conditions, missing values usually exist in areas such as clouds, cloud shadows, and bright surfaces. In this study, spatially continuous AOD and subsequent PM10 to and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated over East Asia using satellite-and model-based data and auxiliary data in a Random Forest (RF) approach. Data collected from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOO; 8 times per day) in 2016 were used to develop AOD and PM models. Three schemes (i.e. G1, A1, and A2) were proposed for AOD modeling according to target AOD data (COG AOD and AERONET AOD) and the existence of satellite-derived AOD. The A2 scheme showed the best peifomiance (validation R-2 of 0.74 and prediction R-2 of 0.73 when GOCI AOD did not exist) and the resultant AOD was used to estimate spatially continuous PM concentrations. The PM models with location information produced successful estimation results with R-2 of 0.88 and 0.90, and iRMSE of 26.9 and 272% for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The spatial distribution maps of PM well captured the seasonal and spatial characteristics of PM reported in the literature, which implies the proposed approaches can be adopted for an operational estimation of spatially continuous AOD and PMs under all sky conditions.

However, evaluating regional changes in the terrestrial carbon balance is challenging due to the lack of surface flux measurements. This study reveals that the terrestrial carbon uptake over the Republic of Korea has been enhanced from 1999 to 2017 by analyzing long-term atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements at the Anmyeondo Station (36.53 degrees N, 126.32 degrees E) located in the western coast. The influence of terrestrial carbon flux on atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Delta CO2) is estimated from the difference of CO2 concentrations that were influenced by the land sector (through easterly winds) and the Yellow Sea sector (through westerly winds). We find a significant trend in Delta CO2 of -4.75 ppm per decade (p < .05) during the vegetation growing season (May through October), suggesting that the regional terrestrial carbon uptake has increased relative to the surrounding ocean areas. Combined analysis with satellite measured normalized difference vegetation index and gross primary production shows that the enhanced carbon uptake is associated with significant nationwide increases in vegetation and its production. Process-based terrestrial model and inverse model simulations estimate that regional terrestrial carbon uptake increases by up to 18.9 and 8.0 Tg C for the study period, accounting for 13.4% and 5.7% of the average annual domestic carbon emissions, respectively. Atmospheric chemical transport model simulations indicate that the enhanced terrestrial carbon sink is the primary reason for the observed Delta CO2 trend rather than anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric circulation changes. Our results highlight the fact that atmospheric CO2 measurements could open up the possibility of detecting regional changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle even where anthropogenic emissions are not negligible.

Novel approach to distinguish between vacuum UV-induced ice photodesorption and photoconversion: Investigation of CH4, CH3OH, and CH3CN	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						astrochemistry; ISM: molecules; ISM: clouds; ultraviolet: ISM; methods: laboratory: solid state; molecular processes	WATER ICE; CO; DESORPTION; METHANOL; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; ABSORPTION; MORPHOLOGY; MOLECULES; RELEVANT; SPECTRA	Context. In cold regions of the interstellar medium with intense ultraviolet radiation fields, photodesorption has been suggested as a nonthermal desorption mechanism promoting the transition of molecules from the solid state to the gas phase. Laboratory experiments measuring photodesorption rates are crucial in attempting to explain high molecular gas phase abundances of species that are expected to form in the solid state, such as methane, methanol, and acetonitrile, and to aid astrochemical modeling. Due to the convoluted competition between photodesorption and photoconversion, it is far from trivial to derive accurate photodesorption rates.Aims. The aim of this study is to apply a new methodology to discriminate between the two processes. The method has been validated using the well-studied case of CO and extended to CH4, CH3OH, and CH3CN.Methods. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV; photon energy of 7-10.2 eV) irradiated ices at 20 K are studied, first as a pure CH4, CH3OH, or CH3CN ice and subsequently with an Ar coating on top. The latter is transparent to the VUV photons (wavelength below 200 nm), but it quenches the photodesorption process. Comparing the laser desorption post ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the ices with and without the Ar coating provides information on the different interactions of the VUV photons with the ice.Results. The newly developed experimental technique allowed for a derivation of photodesorption rates for ices at 20 K of: CO (3.1 +/- 0.3)x10(-3) mol. photon(-1), CH4 (3.1 +/- 0.5)x10(-2) mol. photon(-1), and upper limits for CH3OH (< 6x10(-5) mol. photon(-1)) and CH3CN (< 7.4x10(-4) mol. photon(-1)); in the latter case, no literature values have been reported yet. The newly introduced approach provides more insight into the photodesorption process, in particular, for commonly observed complex organic molecules (COMs). Photoconversion cross sections are presented in the 7-10.2 eV range. The possible role of photodesorption and photoconversion in the formation of interstellar COMs is discussed.

Single-footprint AIRS radiances are processed with an optimal estimation algorithm that provides vertical profiles of the HDO/H2O ratio, characterized uncertainties and instrument operators (i.e., averaging kernel matrix). These retrievals are compared to vertical profiles of the HDO/H2O ratio from the Oregon State University Water Isotope Spectrometer for Precipitation and Entrainment Research (WISPER) on the ORACLES NASA P-3B Orion aircraft. Measurements were taken over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean from 31 August to 25 September 2016. HDO/H2O is commonly reported in delta D notation, which is the fractional deviation of the HDO/H2O ratio from the standard reference ratio. For collocated measurements, the satellite instrument operator (averaging kernels and a priori constraint) is applied to the aircraft profile measurements. We find that AIRS delta D bias relative to the aircraft is well within the estimated measurement uncertainty. In the lower troposphere, 1000 to 800 hPa, AIRS delta D bias is -6.6% and the root-mean-square (rms) deviation is 20.9 parts per thousand, consistent with the calculated uncertainty of 19.1 parts per thousand. In the mid-troposphere, 800 to 500 hPa, AIRS delta D bias is -6.8 parts per thousand and rms 44.9 parts per thousand, comparable to the calculated uncertainty of 25.8 parts per thousand.

Mid-infrared dual-comb spectroscopy with room-temperature bi-functional interband cascade lasers and detectors	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY	Interband cascade (IC) laser structures offer attractive potential for operation at room temperature as both broadband coherent sources of mid-infrared light and fast photodetectors. This makes the realization of extremely compact spectrometers on a monolithic platform possible, and even dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) configurations. IC comb devices are perfect candidates for this configuration, since they develop near-THz-wide optical frequency comb spectra from a millimeter-sized cavity, using a multi-stage structure that can also function as a very fast photodetector. In this work, we leverage IC photodetectors with a gigahertz bandwidth to demonstrate a self-contained, free-running, room-temperature DCS system in the mid-infrared. The DCS system used detection by the same bi-functional IC device structure to measure 1,1-difluoroethane over similar to 600GHz of optical coverage around 3.6 mu m. These results show that the IC platform is suitable for full integration as a broadband, high-resolution on-chip spectrometer in a future chemical sensing system.	[Sterczewski, L.

A pole-to-pole pressure-temperature map of Saturn's thermosphere from Cassini Grand Finale data	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article; Early Access							UPPER-ATMOSPHERE; BAND SYSTEM; IONOSPHERE; MODEL; TABLE; FIELD	The complete latitudinal coverage of Saturn's thermospheric temperatures from Cassini Grand Finale data shows a more uniform spatial behaviour than model predictions, indicating an efficient redistribution of auroral energy from the poles towards the equator that could contribute to solving the giant planet's energy crisis puzzle. Temperatures of the outer planet thermospheres exceed those predicted by solar heating alone by several hundred degrees. Enough energy is deposited at auroral regions to heat the entire thermosphere, but models predict that equatorward distribution is inhibited by strong Coriolis forces and ion drag(1,2). A better understanding of auroral energy deposition and circulation are critical to solving this so-called energy crisis. Stellar occultations observed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument during the Cassini Grand Finale were designed to map the thermosphere from pole to pole. We analyse these observations, together with earlier observations from 2016 and 2017, to create a two-dimensional map of densities and temperatures in Saturn's thermosphere as a function of latitude and depth. The observed temperatures at auroral latitudes are cooler and peak at higher altitudes and lower latitudes than predicted by models, leading to a shallower meridional pressure gradient. Under modified geostrophy(3), we infer slower westward zonal winds that extend to lower latitudes than predicted, supporting equatorward flow from approximately 70 degrees to 30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres. We also show evidence of atmospheric waves in the data that can contribute to equatorward redistribution of energy through zonal drag.

Here we consider insights provided by both linear and non-linear instability theories into the conditions under which such instabilities may occur, with reference to forced and dissipative flows obtainable in the laboratory, in simplified numerical atmospheric circulation models and in the planets of our solar system. The equilibration of such instabilities is also of great importance in understanding the structure and energetics of the observable circulation of atmospheres and oceans. Various ideas have been proposed concerning the ways in which baroclinic and barotropic instabilities grow to a large amplitude and saturate whilst also modifying their background flow and environment. This remains an area that continues to challenge theoreticians and observers, though some progress has been made. The notion that such instabilities may act under some conditions to adjust the background flow towards a critical state is explored here in the context of both laboratory systems and planetary atmospheres. Evidence for such adjustment processes is found relating to baroclinic instabilities under a range of conditions where the efficiency of eddy and zonal-mean heat transport may mutually compensate in maintaining a nearly invariant thermal structure in the zonal mean. In other systems, barotropic instabilities may efficiently mix potential vorticity to result in a flow configuration that is found to approach a marginally unstable state with respect to Arnol'd's second stability theorem. We discuss the implications of these findings and identify some outstanding open questions.

We compare our results with those of a full Monte Carlo simulation based on the ZHAireS code. This approach is able to reproduce the vector potential and hence electric field at any experimentally relevant observer position in the time domain. This work extends published results only valid for electron-induced showers. We establish the validity of the semianalytical calculation of the radio signal produced by all types of neutrino-induced showers in ice. The method is computationally efficient and only requires as inputs the longitudinal charge excess profile of the showers and a parametrization of the vector potential in the far-field region of the shower at the Cherenkov angle that we also provide. Our methodology avoids tracking the contributions to the electric field from millions of particles every time the radio pulse has to be calculated at a given observer position. These results can be readily used in the interpretation of the data taken by experiments, and in the planning and design of future initiatives based on the radio technique in ice.

Traditional studies focus on meteorological forecasts and fire danger index models (e.g., National Fire Danger Rating System-NFDRS) for predicting fire danger. Meteorological forecasts, however, lose accuracy beyond 10 days; as such, there is no quantifiable method for predicting fire danger beyond 10 days. While some recent studies have statistically related hydrologic parameters and past wildfire area burned or occurrence to fire, no study has used these parameters to develop a monthly spatially distributed predictive model in the contiguous United States. Thus, the objective of this study is to introduce Fire Danger from Earth Observations (FDEO), which uses satellite data over the contiguous United States (CONUS) to enable two-month lead time prediction of wildfire danger, a sufficient lead time for planning purposes and relocating resources. In this study, we use satellite observations of land cover type, vapor pressure deficit, surface soil moisture, and the enhanced vegetation index, together with the United States Forest Service (USFS) verified and validated fire database (FPA) to develop spatially gridded probabilistic predictions of fire danger, defined as expected area burned as a deviation from "normal". The results show that the model predicts spatial patterns of fire danger with 52% overall accuracy over the 2004-2013 record, and up to 75% overall accuracy during the fire season. Overall accuracy is defined as number of pixels with correctly predicted fire probability classes divided by the total number of the studied pixels. This overall accuracy is the first quantified result of two-month lead prediction of fire danger and demonstrates the potential utility of using diverse observational data sets for use in operational fire management resource allocation in the CONUS.

SI-Traceability and Measurement Uncertainty of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder Version 5 Level 1B Radiances	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						infrared; hyperspectral; satellite; radiometric; calibration; sounder; polarization; accuracy; uncertainty	RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; PERFORMANCE	The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the EOS Aqua Spacecraft was launched on 4 May 2002. The AIRS is designed to measure atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles and has demonstrated exceptional radiometric and spectral accuracy and stability in orbit. The International System of Units (SI)-traceability of the derived radiances is achieved by transferring the calibration from the Large Area Blackbody (LABB) with SI traceable temperature sensors, to the On-Board Calibrator (OBC) blackbody during preflight testing. The AIRS views the OBC blackbody and four full aperture space views every scan. A recent analysis of pre-flight and on-board data has improved our understanding of the measurement uncertainty of the Version 5 AIRS L1B radiance product. For temperatures greater than 260 K, the measurement uncertainty is better than 250 mK 1-sigma for most channels. SI-traceability and quantification of the radiometric measurement uncertainty is critical to reducing biases in reanalysis products and radiative transfer models (RTMs) that use AIRS data, as well as establishing the suitability of AIRS as a benchmark for radiances established in the early 2000s.

OCO-2 uses onboard lamps with a reflective diffuser, solar observations through a transmissive diffuser, lunar measurements, and surface targets for radiometric calibration and validation. Separating calibrator aging from instrument degradation poses a challenge to OCO-2. Here we present a methodology for trending the OCO-2 Build 8R radiometric calibration using OCO-2 nadir observations over eight desert sites and nearly simultaneous observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with sensor viewing zenith angles of 15 +/- 0.5 degrees. For the O-2 A-band, this methodology is able to quantify a drift of -0.8 +/- 0.1% per year and capture a small error in correcting the aging of the solar calibrator. For the other two OCO-2 bands, no measurable changes were seen, indicating less than 0.1% and less than 0.3% per year drift in the radiometric calibration of Band 2 and Band 3, respectively.

J	Chiow, SW; Yu, N				Chiow, Sheng-wey; Yu, Nan			Constraining symmetron dark energy using atom interferometry	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The symmetron field is one of the promising candidates of dark energy scalar fields. In all viable candidate field theories, a screening mechanism is implemented to be consistent with existing tests of general relativity. The screening effect in the symmetron theory manifests its influence only to the thin outer layer of a bulk object, where inside a dense material the symmetry of the field is restored and no force exists. For pointlike particles such as atoms, the depth of screening is larger than the size of the particle, such that the screening mechanism is ineffective and the symmetron force is fully expressed on the atomic test particles. Extra force measurements using atom interferometry are thus much more sensitive than bulk mass based measurements, and indeed have placed the most stringent constraints on the parameters characterizing symmetron field in certain region. There is however no clear direct connection between the laboratory measurements and astrophysical observations, where the constraints are far separated by 10 orders of magnitude in the parameter space. In this paper, we present a closed-form expression for the symmetron acceleration of realistic atomic experiments. The expression is validated through numerical simulations for a terrestrial fifth-force experiment using atom interferometry. As a result, we show the connection of the atomic measurement constraints to the astrophysical ones. We also estimate the attainable symmetron constraints from a previously proposed experiment in space intended for a test of chameleon theory. The atomic constraints on the symmetron theory will be further improved by orders of magnitude.

An Exploration of Mission Concepts That Could Utilize Small RPS	NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Power; radioisotope power systems; small RPS; mission concepts; small spacecraft		The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Mission Analysis Team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) requested a JPL Innovation Foundry Architecture Team (A-Team) study to assess mission pull for small RPS [1 to 40 W(electric)] and define the focus of future power system developments required to enable small RPS missions. The A-Team is JPL's concurrent engineering design team for science definition and early mission concept development, targeting concept maturation levels of 1, 2, and 3. The requested small RPS study aimed to identify the architecture space of potential small RPS missions and suggest power levels that could enable or enhance potential future small spacecraft missions. This paper describes the collaborative engineering processes that the A-Team and Mission Analysis Team used to reach results quickly and presents the findings on power requirements for small RPS mission concepts.

This translates to failures in visual odometry and visual navigation. Glaciologists use near-infrared imagery to reveal the underlying heterogeneous spatial structure of snow and ice, and we theorize that this hidden near-infrared structure could produce more and higher quality features than available in visible light. We took a custom camera rig to Igloo Cave at Mt. St. Helens to test our theory. The camera rig contains two identical machine vision cameras, one which was outfitted with multiple filters to see only near-infrared light. We extracted features from short video clips taken inside Igloo Cave at Mt. St. Helens, using three popular feature extractors (FAST, SIFT, and SURF). We quantified the number of features and their quality for visual navigation by comparing the resulting orientation estimates to ground truth. Our main contribution is the use of NIR longpass filters to improve the quantity and quality of visual features in icy terrain, irrespective of the feature extractor used.

For this purpose, sequences of reference-level air temperature and specific humidity were assimilated into an atmospheric boundary layer model (ABL) within a variational data assimilation (VDA) framework to estimate H and LE. The VDA approach was tested at six sites (namely, Arou, Audubon, Bondville, Brookings, Desert, and Willow Creek) with contrasting climatic and vegetative conditions. The unknowns of the VDA system were the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (C-HN) and evaporative fraction (EF). EF estimates were found to agree well with observations in terms of magnitude and day-to-day fluctuations in wet/densely vegetated sites but degraded in dry/sparsely vegetated sites. Similarly, in wet/densely vegetated sites, the variations in the C-HN estimates were found to be consistent with those of the leaf area index (LAI) while this consistency deteriorated in dry/sparely vegetated sites. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of daily H and LE estimates at the Arou site (wet) were 25.43 (Wm(-2)) and 55.81 (Wm(-2)), which are respectively 57.6% and 45.4% smaller than those of 60.00 (Wm(-2)) and 102.21 (Wm(-2)) at the Desert site (dry). Overall, the results show that the VDA system performs well at wet/densely vegetated sites (e.g., Arou and Willow Creek), but its performance degrades at dry/slightly vegetated sites (e.g., Desert and Audubon). These outcomes show that the sequences of reference-level air temperature and specific humidity have more information on the partitioning of available energy between the sensible and latent heat fluxes in wet/densely vegetated sites than dry/slightly vegetated sites.

Investigating the Atmospheric Sources and Sinks of Perfluorooctanoic Acid Using a Global Chemistry Transport Model	ATMOSPHERE			English	Article						Criegee intermediates; perfluorooctanoic acid; global budget; atmospheric lifetime	INTERMEDIATES CRI MECHANISM; POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES; PERFLUORINATED ACIDS; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; PERFLUOROALKYL; PFOA; KINETICS; IMPACTS; BIOTA	Perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA, is one of the many concerning pollutants in our atmosphere; it is highly resistant to environmental degradation processes, which enables it to accumulate biologically. With direct routes of this chemical to the environment decreasing, as a consequence of the industrial phase out of PFOA, it has become more important to accurately model the effects of indirect production routes, such as environmental degradation of precursors; e.g., fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs). The study reported here investigates the chemistry, physical loss and transport of PFOA and its precursors, FTOHs, throughout the troposphere using a 3D global chemical transport model, STOCHEM-CRI. Moreover, this investigation includes an important loss process of PFOA in the atmosphere via the addition of the stabilised Criegee intermediates, hereby referred to as the "Criegee Field." Whilst reaction with Criegee intermediates is a significant atmospheric loss process of PFOA, it does not result in its permanent removal from the atmosphere. The atmospheric fate of the resultant hydroperoxide product from the reaction of PFOA and Criegee intermediates resulted in a approximate to 0.04 Gg year(-1) increase in the production flux of PFOA. Furthermore, the physical loss of the hydroperoxide product from the atmosphere (i.e., deposition), whilst decreasing the atmospheric concentration, is also likely to result in the reformation of PFOA in environmental aqueous phases, such as clouds, precipitation, oceans and lakes. As such, removal facilitated by the "Criegee Field" is likely to simply result in the acceleration of PFOA transfer to the surface (with an expected decrease in PFOA atmospheric lifetime of approximate to 10 h, on average from ca. 80 h without Criegee loss to 70 h with Criegee loss).

We have conducted detailed analysis of the LAT data for this source and multiwavelength studies of the source field. Its gamma-ray emission can be described with a power law (Gamma = 2.0 +/- 0.2) with an exponential cut-off (E-c = 2.9 +/- 1.6 GeV), while the flux shows significant long-term variations. From analysis of archival Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-Ray Telescope data, we find only one X-ray source in the LAT's 2 sigma error region. Within a 3.7 arcsec radius error circle of the X-ray source, there is only one optical object down to r' similar to 23 mag. Time-resolved photometry of the optical object indicates a likely 2.5 h periodic modulation, while its spectrum shows double-peaked hydrogen and helium emission lines (similar to those seen in accretion discs in low-mass X-ray binaries). Combining these results, we conclude that we have discovered a compact X-ray emitting binary in likely association with 4FGL J0935.3+0901, i.e. a millisecond pulsar (MSP) binary. We discuss the implication of the optical spectral features: this binary could be a transitional MSP system at a subluminous disc state, although the other possibility, the binary in a rotation powered state showing the optical emission lines due to intrabinary interaction processes, cannot be excluded. Further observational studies will help to determine detailed properties of this candidate MSP binary and thus clarify its current state.

Model validation and forecasts for Stage IV surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: analytical; cosmology: theory; large-scale structure of Universe	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; DARK-MATTER; GRAVITY; SPACE; GROWTH	Accurate modelling of non-linear scales in galaxy clustering will be crucial for data analysis of Stage IV galaxy surveys. A selection of competing non-linear models must be made based on validation studies. We provide a comprehensive set of forecasts of two different models for the halo redshift space power spectrum, namely the commonly applied TNS model and an effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFTofLSS) inspired model. Using simulation data and a least-chi(2) analysis, we determine ranges of validity for the models. We then conduct an exploratory Fisher analysis using the full anisotropic power spectrum to investigate parameter degeneracies. We proceed to perform an MCMC analysis utilizing the monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole spectra, with a restricted range of scales for the latter in order to avoid biasing our growth rate, f, constraint. We find that the TNS model with a Lorentzian damping and standard Eulerian perturbative modelling outperforms other variants of the TNS model. Our MCMC analysis finds that the EFTofLSS-based model may provide tighter marginalized constraints on f at z = 0.5 and z = 1 than the TNS model, despite having additional nuisance parameters. However this depends on the range of scales used as well as the fiducial values and priors on the EFT nuisance parameters. Finally, we extend previous work to provide a consistent comparison between the Fisher matrix and MCMC forecasts using the multipole expansion formalism, and find good agreement between them.

Hydrogen from steam methane reforming by catalytic nonthermal plasma using a dielectric barrier discharge reactor	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						catalytic nonthermal plasma; dielectric barrier discharge reactor; hydrogen; methane reforming		A scaled-up dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor has been developed and demonstrated for the production of hydrogen from steam methane reforming (SMR) by catalytic nonthermal plasma (CNTP) technology. Compared to SMR, CNTP offers conversion at ambient pressure (101.325 kPa), low temperature with better efficiency, making it suitable for distributed hydrogen production with small footprint. There have been several lab-scale DBD reactors reported in the literature. Dimension of the scaled-up DBD reactor is about six times the lab-scale version and can produce 0.9 kg H-2/day. The scale-up is, however, nonlinear; several technical innovations were required including spray nozzle for homogeneous introduction of steam, perforated tube central electrodes for generation of homogeneous plasma. Conversion efficiency of the scaled-up DBD reactor is 70-80% at 550 degrees C and 500 W. A continuous run of 8 hr was demonstrated with typical product gas composition of 69% H-2, 6% CO2, 15% CO, 10% CH4.

The primary science focus of ECOSTRESS is centered on evapotranspiration (ET), which is produced as Level-3 (L3) latent heat flux (LE) data products. These data are generated from the Level-2 land surface temperature and emissivity product (L2_LSTE), in conjunction with ancillary surface and atmospheric data. Here, we provide the first validation (Stage 1, preliminary) of the global ECOSTRESS clear-sky ET product (L3_ET_PT-JPL, Version 6.0) against LE measurements at 82 eddy covariance sites around the world. Overall, the ECOSTRESS ET product performs well against the site measurements (clear-sky instantaneous/time of overpass: r(2) = 0.88; overall bias = 8%; normalized root-mean-square error, RMSE = 6%). ET uncertainty was generally consistent across climate zones, biome types, and times of day (ECOSTRESS samples the diurnal cycle), though temperate sites are overrepresented. The 70-m-high spatial resolution of ECOSTRESS improved correlations by 85%, and RMSE by 62%, relative to 1-km pixels. This paper serves as a reference for the ECOSTRESS L3 ET accuracy and Stage 1 validation status for subsequent science that follows using these data. Key Points ECOSTRESS is a state-of-the-art combination of thermal bands, spatial and temporal resolutions, and measurement accuracy and precision Data from 82 eddy covariance sites were coalesced concurrently with the first year of ECOSTRESS for Stage 1 validation Clear-sky ET from ECOSTRESS compared well against a wide range of eddy covariance sites, vegetation classes, climate zones, and times of day	[Fisher, Joshua B.; Lee, Brian; Purdy, Adam J.; Halverson, Gregory H.; Dohlen, Matthew B.; Cawse-Nicholson, Kerry; Wang, Audrey; Hulley, Glynn; Hook, Simon] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Anderson, Ray G.] USDA, Riverside, CA USA; [Aragon, Bruno; McCabe, Matthew F.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Hydrol Agr & Land Observat Grp HALO, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Arain, M.

Three of the four efforts led to positive detections of the body, and all constrained the presence of rings and other debris, finding none. Twenty-five mobile stations were deployed for 2017 June 3 and augmented by fixed telescopes. There were no positive detections from this effort. The event on 2017 July 10 was observed by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy with one very short chord. Twenty-four deployed stations on 2017 July 17 resulted in five chords that clearly showed a complicated shape consistent with a contact binary with rough dimensions of 20 by 30 km for the overall outline. A visible albedo of 10% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were deployed for the fourth event on 2018 August 4 and resulted in two chords. The combination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a significant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380 +/- 0.0005 hr. The occultation data also provided high-precision astrometric constraints on the position of the object that were crucial for supporting the navigation for the New Horizons flyby. This work demonstrates an effective method for obtaining detailed size and shape information and probing for rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important source of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is particularly useful for small and distant bodies.

ASTER's visible-near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In August 2019, the ASTER Science Team released Version 3 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.8 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (similar to 30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. Custom software was developed to reduce or eliminate artifacts found in earlier GDEM versions, and to fill holes due to the masking. Each 1x1 degree GDEM tile was manually inspected to verify the completeness of the anomaly removal, which was generally excellent except across some large ice sheets. The GDEM covers all of the Earth's land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. This is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 100 million 1x1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.

Global Trends in Evapotranspiration Dominated by Increases across Large Cropland Regions	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						evapotranspiration; trend; croplands; Google Earth Engine; sustainability; MODIS evapotranspiration product; energy-limited and water-limited; solar-induced fluorescence (SIF); maize water consumption; water stress	AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER; INDEX; EVAPORATION; STRESS; MODIS	Irrigated croplands require large annual water inputs and are critical to global food production. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a main index of water use in croplands, and several remote-sensing products have been developed to quantify AET at the global scale. In this study, we estimate global trends in actual AET, potential ET (PET), and precipitation rate (PP) utilizing the MODIS Evapotranspiration product (2001-2018) within the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing environment. We then introduce a new index based on a combination of AET, PET, and PP estimates-the evapotranspiration warning index (ETWI)-which we use to evaluate the sustainability of observed AET trends. We show that while AET has not considerably changed across global natural lands, it has significantly increased across global croplands (+14% +/- 5%). The average ETWI for global croplands is -0.40 +/- 0.25, which is largely driven by an extreme trend in AET, exceeding both PET and PP trends. Furthermore, the trends in water and energy limited areas demonstrate, on a global scale, while AET and PET do not have significant trends in both water and energy limited areas, the increasing trend of PP in energy-limited areas is more than water-limited areas. Averaging cropland ETWI trends at the country level further revealed nonsustainable trends in cropland water consumptions in Thailand, Brazil, and China. These regions were also found to experiencing some of the largest increases in net primary production (NPP) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), suggesting that recent increases in food production may be dependent on unsustainable water inputs. Globally, irrigated maize was found to be associated with nonsustainable AET trends relative to other crop types. We present an online open access application designed to enable near real-time monitoring and improve the understanding of global water consumption and availability.

Energy Flux and Characteristic Energy of Electrons Over Jupiter's Main Auroral Emission	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; DETECTION EFFICIENCY; MAGNETIC-FIELD; JOVIAN AURORA; ACCELERATION; MAGNETOSPHERE; IONOSPHERE; PRECIPITATION; SPECTROSCOPY; COROTATION	Jupiter's ultraviolet (UV) aurorae, the most powerful and intense in the solar system, are caused by energetic electrons precipitating from the magnetosphere into the atmosphere where they excite the molecular hydrogen. Previous studies focused on case analyses and/or greater than 30-keV energy electrons. Here for the first time we provide a comprehensive evaluation of Jovian auroral electron characteristics over the entire relevant range of energies (similar to 100 eV to similar to 1 MeV). The focus is on the first eight perijoves providing a coarse but complete System III view of the northern and southern auroral regions with corresponding UV observations. The latest magnetic field model JRM09 with a current sheet model is used to map Juno's magnetic foot point onto the UV images and relate the electron measurements to the UV features. We find a recurring pattern where the 3- to 30-keV electron energy flux peaks in a region just equatorward of the main emission. The region corresponds to a minimum of the electron characteristic energy (<10 keV). Its polarward edge corresponds to the equatorward edge of the main oval, which is mapped at M shells of similar to 51. A refined current sheet model will likely bring this boundary closer to the expected 20-30 RJ. Outside that region, the >100-keV electrons contribute to most (>similar to 70-80%) of the total downward energy flux and the characteristic energy is usually around 100 keV or higher. We examine the UV brightness per incident energy flux as a function of characteristic energy and compare it to expectations from a model.	[Allegrini, F.; Gladstone, G.

Tulasi			Modeling of Ionospheric Responses to Atmospheric Acoustic and Gravity Waves Driven by the 2015 Nepal M(w)7.8 Gorkha Earthquake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							SPECTRAL-ELEMENT SIMULATIONS; 25 APRIL; INFRASOUND PROPAGATION; KATHMANDU BASIN; PACIFIC COAST; GPS DETECTION; DISTURBANCES; PERTURBATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; RESONANCE	Near- and far-field ionospheric responses to atmospheric acoustic and gravity waves (AGWs) generated by surface displacements during the 2015 Nepal M(w)7.8 Gorkha earthquake are simulated. Realistic surface displacements driven by the earthquake are calculated in three-dimensional forward seismic waves propagation simulation, based on kinematic slip model. They are used to excite AGWs at ground level in the direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional nonlinear compressible Navier-Stokes equations with neutral atmosphere model, which is coupled with a two-dimensional nonlinear multifluid electrodynamic ionospheric model. The importance of incorporating earthquake rupture kinematics for the simulation of realistic coseismic ionospheric disturbances (CIDs) is demonstrated and the possibility of describing faulting mechanisms and surface deformations based on ionospheric observations is discussed in details. Simulation results at the near-epicentral region are comparable with total electron content (TEC) observations in periods (similar to 3.3 and similar to 6-10 min for acoustic and gravity waves, respectively), propagation velocities (similar to 0.92 km/s for acoustic waves) and amplitudes (up to similar to 2 TECu). Simulated far-field CIDs correspond to long-period (similar to 4 mHz) Rayleigh waves (RWs), propagating with the same phase velocity of similar to 4 km/s. The characteristics of modeled RW-related ionospheric disturbances differ from previously-reported observations based on TEC data; possible reasons for these differences are discussed.	[Inchin, P.

J	Shen, ZK; Liu, Z				Shen, Zheng-Kang; Liu, Zhen			Integration of GPS and InSAR Data for Resolving 3-Dimensional Crustal Deformation	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						GPS; InSAR; deformation; integration; California; tectonics	SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; SURFACE MOTION MAPS; OPTIMIZATION; DERIVATION; FAULT	We develop an algorithm to integrate GPS and InSAR data for a 3-dimensional crustal deformation field at the Earth's surface. In the algorithm discrete GPS data points are interpolated to obtain a 3-dimensional continuous velocity field, which is then combined with the InSAR line-of-sight (LOS) velocity data pixel by pixel using the least-squares method. Advantages of our method over previous ones are that: 1) The GPS data points are optimally interpolated by balancing a trade-off between spatial resolution and solution stability. 2) A new algorithm is developed to estimate realistic uncertainties for the interpolated GPS velocities, to be used as weights for GPS data in GPS-InSAR combination. 3) Realistic uncertainties for the InSAR LOS rate data are estimated and used as weights for InSAR data in GPS-InSAR combination. 4) The ramps and/or offsets of the InSAR data are globally estimated for all the images to minimize data misfit, particularly at regions where the data overlaps. Application of this method to real data from southern California shows its capability of successfully restoring 3-dimensional continuous deformation field from spatially limited GPS and dimensionally limited InSAR data. The deformation field reveals water withdrawal induced subsidence and drought caused uplift at various regions in southern California.

Their role in Earth's energy balance and hydrologic cycle is heavily modulated by the vertical structure of the microphysical properties for various hydrometeors in these clouds and their dependence on the ambient environmental conditions. Accurate representations of the variability and covariability of such vertical structures are key to both the satellite remote sensing of cloud and precipitation and numerical modeling of weather and climate, which remain a challenge. This study presents a new method to combine vertically resolved observations from CloudSat radar reflectivity and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation cloud masks with probability distributions of cloud microphysical properties and the ambient atmospheric conditions from detailed in situ measurements on tropical anvils sampled during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration TC4 (Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling) mission. We focus on the microphysical properties of the vertical distribution of ice water content, particle size distributions, and effective sizes for different hydrometeors, including ice particles and supercooled liquid droplets. Results from this method are compared with those from in situ data alone and various CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation cloud retrievals. The sampling limitation of the field experiment and algorithm limitations in the current retrievals is highlighted, especially for the liquid cloud particles, while a generally good agreement with ice cloud microphysical properties is seen from different methods. While the method presented in this study is applied to tropical anvil clouds observed during TC4, it can be readily employed to study a broad range of ice clouds sampled by various field campaigns.

The US Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility recently initiated the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) ARM Symbiotic Simulation and Observation (LASSO) activity focused on shallow convection at ARM's Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory in Oklahoma, USA. LASSO is designed to overcome an oft shared difficulty of bridging the gap from point-based measurements to scales relevant for model parameterization development, and it provides an approach to add value to observations through modeling. LASSO is envisioned to be useful to modelers, theoreticians, and observationalists needing information relevant to cloud processes. LASSO does so by combining a suite of observations, LES inputs and outputs, diagnostics, and skill scores into data bundles that are freely available, and by simplifying user access to the data to speed scientific inquiry. The combination of relevant observations with observationally constrained LES output provides detail that gives context to the observations by showing physically consistent connections between processes based on the simulated state. A unique approach for LASSO is the generation of a library of cases for days with shallow convection combined with an ensemble of LES for each case. The library enables researchers to move beyond the single-case-study approach typical of LES research. The ensemble members are produced using a selection of different large-scale forcing sources and spatial scales. Since large-scale forcing is one of the most uncertain aspects of generating the LES, the ensemble informs users about potential uncertainty for each date and increases the probability of having an accurate forcing for each case.

More enigmatic, a dome was observed at the back of the vent and crater lake in November 2012. Its emplacement date could not be easily determined due to persistent steam from the evaporating crater lake and because of the very low levels of discrete volcanic earthquakes associated with its growth. During this period, seismicity also included persistent tremor with dominant frequencies in the 2-5 Hz range. Detailed assessment of the tremor reveals a very slow evolution of the spectral peaks from low to higher frequencies. These gliding spectral lines evolved over a three-month time period beginning in late September 2012 and persisting until early January 2013, when the tremor stabilised. As part of the dome emplacement episode, the crater lake progressively dried, leaving isolated pools which then promoted persistent mud/sulphur eruption activity starting in mid-January 2013. We interpret the emplacement of the dome as a non-explosive process where the hot, mostly degassed, magma intruded slowly through the hydrothermal system in late September 2012 and cooled in a relatively quiet state. The tremor evolution might reflect the slow contraction of subsurface resonant cavities, which increased the pitch of the peak resonant frequency through time. Alternatively, spectral evolution might reflect a 'comb function' due to clockwork beating of the slowly cooling dome, although direct evidence of clockwork beats is not seen in the waveform data. Finally, it might represent frothing of the hydrothermal system ahead of the slowly propagating magma.

Joint Radial Velocity and Direct Imaging Planet Yield Calculations. I. Self-consistent Planet Populations	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radial velocity; Exoplanet detection methods; Direct imaging; Astronomical simulations	MASS; SYSTEMS	Planet yield calculations may be used to inform the target selection strategy and science operations of space observatories. Forthcoming and proposed NASA missions, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission, and the Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor, are expected to be equipped with sensitive coronagraphs and/or starshades. We are developing a suite of numerical simulations to quantify the extent to which ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys could boost the detection efficiency of direct imaging missions. In this paper, we discuss the first step in the process of estimating planet yields: generating synthetic planetary systems consistent with observed occurrence rates from multiple detection methods. In an attempt to self-consistently populate stars with orbiting planets, it is found that naive extrapolation of occurrence rates (mass, semimajor axis) results in an unrealistically large number density of Neptune-mass planets beyond the ice line (a greater than or similar to 5 au), causing dynamic interactions that would destabilize orbits. We impose a stability criterion for multiplanet systems based on mutual Hill radii separation. Considering the influence of compact configurations containing Jovian-mass and Neptune-mass planets results in a marked suppression in the number of terrestrial planets that can exist at large radii. This result has a pronounced impact on planet yield calculations particularly in regions accessible to high-contrast imaging and microlensing. The dynamically compact configurations and occurrence rates that we develop may be incorporated as input into joint RV and direct imaging yield calculations to place meaningful limits on the number of detectable planets with future missions.

Modeling the Uncertainties of Solar System Ephemerides for Robust Gravitational-wave Searches with Pulsar-timing Arrays	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Gravitational waves; Astronomy data analysis; Ephemerides; Pulsar timing method; Millisecond pulsars		The regularity of pulsar emissions becomes apparent once we reference the pulses' times of arrivals to the inertial rest frame of the solar system. It follows that errors in the determination of Earth's position with respect to the solar system barycenter can appear as a time-correlated bias in pulsar-timing residual time series, affecting the searches for low-frequency gravitational waves performed with pulsar-timing arrays. Indeed, recent array data sets yield different gravitational-wave background upper limits and detection statistics when analyzed with different solar system ephemerides. Crucially, the ephemerides do not generally provide usable error representations. In this article, we describe the motivation, construction, and application of a physical model of solar system ephemeris uncertainties, which focuses on the degrees of freedom (Jupiter's orbital elements) most relevant to gravitational-wave searches with pulsar-timing arrays. This model, BayesEphem, was used to derive ephemeris-robust results in NANOGrav's 11 yr stochastic-background search, and it provides a foundation for future searches by NANOGrav and other consortia. The analysis and simulations reported here suggest that ephemeris modeling reduces the gravitational-wave sensitivity of the 11 yr data set and that this degeneracy will vanish with improved ephemerides and with pulsar-timing data sets that extend well beyond a single Jovian orbital period.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Solar flares; Coronagraphic imaging; Solar coronal mass ejections; Solar magnetic reconnection	FLUX-ROPE ACCELERATION; ENERGY-RELEASE; SOLAR; FLARE; MODEL; PHASE; BRIGHTNESS; GENESIS; RATES; FIELD	Theoretically, coronal mass ejection (CME) kinematics are related to magnetic reconnection processes in the solar corona. However, the current quantitative understanding of this relationship is based on the analysis of only a handful of events. Here we report a statistical study of 60 CME-flare events from 2010 August to 2013 December. We investigate kinematic properties of CMEs and magnetic reconnection in the low corona during the early phase of the eruptions, by combining limb observations from STEREO with simultaneous on-disk views from SDO. For a subset of 42 events with reconnection rate evaluated by the magnetic fluxes swept by the flare ribbons on the solar disk observed from SDO, we find a strong correlation between the peak CME acceleration and the peak reconnection rate. Also, the maximum velocities of relatively fast CMEs (greater than or similar to 600 km s(-1)) are positively correlated with the reconnection flux, but no such correlation is found for slow CMEs. A time-lagged correlation analysis suggests that the distribution of the time lag of CME acceleration relative to reconnection rate exhibits three peaks, approximately 10 minutes apart, and on average, acceleration-led events have smaller reconnection rates. We further compare the CME total mechanical energy with the estimated energy in the current sheet. The comparison suggests that, for small-flare events, reconnection in the current sheet alone is insufficient to fuel CMEs. Results from this study suggest that flare reconnection may dominate the acceleration of fast CMEs, but for events of slow CMEs and weak reconnection, other mechanisms may be more important.

Because they require installation by a ship and must be secured to the seafloor, moorings are expensive, logistically difficult to deploy and maintain, and are constrained to one location once installed. To circumvent these issues, previous studies have attempted to utilize autonomous underwater gliders as platforms for virtual moorings, but these attempts have yielded comparatively large station-keeping errors due to the difficulty of glider control in dynamic ocean currents. We implemented an adaptive planner using a vehicle motion model and a predictive ocean circulation model to improve station-keeping performance by incorporating anticipated currents into glider control. We demonstrate improved station-keeping performance using our planner in both simulation and in-field deployment results, and report smaller average station-keeping error than the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's M1 mooring. Finally, we utilize our simulation framework to conduct a feasibility study on using an array of autonomous gliders as virtual moorings to conduct critical calibration and validation (CalVal) for the upcoming National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Mission, instead of using permanent moorings. We show that this approach carries several advantages and has potential to meet the SWOT CalVal objectives.

Degradation of Homestead Hollow at the InSight Landing Site Based on the Distribution and Properties of Local Deposits	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; degradation; InSight; eolian; impact	MARS; EROSION; CRATER; SPIRIT; EJECTA	The InSight mission landed its scientific payload in Homestead hollow, a quasi-circular depression interpreted to be a highly degraded impact crater that is 27 m in diameter. The original pristine crater formed in a preexisting impact-generated regolith averaging similar to 3 m thick and the surrounding ejecta deposit, consisting of coarse and mostly fine fragments, was in disequilibrium with local geomorphic thresholds. As a result, early, relatively rapid degradation by mostly eolian, and lesser impact processes and mass-wasting, stripped the rim and mostly infilled the hollow where sediments were sequestered. Early, faster degradation during the first similar to 0.1 Ga was followed by much slower degradation over the bulk of the 0.4-0.7 Ga history of the crater. Pulses of much lesser degradation are attributed to impacts in and nearby the hollow, which emplaced some rocks as ejecta and provided small inventories of fine sediments for limited additional infilling. Even lesser sediments were derived from the very slow production of fines via weathering of resistant basaltic rocks. Nevertheless, indurated regolith caps the sediment fill within the hollow and creates a relatively stable present-day surface that further sequesters infilling sediments from remobilization. The degradation sequence at Homestead hollow is like that established at the Spirit rover landing site in Gusev crater and points to the importance of eolian, and lesser impact and mass-wasting processes, in degrading volcanic surfaces on Mars over the past similar to 1 Ga.

On the Spatial Distribution of Minor Species in Jupiter's Troposphere as Inferred From Juno JIRAM Data	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Jupiter; atmospheric composition; minor gases	RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; DEEP ATMOSPHERE; SATURN; WATER; ALGORITHM; PHOSPHINE; ABUNDANCE	The spatial distribution of water, ammonia, phosphine, germane, and arsine in the Jupiter's troposphere has been inferred from the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) Juno data. Measurements allow us to retrieve the vertically averaged concentration of gases between similar to 3 and 5 bars from infrared-bright spectra. Results were used to create latitudinal profiles. The water vapor relative humidity varies with latitude from <1% to over 15%. At intermediate latitudes (30-70 degrees) the water vapor maxima are associated with the location of cyclonic belts, as inferred from mean zonal wind profiles (Porco et al., 2003). The high-latitude regions (beyond 60 degrees) are drier in the north (mean relative humidity around 2-3%) than the south, where humidity reaches 15% around the pole. The ammonia volume mixing ratio varies from 1 x 10(-4) to 4 x 10(-4). A marked minimum exists around 10 degrees N, while data suggest an increase over the equator. The high-latitude regions are different in the two hemispheres, with a gradual increase in the south and more constant values with latitude in the north. The phosphine volume mixing ratio varies from 4 x 10(-7) to 10 x 10(-7). A marked minimum exists in the North Equatorial Belt. For latitudes poleward 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N, the northern hemisphere appears richer in phosphine, with a decrease toward the pole, while the opposite is observed in the south. JIRAM data indicate an increase of germane volume mixing ratio from 2 x 10(-10) to 8 x 10(-10) from both poles to 15 degrees S, with a depletion centered around the equator. Arsine presents the opposite trend, with maximum values of 6 x 10(-10) at the two poles and minima below 1 x 10(-10) around 20 degrees S.

On-Deck Seismology: Lessons from InSight for Future Planetary Seismology	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article							NETWORK SCIENCE; NOISE; MARS; SEISMOMETER; NETLANDER; MISSION; LANDER; MODEL	Before deploying to the surface of Mars, the short-period (SP) seismometer of the InSight mission operated on deck for a total of 48 hr. This data set can be used to understand how deck-mounted seismometers can be used in future landed missions to Mars, Europa, and other planetary bodies. While operating on deck, the SP seismometer showed signals comparable to the Viking-2 seismometer near 3 Hz where the sensitivity of the Viking instrument peaked. Wind sensitivity showed similar patterns to the Viking instrument, although amplitudes on InSight were similar to 80% larger for a given wind velocity. However, during the low-wind evening hours, the instrument noise levels at frequencies between 0.1 and 1 Hz were comparable to quiet stations on Earth, although deployment to the surface below the Wind and Thermal Shield lowered installation noise by roughly 40 dB in acceleration power. With the observed noise levels and estimated seismicity rates for Mars, detection probability for quakes for a deck-mounted instrument is low enough that up to years of on-deck recordings may be necessary to observe an event. Because the noise is dominated by wind acting on the lander, though, deck-mounted seismometers may be more practical for deployment on airless bodies, and it is important to evaluate the seismicity of the target body and the specific design of the lander. Detection probabilities for operation on Europa reach over 99% for some proposed seismicity models for a similar duration of operation if noise levels are comparable to low-wind time periods on Mars.

An Impact Crater Origin for the InSight Landing Site at Homestead Hollow, Mars: Implications for Near Surface Stratigraphy, Surface Processes, and Erosion Rates	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						InSight; impact craters; erosion rates; mars; Homestead hollow; landing site	RECENT ICE AGES; COSMOGENIC NUCLIDES; SINUS SABAEUS; DEGRADATION; WATER; PRECIPITATION; CHRONOLOGY; TRANSPORT	The InSight mission to Mars landed within Homestead hollow on an Early Amazonian lava plain. The hollow is a 27-m-diameter, 0.3-m-deep quasi-circular depression that shares morphologic and sedimentologic characteristics to degraded impact craters. Unlike the intercrater plains outside of the hollow, the interior lacks cobbles and is dominated by loose sand, granules, and pebbles. Fresher craters near the landing site exhibit meter-scale bedforms in their ejecta and on their floors due to sediment trapping. The sedimentology of the interior fill of Homestead hollow suggests similar trapping. The hollow falls along a morphologic continuum that requires low rates of rim degradation and fill. Crater degradation rates (rim erosion plus filling) in the landing site decline nonlinearly through time from 10(-2) to 10(-4) m/Myr as craters evolve to a hollow-like form. Rim erosion rates are lower initially, at 10(-3) m/Myr, but converge with degradation rates to 10(-4) m/Myr. This implies that while filling plays an important role soon after crater formation, it is limited in later stages. Crater statistics indicate that the bulk of the fill occurred in the first similar to 50 Myr for Homestead hollow. The estimated maximum age of the hollow is similar to 400 to 700 Myr. This requires near-zero fill aggradation and long-term soil stability for the bulk of the crater's history. Fill stability manifests in Homestead hollow as a similar to 5- to 10-cm-thick duricrust, formed by exchanges of atmospheric water vapor with soil. The estimated degradation in the hollow requires similar to 2 to 3 m of sedimentary fill beneath the lander.	[Warner, N.

Shaping nonlinear optical response using nonlocal forward Brillouin interactions	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						nonlocal optical response; Brillouin scattering; opto-mechanical coupling; nonlinear optics	WAVE-GUIDES; DISPERSION; SCATTERING; INITIATION; INDEX; LIGHT	In most practical scenarios, optical susceptibilities can be treated as a local property of a medium. For example, in the context of nonlinear optics we can typically treat the Kerr and Raman response as local, such that optical fields at one location do not produce a nonlinear response at distinct locations in space. This is because the electronic and vibrational disturbances produced within the material are confined to a region that is smaller than an optical wavelength. By comparison, Brillouin interactions, mediated by traveling-wave acoustic phonons, can result in a highly nonlocal nonlinear response as the elastic waves generated in the process can occupy a region in space much larger than an optical wavelength. The unique properties of these interactions can be exploited to engineer new types of processes, where highly delocalized phonon modes serve as an engineerable channel that mediates scattering processes between light waves propagating in distinct optical waveguides. These types of nonlocal optomechanical responses have recently been demonstrated as the basis for information transduction, however the nontrivial dynamics of such systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we show that the third-order nonlinear process resulting from spatially extended Brillouin-active phonon modes involves mixing products from spatially separated, optically decoupled waveguides, yielding a nonlocal susceptibility. Building on these concepts, we illustrate how nontrivial multi-mode acoustic interference can produce a nonlocal susceptibility with a multi-pole frequency response, as the basis for new optical and microwave signal processing schemes within traveling wave systems.

The Observational Selection Function for Milky Way Satellites in DES Y3 and Pan-STARRS DR1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Dwarf spheroidal galaxies; Local Group; Dark matter; Milky Way Galaxy	FAINT DWARF GALAXIES; LOCAL GROUP; ANGULAR MASKS; BLACK-HOLE; DISCOVERY; REIONIZATION; COMPANION; CONSTELLATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; POPULATION	We report the results of a systematic search for ultra-faint Milky Way satellite galaxies using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Pan-STARRS1 (PS1). Together, DES and PS1 provide multi-band photometry in optical/near-infrared wavelengths over similar to 80% of the sky. Our search for satellite galaxies targets similar to 25,000 deg(2) of the high-Galactic-latitude sky reaching a 10 sigma point-source depth of greater than or similar to 22.5 mag in the g and r bands. While satellite galaxy searches have been performed independently on DES and PS1 before, this is the first time that a self-consistent search is performed across both data sets. We do not detect any new high-significance satellite galaxy candidates, recovering the majority of satellites previously detected in surveys of comparable depth. We characterize the sensitivity of our search using a large set of simulated satellites injected into the survey data. We use these simulations to derive both analytic and machine-learning models that accurately predict the detectability of Milky Way satellites as a function of their distance, size, luminosity, and location on the sky. To demonstrate the utility of this observational selection function, we calculate the luminosity function of Milky Way satellite galaxies, assuming that the known population of satellite galaxies is representative of the underlying distribution. We provide access to our observational selection function to facilitate comparisons with cosmological models of galaxy formation and evolution.	[Drlica-Wagner, A.; Li, T.

In this study, the isolated invariant set, or the invariant three-sphere of solutions, is studied using the asymptotic approaches of the stable manifold to the periodic and quasiperiodic orbits contained within the invariant three-sphere. A new bisection method is used to compute trajectories that follow the invariant three-sphere and study these trajectories in more detail. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unveiling the Merger Dynamics of the Most Massive MaDCoWS Cluster at z=1.2 from a Multiwavelength Mapping of Its Intracluster Medium Properties	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy clusters; Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect; X-ray astronomy; High-redshift galaxy clusters; Intracluster medium; Cool cores	GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY; PRESSURE PROFILE; TEMPERATURE; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; ABUNDANCES; COSMOLOGY; RADIATION; IMPACT	The characterization of the Intracluster Medium (ICM) properties of high-redshift galaxy clusters is fundamental to our understanding of large-scale structure formation processes. We present the results of a multiwavelength analysis of the very massive cluster MOO J1142+1527 at a redshift z = 1.2 discovered as part of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. This analysis is based on high angular resolution Chandra X-ray and NIKA2 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data. The cluster thermodynamic radial profiles have been obtained with unprecedented precision at this redshift and up to 0.7R(500), thanks to the combination of high-resolution X-ray and SZ data. The comparison between the galaxy distribution mapped in infrared by Spitzer and the morphological properties of the ICM derived from the combined analysis of the Chandra and NIKA2 data leads us to the conclusion that the cluster is an ongoing merger. We have estimated a systematic uncertainty on the cluster total mass that characterizes both the impact of the observed deviations from spherical symmetry and of the core dynamics on the mass profile. We further combine the X-ray and SZ data at the pixel level to obtain maps of the temperature and entropy distributions. We find a relatively low-entropy core at the position of the X-ray peak and high-temperature regions located on its south and west sides. This work demonstrates that the addition of spatially resolved SZ observations to low signal-to-noise X-ray data brings a high information gain on the characterization of the evolution of ICM thermodynamic properties at z > 1.

We report results from Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared time-series spectroscopic observations of three companions with masses in or near the planetary regime: VHS J125601.92-125723.9 b, GSC 6214-210 B, and ROXs 42 B b. VHS J1256-1257 b exhibits strong total intensity and spectral variability with a brightness difference of 19.3% between 1.1 and 1.7 mu m over 8.5 hr and even higher variability at the 24.7% level at 1.27 mu m. The light curve of VHS J1256-1257 b continues to rise at the end of the observing sequence so these values represent lower limits on the full variability amplitude at this epoch. This observed variability rivals (and may surpass) the most variable brown dwarf currently known, 2MASS J21392676+0220226. The implied rotation period of VHS J1256-1257 b is 21-24 hr assuming sinusoidal modulations, which is unusually long for substellar objects. No significant variability is evident in the light curves of GSC 6214-210 B (<1.2%) and ROXs 42 B b (<15.6%). With a spectral type of L7, an especially red spectrum, and a young age, VHS J1256-1257 b reinforces emerging patterns between high variability amplitude, low surface gravity, and evolutionary phase near the L/T transition.

Self-Powered Solar Aerial Vehicles: Towards Infinite Endurance UAVs	UNMANNED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Self-powered dynamic systems; energy-independent systems; optimal uncertainty quantification; solar-powered UAVs; self-sustain systems	AIRSHIP	A self-powered scheme is explored for achieving long-endurance operation, with the use of solar power and buoyancy lift. The end goal is the capability of "infinite" endurance while complying with the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) dynamics and the required control performance, maneuvering, and duty cycles. Nondimensional power terms related to the UAV power demand and solar energy input are determined in a framework of Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ). OUQ takes uncertainties and incomplete information in the dynamics and control, available solar energy, and the electric power demand of a solar UAV model into account, and provides an optimal solution for achieving a self-sustained system in terms of energy. Self-powered trajectory tracking, speed and control are discussed. Aerial vehicles of this class can overcome the flight time limitations of current electric UAVs, thereby meeting the needs of many applications. This paper serves as a reference in providing a generalized approach in design of self-powered solar electric multi-rotor UAVs.

Methane emissions from underground gas storage in California	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						methane; emissions; underground gas storage; Aliso Canyon; temporal variability; imaging spectrometer	IMAGING SPECTROSCOPY; CARBON-DIOXIDE; LOS-ANGELES; AIRBORNE; SYSTEM; GOSAT; FLUX	Accurate and timely detection, quantification, and attribution of methane emissions from Underground Gas Storage (UGS) facilities is essential for improving confidence in greenhouse gas inventories, enabling emission mitigation by facility operators, and supporting efforts to assess facility integrity and safety. We conducted multiple airborne surveys of the 12 active UGS facilities in California between January 2016 and November 2017 using advanced remote sensing and in situ observations of near-surface atmospheric methane (CH4). These measurements where combined with wind data to derive spatially and temporally resolved methane emission estimates for California UGS facilities and key components with spatial resolutions as small as 1-3 m and revisit intervals ranging from minutes to months. The study spanned normal operations, malfunctions, and maintenance activity from multiple facilities including the active phase of the Aliso Canyon blowout incident in 2016 and subsequent return to injection operations in summer 2017. We estimate that the net annual methane emissions from the UGS sector in California averaged between 11.0 3.8 GgCH(4) yr(-1) (remote sensing) and 12.3 3.8 GgCH(4) yr(-1) (in situ). Net annual methane emissions for the 7 facilities that reported emissions in 2016 were estimated between 9.0 3.2 GgCH(4) yr(-1) (remote sensing) and 9.5 3.2 GgCH(4) yr(-1) (in situ), in both cases around 5 times higher than reported. The majority of methane emissions from UGS facilities in this study are likely dominated by anomalous activity: higher than expected compressor loss and leaking bypass isolation valves. Significant variability was observed at different time-scales: daily compressor duty-cycles and infrequent but large emissions from compressor station blow-downs. This observed variability made comparison of remote sensing and in situ observations challenging given measurements were derived largely at different times, however, improved agreement occurred when comparing simultaneous measurements. Temporal variability in emissions remains one of the most challenging aspects of UGS emissions quantification, underscoring the need for more systematic and persistent methane monitoring.

The CatWISE Preliminary Catalog: Motions from WISE and NEOWISE Data	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES			English	Article						Catalogs; Sky surveys; Proper motions; Brown dwarfs; Infrared astronomy		CatWISE is a program to catalog sources selected from combined WISE and NEOWISE all-sky survey data at 3.4 and 4.6 mu m (W1 and W2). The CatWISE Preliminary Catalog consists of 900,849,014 sources measured in data collected from 2010 to 2016. This data set represents four times as many exposures and spans over 10 times as large a time baseline as that used for the AllWISE Catalog. CatWISE adapts AllWISE software to measure the sources in coadded images created from six-month subsets of these data, each representing one coverage of the inertial sky, or epoch. The catalog includes the measured motion of sources in eight epochs over the 6.5 yr span of the data. From comparison to Spitzer, signal-to-noise ratio = 5 limits in magnitudes in the Vega system are W1 = 17.67 and W2 = 16.47, compared to W1 = 16.96 and W2 = 16.02 for AllWISE. From comparison to Gaia, CatWISE positions have typical accuracies of 50 mas for stars at W1 = 10 mag and 275 mas for stars at W1 = 15.5 mag. Proper motions have typical accuracies of 10 mas yr(-1) and 30 mas yr(-1) for stars with these brightnesses, an order of magnitude better than from AllWISE. The catalog is available in the WISE/NEOWISE Enhanced and Contributed Products area of the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive.	[Eisenhardt, Peter R.

Iterative Rover-Copter Path Planning for Mars Exploration	IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS			English	Article						Cooperating robots; motion and path planning; multi-robot systems; space robotics and automation	UNCERTAINTY; LOCALIZATION	In addition to conventional ground rovers, the Mars 2020 mission will send a helicopter to Mars. The copter's high-resolution data helps the rover to identify small hazards such as steps and pointy rocks, as well as providing rich textual information useful to predict perception performance. In this letter, we consider a three-agent system composed of a Mars rover, copter, and orbiter. The objective is to provide good localization to the rover by selecting an optimal path that minimizes the localization uncertainty accumulation during the rover's traverse. To achieve this goal, we quantify the localizability as a goodness measure associated with the map, and conduct a joint-space search over rover's path and copter's perceptual actions given prior information from the orbiter. We jointly address where to map by the copter and where to drive by the rover using the proposed iterative copter-rover path planner. We conducted numerical simulations using the map of Mars 2020 landing site to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planner.

The gradient index is created by sub wavelength holes whose size increases with the radius of the lens. The effective refractive index created by the subwavelength holes is constant over a very wide bandwidth, allowing the fabrication of achromatic lenses up to submillimeter wavelengths. The designed GRIN lens was successfully simulated and shows an expected efficiency better than that of a classic silicon plano-concave spherical lens with approximately the same thickness and focal length. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and wafer-bonding of several patterned wafers will be used to realize our first GRIN lens prototype.	[Defrance, F.; Macioce, T.; Sayers, J.; Golwala, S.

PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll (APAR(chl)) is directly linked to vegetation photosynthesis and can be used to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence has very tight relationship with APAR(chl) at various ecosystems. Therefore, the solar angle normalized SIF (nSIF) is directly related to the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)). This paper intercompared six space FPAR products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Their potential relationships with FPAR(chl) were indirectly evaluated with both spaceborne (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) and airborne (Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, CFIS) nSIF data as well as in situ GPP measurements. Our results show that these FPAR products are different in terms of amplitudes and seasonal variations across biomes. Among six FPAR products, OLCI FPAR shows the best relationships with TROPOMI nSIF740, OCO-2 nSIF757, and CFIS nSIF755. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the relationship between OLCI FPAR and TROPOMI nSIF740 is 0.79 +/- 0.17 on a global average. APAR calculated from OLCI also exhibits the best relationship (R-2 = 0.79) with in situ GPP over 25 flux towers.

Magellan/IMACS Spectroscopy of the Ultra-faint Satellites Grus II, Tucana IV, and Tucana V	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							DWARF SPHEROIDAL GALAXIES; DARK-MATTER ANNIHILATION; MILKY-WAY; VELOCITY DISPERSION; CLOUD; MASS; DYNAMICS; CLUSTERS; ORPHAN; CONSTELLATION	We present Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of three recently discovered ultra-faint Milky Way satellites, Grus.II, Tucana.IV, and Tucana.V. We measure systemic velocities of vhel = -110.0. 0.5 km s-1, = v 15.9+ hel 1.71.8 km s-1, and = - v 36.2+ hel 2.22.5 km s-1 for the three objects, respectively. Their large relative velocities demonstrate that the satellites are unrelated despite their close physical proximity. We determine a velocity dispersion for Tuc.IV of s = 4.3+ 1.01.7 km s-1, but we cannot resolve the velocity dispersions of the other two systems. For Gru.II, we place an upper limit (90%.confidence) on the dispersion of s.<.1.9 km s-1, and for Tuc.V, we do not obtain any useful limits. All three satellites have metallicities below[Fe H] = -2.1, but none has a detectable metallicity spread. We determine proper motions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their orbits around the Milky Way. Gru.II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of 25+ 76 kpc and orbital eccentricity of 0.45+ 0.050.08. Tuc.V likely has an apocenter beyond 100.kpc and could be approaching the Milky Way for the first time. The current orbit of Tuc.IV is similar to that of Gru.II, with a pericenter of 25+ 811 kpc and an eccentricity of 0.36+ 0.060.13. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc.IV demonstrates that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact parameter of 4. kpc 120.Myr ago, deflecting its trajectory and possibly altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and metallicities, we classify Gru.II and Tuc.IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but the nature of Tuc.V remains uncertain.	[Simon, J. D.; Li, T.

The probe is an Si microcantilever on which a two-layer piezoelectric stack transducer is microfabricated. The top transducer in the stack functions as an actuator, while the bottom transducer is used as a deflection sensor. This arrangement leads to a collocated actuator-sensor pair that co-exist on the same surface area. We report experimental results that establish the sensor's ability to capture the full dynamic range of the cantilever with minimal feedthrough from the actuator.

An Optical Model for Quantitative Raman Microspectroscopy	APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Raman spectroscopy; quantitative Raman; optical modeling; organic compound detection; detection limits; Mars 2020	CROSS-SECTIONS; SPECTROSCOPY; MATTER; DNA	Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable technique for identifying compounds by the unique pattern of their molecular vibrations and is capable of quantifying the individual concentrations of those compounds provided that certain parameters about the sample and instrument are known. We demonstrate the development of an optical model to describe the intensity distribution of incident laser photons as they pass through the sample volume, determine the limitations of that volume that may be detected by the spectrometer optics, and account for light absorption by molecules within the sample in order to predict the total Raman intensity that would be obtained from a given, uniform sample such as an aqueous solution. We show that the interplay between the shape and divergence of the laser beam, the position of the focal plane, and the dimensions of the spectrometer slit are essential to explaining experimentally observed trends in deep ultraviolet Raman intensities obtained from both planar and volumetric samples, including highly oriented pyrolytic graphite and binary mixtures of organic nucleotides. This model offers the capability to predict detection limits for organic compounds in different matrices based on the parameters of the spectrometer, and to define the upper/lower limits within which concentration can be reliably determined from Raman intensity for such samples. We discuss the potential to quantify more complex samples, including as solid phase mixtures of organics and minerals, that are investigated by the unique instrument parameters of the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) investigation on the upcoming Mars 2020 rover mission.

We present and statistically analyze the results from the LBTI/Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems survey for exozodiacal dust. By comparing our measurements to model predictions based on the solar zodiacal dust in the N band, we estimate a 1 sigma median sensitivity of 23 zodis times the solar system dust surface density in its habitable zone (HZ; 23 zodis) for early-type stars and 48 zodis for Sun-like stars, where 1 zodi is the surface density of HZ dust in the solar system. Of the 38 stars observed, 10 show significant excess. A clear correlation of our detections with the presence of cold dust in the systems was found, but none with the stellar spectral type or age. The majority of Sun-like stars have relatively low HZ dust levels (best-fit median: 3 zodis, 1 sigma upper limit: 9 zodis, 95% confidence: 27 zodis based on our N band measurements), while similar to 20% are significantly more dusty. The solar system's HZ dust content is consistent with being typical. Our median HZ dust level would not be a major limitation to the direct imaging search for Earth-like exoplanets, but more precise constraints are still required, in particular to evaluate the impact of exozodiacal dust for the spectroscopic characterization of imaged exo-Earth candidates.

On Frequency-dependent Dispersion Measures and Extreme Scattering Events	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Radio pulsars; Interstellar medium; Interstellar plasma; Pulsar timing method	INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; TIMING OBSERVATIONS; SPIN NOISE; PRECISION; PULSARS; PROPAGATION; VARIABILITY; MODEL; SCINTILLATIONS; POLARIZATION	Radio emission propagating over an Earth-pulsar line of sight provides a unique probe of the intervening ionized interstellar medium (ISM). Variations in the integrated electron column density along this line of sight, or dispersion measure (DM), have been observed since shortly after the discovery of pulsars. As early as 2006, frequency-dependent DMs have been observed and attributed to several possible causes. Ray-path averaging over different effective light-cone volumes through the turbulent ISM contributes to this effect, as will DM misestimation due to radio propagation across compact lensing structures such as those caused by "extreme scattering events (ESEs)." We present methods to assess the variations in frequency-dependent DMs due to the turbulent ISM versus these compact lensing structures along the line of sight. We analyze recent Low-Frequency Array observations of PSR J2219+4754 to test the underlying physical mechanism of the observed frequency-dependent DM. Previous analyses have indicated the presence of strong lensing due to compact overdensities halfway between the Earth and pulsar. Instead, we find the frequency dependence of the DM time series for PSR J2219+4754 is consistent with being due solely to ISM turbulence and there is no evidence for any ESE or small-scale lensing structure. The data show possible deviations from a uniform turbulent medium, suggesting that there may be an enhanced scattering screen near one of the two ends of the line of sight. We present this analysis as an example of the power of low-frequency observations to distinguish the underlying mechanisms in frequency-dependent propagation effects.	[Lam, M.

We outline in detail the spectroscopic data and selection of the galaxies as well as the ground- and space-based imaging products. In addition, we provide several basic measurements including stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) luminosities, UV continuum slopes (beta), and absorption line redshifts, as well as H alpha emission derived from Spitzer colors. We find that the ALPINE sample is representative of the 4 z < 6 galaxy population selected by photometric methods and only slightly biased toward bluer colors (Delta beta similar to 0.2). Using [] as tracer of the systemic redshift (confirmed for one galaxy at z = 4.5 out of 118 for which we obtained optical [lambda 3727A emission), we confirm redshifted Ly alpha emission and blueshifted absorption lines similar to findings at lower redshifts. By stacking the rest-frame UV spectra in the [] rest frame, we find that the absorption lines in galaxies with high specific SFR are more blueshifted, which could be indicative of stronger winds and outflows.

BUFFALO will expand existing coverage of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) in Wide Field Camera 3/IR F105W, F125W, and F160W and Advanced Camera for Surveys/WFC F606W and F814W around each of the six HFF clusters and flanking fields. This additional area has not been observed by HST but is already covered by deep multiwavelength data sets, including Spitzer and Chandra. As with the original HFF program, BUFFALO is designed to take advantage of gravitational lensing from massive clusters to simultaneously find high-redshift galaxies that would otherwise lie below HST detection limits and model foreground clusters to study the properties of dark matter and galaxy assembly. The expanded area will provide the first opportunity to study both cosmic variance at high redshift and galaxy assembly in the outskirts of the large HFF clusters. Five additional orbits are reserved for transient follow-up. BUFFALO data including mosaics, value-added catalogs, and cluster mass distribution models will be released via MAST on a regular basis as the observations and analysis are completed for the six individual clusters.

The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) collected Jupiter images from 236 to 925 nm in 14 filters. The Near-Infrared Imager (NIRI) at Gemini North imaged Jovian thermal emission using a lucky-imaging approach (co-adding the sharpest frames taken from a sequence of short exposures), using the M ' filter at 4.7 mu m. We discuss the data acquisition and processing and an archive collection that contains the processed WFC3 and NIRI data (doi:). Zonal winds remain steady over time at most latitudes, but significant evolution of the wind profile near 24 degrees N in 2016 and near 15 degrees S in 2017 was linked with convective superstorm eruptions. Persistent mesoscale waves were seen throughout the 2016-2019 period. We link groups of lightning flashes observed by the Juno team with water clouds in a large convective plume near 15 degrees S and in cyclones near 35 degrees N-55 degrees N. Thermal infrared maps at the 10.8 micron wavelength obtained at the Very Large Telescope show consistent high brightness temperature anomalies, despite a diversity of aerosol properties seen in the HST data. Both WFC3 and NIRI imaging reveal depleted aerosols consistent with downwelling around the periphery of the 15 degrees S storm, which was also observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. NIRI imaging of the Great Red Spot shows that locally reduced cloud opacity is responsible for dark features within the vortex. The HST data maps multiple concentric polar hoods of high-latitude hazes.

Short-Term Stable Isotope Probing of Proteins Reveals Taxa Incorporating Inorganic Carbon in a Hot Spring Microbial Mat	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Mushroom Spring; geochemistry; inorganic carbon uptake; metaproteomics; microbial mat; phototrophy; stable isotope probing; stable isotope signature; stromatolite	CHLORACIDOBACTERIUM-THERMOPHILUM; ACCURATE MASS; GEN. NOV.; BACTERIA; FIXATION; IDENTIFICATION; SIP; CYANOBACTERIA; FERMENTATION; METABOLISM	The upper green layer of the chlorophototrophic microbial mats associated with the alkaline siliceous hot springs of Yellowstone National Park consists of oxygenic cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), anoxygenic Roseiflexus spp., and several other anoxygenic chlorophototrophs. Synechococcus spp. are believed to be the main fixers of inorganic carbon (C-i), but some evidence suggests that Roseiflexus spp. also contribute to inorganic carbon fixation during low-light, anoxic morning periods. Contributions of other phototrophic taxa have not been investigated. In order to follow the pathway of C-i incorporation into different taxa, mat samples were incubated with [(13)Clbicarbonate for 3 h during the early-morning, low-light anoxic period. Extracted proteins were treated with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry, leading to peptide identifications and peptide isotopic profile signatures containing evidence of C-13 label incorporation. A total of 25,483 peptides, corresponding to 7,221 proteins, were identified from spectral features and associated with mat taxa by comparison to metagenomic assembly sequences. A total of 1,417 peptides, derived from 720 proteins, were detectably labeled with C-13. Most C-13-labeled peptides were derived from proteins of Synechococcus spp. and Roseiflexus spp. Chaperones and proteins of carbohydrate metabolism were most abundantly labeled. Proteins involved in photosynthesis, C-i fixation, and N-2 fixation were also labeled in Synechococcus spp. Importantly, most proteins of the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for C-i fixation in Roseiflexus spp. were labeled, establishing that members of this taxocene contribute to C-i fixation. Other taxa showed much lower [C-13]bicarbonate incorporation. IMPORTANCE Yellowstone hot spring mats have been studied as natural models for understanding microbial community ecology and as modern analogs of stromatolites, the earliest community fossils on Earth. Stable-isotope probing of proteins (ProSIP) permitted short-term interrogation of the taxa that are involved in the impor tant process of light-driven C-i fixation in this highly active community and will be useful in linking other metabolic processes to mat taxa. Here, evidence is presented copyright that Roseiflexus spp., which use the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle, are active in C-i fix ation. Because this pathway imparts a lower degree of selection of isotopically heavy C-i than does the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the results suggest a mechanism to explain why the natural abundance of C-13 in mat biomass is greater than expected if only the latter pathway were involved. Understanding how mat community members influence the C-13/C-12 ratios of mat biomass will help geochemists interpret the C-13/C-12 ratios of organic carbon in the fossil record.

J	Damiano, M; Hu, RY				Damiano, Mario; Hu, Renyu			EXORELR: A Bayesian Inverse Retrieval Framework for Exoplanetary Reflected Light Spectra	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							EXTRASOLAR GIANT PLANETS; CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION; JOVIAN PLANETS; METHANE; PHASE; WATER; CLEAR; MASS; SPECTROSCOPY	The high-contrast imaging technique is meant to provide insight into those planets orbiting several astronomical units from their host star. Space missions such as Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope, Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission, and Large Ultra-Violet/Optical/InfraRed Surveyor will measure reflected light spectra of cold gaseous and rocky planets. To interpret these observations, we introduce EXORELR (Exoplanetary Reflected Light Retrieval), a novel Bayesian retrieval framework to retrieve cloud properties and atmospheric structures from exoplanetary reflected light spectra. As a unique feature, it assumes a vertically nonuniform volume mixing ratio (VMR) profile of water and ammonia, and uses it to construct cloud densities. In this way, clouds and molecular mixture ratios are consistent. We apply EXORELR on three test cases: two exoplanets (v And e and 47 Uma b) and Jupiter. We show that we are able to retrieve the concentration of methane in the atmosphere, and estimate the position of clouds when the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is higher than 15, in line with previous works. Moreover, we described the ability of our model to give a chemical identity to clouds, and we discussed whether or not we can observe this difference in the planetary reflection spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how it could be possible to retrieve molecular concentrations (water and ammonia in this work) below the clouds by linking the nonuniform VMR profile to the cloud presence. This will help to constrain the concentration of water and ammonia unseen in direct measurements.

From drought to flood: A water balance analysis of the Tuolumne River basin during extreme conditions (2015-2017)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						data assimilation; evapotranspiration; headwater catchment hydrology; Lidar; snow modelling; spatial variability; water balance; water resources	SIERRA-NEVADA; SNOW ACCUMULATION; GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; FOREST; CLIMATE; MODIS; EVAPORATION; SENSITIVITY	The degree to which the hydrologic water balance in a snow-dominated headwater catchment is affected by annual climate variations is difficult to quantify, primarily due to uncertainties in measuring precipitation inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses. Over a recent three-year period, the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada fluctuated from the lightest in recorded history (2015) to historically heaviest (2017), with a relatively average year in between (2016). This large dynamic range in climatic conditions presents a unique opportunity to investigate correlations between annual water availability and runoff in a snow-dominated catchment. Here, we estimate ET using a water balance approach where the water inputs to the system are spatially constrained using a combination of remote sensing, physically based modelling, and in-situ observations. For all 3 years of this study, the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) combined periodic high-resolution snow depths from airborne Lidar with snow density estimates from an energy and mass balance model to produce spatial estimates of snow water equivalent over the Tuolumne headwater catchment at 50-m resolution. Using observed reservoir inflow at the basin outlet and the well-quantified snowmelt model results that benefit from periodic ASO snow depth updates, we estimate annual ET, runoff efficiency (RE), and the associated uncertainty across these three dissimilar water years. Throughout the study period, estimated annual ET magnitudes remained steady (222 mm in 2015, 151 mm in 2016, and 299 mm in 2017) relative to the large differences in basin input precipitation (547 mm in 2015, 1,060 mm in 2016, and 2,211 mm in 2017). These values compare well with independent satellite-derived ET estimates and previously published studies in this basin. Results reveal that ET in the Tuolumne does not scale linearly with the amount of available water to the basin, and that RE primarily depends on total annual snowfall proportion of precipitation.

Autonomous in-orbit satellite assembly from a modular heterogeneous swarm	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Self-assembly; Optimal guidance and control; Satellite; Docking; Optimal assignment; Swarm systems	ASSIGNMENT; SPACECRAFT	This paper presents a decentralized, distributed guidance and control scheme to combine a heterogeneous swarm of component satellites into a large satellite structure. The component satellites for the heterogeneous swarm are chosen to promote flexibility in final shape inspired by crystal structures and Islamic tile art. After the ideal fundamental building blocks are selected, basic nanosatellite-class satellite designs are made to assist in simulations involving attitude control. The Swarm Orbital Construction Algorithm (SOCA) is a guidance and control algorithm to allow for the limited type heterogeneity and docking ability required for in-orbit assembly. The algorithm consists of two parts, a distributed auction which uses barrier functions to ensure the proper agent selection for each target, and a trajectory generation portion which leverages model predictive control and sequential convex programming to achieve optimal collision-free trajectories to the desired target point even with nonlinear system dynamics. The optimization constraints use a boundary layer to determine whether the collision avoidance or the docking constraints should be applied. The algorithm was tested in a simulated perturbed 6-DOF spacecraft dynamic environment for planar and out-of-plane final structures and on two robotic platforms, including a swarm of frictionless spacecraft simulation robots.

This paper reviews a sensor web concept in which a number of volcano monitoring systems were linked together to more accurately monitor volcanic activity, and used this activity measurement to automatically task space assets to acquire further satellite imagery of the detected volcanic activity. This paper discusses the space and ground sensors and how they were linked together as triggers and responses. Over a 13-year period, more than 160,000 alerts coming from various sources lead to 9050 observations by NASA's Earth Observing-1 spacecraft-imaging about 218 volcanoes. This paper describes the science products automatically produced onboard the satellite and on the ground such as temperature maps and lava discharge volume estimates that are automatically delivered to subscribing users. To evaluate the effectiveness of an out-tasked volcano monitoring system, this study compares the hit rate of our tasked monitoring system to the systematic monitoring system MODVOLC.

Urban Tracer Dispersion and Infiltration into Buildings Over a 2-km Scale	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY			English	Article						Air pollution; Dispersion; Perfluorocarbons; Pollutant infiltration; Tracer gases	CENTRAL LONDON; STREET; POLLUTANTS; FLOW	Field experiments were undertaken in the summer of 2015 in Manchester, UK, to investigate the dispersion behaviour and infiltration into buildings of gas-phase pollutants over horizontal distances of 1-5 km. Inert cyclic perfluorocarbon tracers were released for 15 min at either one or three release points and samples taken in locations indoors and outdoors up to 2 km downwind. Background measurements of these cyclic perfluorocarbons range between 5.6 and 12.6 parts per quadrillion (ppq). On most occasions, tracer concentrations are higher on the sixth floor than at ground level. Tracer concentrations persist in the least well-ventilated rooms after concentrations return to background levels outdoors. The highest tracer concentrations, 329 ppq above background, occur at dawn on 23 July from a sixth-floor sampling position during thermally stable conditions. At low wind speeds, tracer is detected upwind of the prevailing wind direction; on 24 July, tracer is detected to the north-west of the release point for north-north-east wind direction. A simple street network model does not predict tracer concentrations at low wind speeds over the km scales in this investigation due to tracer likely escaping the urban canopy. Predictions from a simple correlation model overestimate concentrations originating from distant sources, which is believed to be due to infiltration into buildings along the journey from source to receptor. A Gaussian plume model predicts the highest tracer concentrations for most receptor points on 23 July when the lowest Obukhov length of - 26 m was measured, agreeing with tracer measurements.

Arecibo Radar Astrometry of the Galilean Satellites from 1999 to 2016	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Astrometry; Radar astronomy; Galilean satellites	OUTER PLANETS; MUTUAL APPROXIMATIONS; ECLIPSE OBSERVATIONS; FASTT OBSERVATIONS; SHAPE; POSITIONS; IO; EPHEMERIDES; GANYMEDE; JUPITER	Harmon et al. Arecibo radar observations from 1992 provided some of the most precise line-of-sight distance (ranging) measurements of Ganymede and Callisto to date. We report 18 new ranges obtained at Arecibo from 1999 to 2016, among which are the first measurements of Io and Europa. We also report accompanying line-of-sight velocity (Doppler frequency) measurements. In 2015, we detected Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto with time-delay (range) resolutions as fine as 10 mu s (1.5 km) while Io was detected with 70 mu s (10.5 km) resolution. We estimated residuals for the radar measurements with respect to the latest JPL satellite ephemeris JUP310 and planetary ephemeris DE438. We found that the rms of the time-delay residuals are 29 mu s for Io, 21 mu s for Europa, 58 mu s for Ganymede, and 275 mu s for Callisto. When normalized by the measurement uncertainties, these correspond to the rms of 0.82, 1.25, 2.17, and 3.17 respectively. As such, the orbit of Callisto has the largest residuals and may benefit from an orbital update that will use radar astrometry. All Doppler residuals were small and consistent with their 1 sigma uncertainties.	[Brozovic, Marina; Folkner, William M.; Jacobson, Robert A.; Harcke, Leif J.; McMichael, Joseph G.; Benner, Lance A.

Solar Contamination in Extreme-precision Radial-velocity Measurements: Deleterious Effects and Prospects for Mitigation	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Exoplanet astronomy; Radial velocity; High resolution spectroscopy; Sky brightness; Astronomy data analysis	NIGHT-SKY; KITT PEAK; SPECTROGRAPH; SPECTRUM; PLANETS	Solar contamination, due to moonlight and atmospheric scattering of sunlight, can cause systematic errors in stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements that significantly detract from the similar to 10 cm s(-1) sensitivity required for the detection and characterization of terrestrial exoplanets in or near habitable zones of Sun-like stars. The addition of low-level spectral contamination at variable effective velocity offsets introduces systematic noise when measuring velocities using classical mask-based or template-based cross-correlation techniques. Here we present simulations estimating the range of RV measurement error induced by uncorrected scattered sunlight contamination. We explore potential correction techniques, using both simultaneous spectrometer sky fibers and broadband imaging via coherent fiber imaging bundles, that could reliably reduce this source of error to below the photon-noise limit of typical stellar observations. We discuss the limitations of these simulations, the underlying assumptions, and mitigation mechanisms. We also present and discuss the components designed and built into the NEID (NN-EXPLORE Exoplanet Investigations with Doppler spectroscopy) precision RV instrument for the WIYN 3.5 m telescope, to serve as an ongoing resource for the community to explore and evaluate correction techniques. We emphasize that while "bright time" has been traditionally adequate for RV science, the goal of 10 cm s(-1) precision on the most interesting exoplanetary systems may necessitate access to darker skies for these next-generation instruments.

Optimal Guidance and Control with Nonlinear Dynamics Using Sequential Convex Programming	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AIAA Science and Technology Forum and Exposition (SciTech)	JAN 07-11, 2019	San Diego, CA	AIAA			TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; GENERATION; SWARM	This paper presents a novel method for expanding the use of sequential convex programming (SCP) to the domain of optimal guidance and control problems with nonlinear dynamics constraints. SCP is a useful tool in obtaining real-time solutions to direct optimal control, but it is unable to adequately model nonlinear dynamics due to the linearization and discretization required. As nonlinear program solvers are not yet functioning in real-time, a tool is needed to bridge the gap between satisfying the nonlinear dynamics and completing execution fast enough to be useful. Two methods are proposed, SCP with nonlinear dynamics correction (SCPn) and modified SCPn (M-SCPn), which mixes SCP and SCPn to reduce runtime and improve algorithmic robustness. Both methods are proven to generate optimal state and control trajectories that satisfy the nonlinear dynamics. Simulations are presented to validate the efficacy of the methods as compared with SCP.

In its complete form, this process is formulated as a nonlinear constrained stochastic optimal control problem. This problem is among the most complex in control theory, and no practically applicable method to low-thrust trajectory optimization problems has been proposed to date. This paper presents a new algorithm to solve stochastic optimal control problems with nonlinear systems and constraints. The proposed algorithm uses the unscented transform to convert a stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic problem, which is then solved by trajectory optimization methods such as differential dynamic programming. Two numerical examples, one of which applies the proposed method to low-thrust trajectory design, illustrate that it automatically introduces margins that improve robustness. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the robustness and optimality of the solution.

The proposed method exploits the dynamical property of fluid flowing through a porous medium. This method evaluates risk to generate porosity values throughout the computational domain. The trajectory that encounters the highest porosity values determines the trajectory from the point of origin to the goal position. The best trajectory is found using the reaction of the fluid in porous media by the way of streamlines obtained by numerically solving the PDEs representing the fluid flow. Constraints due to UAV dynamics, obstacles, and predefined way points are applied to the problem after solving for the best trajectory to find the optimal and feasible trajectory. This method shows near-optimality and much reduced computational effort when compared to the other typical numerical optimization methods.

We demonstrate that by combining phase patterns with a polarization grating (PG) pattern directly followed by one or several separate PGs, we can suppress the polarization leakage terms by additional orders of magnitude by diffracting them out of the beam. Using two PGs composed of a single-layer liquid crystal structure in the lab, we demonstrate a leakage suppression of more than an order of magnitude over a bandwidth of 133 nm centered around 532 nm. At this center wavelength we measure a leakage suppression of three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, simulations indicate that a combination of two multi-layered liquid-crystal PGs can suppress leakage to mu m and <10(-10) for 650-800 nm. We introduce multi-grating solutions with three or more gratings that can be designed to have no separation of the two circular polarization states, and offer even deeper suppression of polarization leakage. We present simulations of a triple-grating solution that has <10(-10) leakage on the first Airy ring from 450 to 800 nm. We apply the double-grating concept to the Vector-vortex coronagraph of charge 4, and demonstrate in the lab that polarization leakage no longer limits the on-axis suppression for ground-based contrast levels. Lastly, we report on the successful installation and first-light results of a double-grating vector Apodizing Phase Plate pupil-plane coronagraph installed at the Large Binocular Telescope. We discuss the implications of these new coronagraph architectures for high-contrast imaging systems on the ground and in space.

Our eclipse results for 27 of these planets are new, and include highly irradiated worlds such as KELT-7b, WASP-87b, WASP-76b, and WASP-64b, and important targets for James Webb Space Telescope such as WASP-62b. We find that WASP-62b has a slightly eccentric orbit (<CDATA<i), and we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-13b and WASP-14b. The remainder are individually consistent with circular orbits, but we find statistical evidence for eccentricity increasing with orbital period in our range from 1 to 5 days. Our day-side brightness temperatures for the planets yield information on albedo and heat redistribution, following Cowan & Agol (2011). Planets having maximum day-side temperatures exceeding similar to 2200 K are consistent with having zero albedo and a distribution of stellar irradiance uniformly over the day-side hemisphere. Our most intriguing result is that we detect a systematic difference between the emergent spectra of these hot Jupiters as compared to blackbodies. The ratio of observed brightness temperatures, Tb(4.5)/Tb(3.6), increases with equilibrium temperature by 100 24 parts-per-million per Kelvin, over the entire temperature range in our sample (800-2500 K). No existing model predicts this trend over such a large range of temperature. We suggest that this may be due to a structural difference in the atmospheric temperature profiles of real planetary atmospheres as compared to models.

The lunar crust has low intrinsic abundances of the highly siderophile elements (HSE: Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Rh, Pd, Au), at greater than 3000 times lower than in chondrite meteorites. Consequently, during impact, bolides with chondritic or differentiated iron-rich compositions should impart elevated HSE signatures to the lunar crust. Here we examine glassy lunar impact melt coats (IMC) from the outside rims of Apollo 16 cataclastic anorthosites (60015, 65325) and breccias (65035), as well as both fragments and powders of Antarctic anorthositic regolith breccia (ARB) meteorites (Miller Range 090034/36/70/75 and MacAlpine Hills 88105) for their petrography, mineral chemistry and bulk-rock compositions. The HSE concentrations for IMC range from similar to 0.001 to 0.1 x CI chondrite, with measured Os-187/Os-188 between 0.1189 and 0.1366. Anorthositic regolith breccia meteorites, which have components with 2.6-4.1 Ga ages, have similar HSE concentrations to IMC, but typically have lower Os-187/Os-188 (0.1164-0.1284). These latter Os ratios are generally less radiogenic than those measured in similar to 3.8-3.9 Ga Apollo impact melt breccias. The Apollo 16 IMC are not well-dated, but their KREEPy trace-element signatures and associated ages of 3.7 to 3.8 Ga for Apollo 16 glasses might imply, at least in part, an origin from the Imbrium or Serenitatis basin-forming impacts. Within the IMC, metal-schreibersite-troilite assemblages record significant inter-element HSE fractionation which is also reflected in bulk HSE patterns for both IMC and ARB meteorites. Variations in relative and absolute HSE compositions directly reflect the control of metal and sulfide segregation within and between impact melt and breccia lithologies. Collectively, IMC and ARB meteorites exhibit approximately 50% of the variation in Ru/Ir and Os-187/Os-188 observed in lunar impact melt breccias. These results imply that significant variations in inter-element compositions can occur during impact brecciation and melting and so some impact melt rock HSE compositions may not record the compositions of impactors that struck the Moon with fidelity. Nonetheless, the generally low Re-1(87)/Os-1(88) of lunar impact melt rocks means that osmium isotope ratios provide evidence for impact composition, and a change from ordinary to carbonaceous-like impactors either with time - or location - striking the Moon.
