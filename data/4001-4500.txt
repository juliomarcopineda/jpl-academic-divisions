Private Polynomial Computation from Lagrange Encoding	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUL 07-12, 2019	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Informat Theory Soc, Huawei, TeSA, Qualcomm, CentraleSupelec, INP Toulouse, Mitsubishi Elect			INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL	Private computation is a generalization of private information retrieval, in which a user is able to compute a function on a distributed dataset without revealing the identity of that function to the servers that store the dataset. In this paper it is shown that Lagrange encoding, a recently suggested powerful technique for encoding Reed-Solomon codes, enables private computation in many cases of interest. In particular, we present a scheme that enables private computation of polynomials of any degree on Lagrange encoded data, while being robust to Byzantine and straggling servers, and to servers that collude in attempt to deduce the identities of the functions to be evaluated. Moreover, incorporating ideas from the well-known Shamir secret sharing scheme allows the data itself to be concealed from the servers as well. Our results extend private computation to non-linear polynomials and to data-privacy, and reveal a tight connection between private computation and coded computation.

A random coding technique is developed, and its power in analyzing the third-order coding performance is demonstrated in all three scenarios. Results include a third-order-optimal characterization of the Slepian-Wolf rate region and a proof showing that for dependent sources, the independent encoders used by Slepian-Wolf codes can achieve the same third-order-optimal performance as a single joint encoder. The concept of random access source coding, which generalizes the multiple access scenario to allow for a subset of participating encoders that is unknown a priori to both the encoders and the decoder, is introduced. Contributions include a new definition of the probabilistic model for a random access-discrete multiple source, a general random access source coding scheme that employs a rateless code with sporadic feedback, and an analysis demonstrating via a random coding argument that there exists a deterministic code of the proposed structure that simultaneously achieves the third-order-optimal performance of Slepian-Wolf codes for all possible subsets of encoders.

B	Raviv, N; Yu, Q; Bruck, J; Avestimehr, S			IEEE	Raviv, Netanel; Yu, Qian; Bruck, Jehoshua; Avestimehr, Salmon			Download and Access Trade-offs in Lagrange Coded Computing	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INFORMATION THEORY (ISIT)	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)	JUL 07-12, 2019	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Informat Theory Soc, Huawei, TeSA, Qualcomm, CentraleSupelec, INP Toulouse, Mitsubishi Elect				Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) is a recently proposed technique for resilient, secure, and private computation of arbitrary polynomials in distributed environments. By mapping such computations to composition of polynomials, LCC allows the master node to complete the computation by accessing a minimal number of workers and downloading all of their content, thus providing resiliency to the remaining stragglers. However, in the most common case in which the number of stragglers is less than in the worst case scenario, much of the computational power of the system remains unexploited. To amend this issue, in this paper we expand LCC by studying a fundamental trade-off between download and access, and present two contributions. In the first contribution, it is shown that without any modification to the encoding process, the master can decode the computations by accessing a larger number of nodes, however downloading less information from each node in comparison with LCC (i.e., trading access for download). This scheme relies on decoding a particular polynomial in the ideal that is generated by the polynomials of interest, a technique we call Ideal Decoding. This new scheme also improves LCC in the sense that for systems with adversaries, the overall downloaded bandwidth is smaller than in LCC. In the second contribution we study a real-time model of this trade-off, in which the data from the workers is downloaded sequentially. By clustering nodes of similar delays and encoding the function with Universally Decodable Matrices, the master can decode once sufficient data is downloaded from every cluster, regardless of the internal delays within that cluster. This allows the master to utilize the partial work that is done by stragglers, rather than to ignore it, a feature that most past works in coded computing are lacking.

We show a tight nonasymptotic exponentially decaying bound on the tail probability of the estimation error. Unlike previous works, our bound is tight already for a sample size of the order of hundreds. We apply the new estimation bound to find the dispersion for lossy compression of nonstationary Gauss-Markov sources. We show that the dispersion is given by the same integral formula derived in our previous work [1] for the (asymptotically) stationary Gauss-Markov sources, i.e., vertical bar a vertical bar < 1. New ideas in the nonstationary case include a deeper understanding of the scaling of the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the source sequence, and new techniques in the derivation of our estimation error bound.

Such a problem arises in applications where we can only make energy measurements of the underlying random variables. We study a simple LASSO-like convex recovery algorithm which involves a squared 2-norm (to match the covariance estimate to the measurements), plus a regularization term (that penalizes the l(1)-norm of the non-diagonal entries of Sigma(0) to enforce sparsity). When the measurement vectors are i.i.d. Gaussian, we obtain the precise error performance of the algorithm (accurately determining the estimation error in any metric, e.g., 2-norm, operator norm, etc.) as a function of the number of measurements and the underlying distribution of Sigma(0). In particular, in the noiseless case we determine the necessary and sufficient number of measurements required to perfectly recover Sigma(0) as a function of its sparsity. Our results rely on a novel comparison lemma which relates a convex optimization problem with "quadratic Gaussian" measurements to one which has i.i.d. Gaussian measurements.

Users with home batteries can mitigate this privacy loss by applying charging policies that mask their underlying energy use. A battery charging policy is proposed and shown to provide universal privacy guarantees subject to a constraint on energy cost. The guarantee bounds our strategy's maximal information leakage from the user to the utility provider under general stochastic models of user energy consumption. The policy construction adapts coding strategies for non-probabilistic permuting channels to this privacy problem.

In this setting, the secure multicast rate is well understood. Computing the secure multicast rate, or even the secure unicast rate, in the more general setting in which all network nodes may generate (independent) random keys is known to be as difficult as computing the (non-secure) capacity of multiple-unicast network coding instances - a well known open problem. This work treats an intermediate model of secure unicast in which only one node can generate random keys, however that node need not be the source node. The secure communication rate for this setting is characterized again with an eavesdropper that has access to z network links.

We show that exponentiating l = root-1 by these Z(4)-valued codewords produces stabilizer states, which are the common eigenvectors of maximal commutative subgroups (MCS) of the Pauli group. We use this quantum description to simplify the proof of the classical weight distribution of Kerdock codes. Next, we partition stabilizer states into N + 1 mutually unbiased bases and prove that automorphisms of the Kerdock code permute the associated MCS. This automorphism group, represented as symplectic matrices, is isomorphic to the projective special linear group PSL(2, N) and forms a unitary 2-design. The design described here was originally discovered by Cleve et al. (2016), but the connection to classical codes is new. This significantly simplifies the description of the design and its translation to circuits.

In this work we propose a novel way of computing surface folding maps via solving a linear PDE. This framework is a generalization of the existing computational quasi-conformal geometry and allows precise control of the geometry of folding. This property comes from a crucial quantity that occurs as the coefficient of the equation, namely, the alternating Beltrami coefficient. This approach also enables us to solve an inverse problem of parametrizing the folded surface given only partial data with known folding topology.

We introduce SAMMIE: Selections based on Autoencoder Modeling of Multispectral Image Expectations. Previous work using autoencoders employed the scalar reconstruction error to classify new images as novel or typical. We show that a spatial-spectral error map can enable both accurate classification of novelty in multispectral images as well as human-comprehensible explanations of the detection. We apply our methodology to the detection of novel geologic features in multispectral images of the Martian surface collected by the Mastcam imaging system on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover.

SUPERSONIC RETROPROPULSION ON ROBOTIC MARS LANDERS: SELECTED DESIGN TRADES	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm			DESCENT; ENTRY	Many concepts for future robotic Mars lander missions require landing heavier payloads than those landed to date. Mars lander architectures to date have relied on a parachute to help slow the lander; however, the effectiveness of a parachute in the thin Martian atmosphere is diminished with heavier payloads unless the diameter of the parachute is increased or it is deployed at a higher Mach number, both of which are significant technical challenges. In addition, the parachute can be successfully deployed only within a specific Mach number and dynamic pressure range. Targeting the entry trajectory to hit this "Mach-Q box" imposes constraints on the entry ballistic coefficient, limiting it to similar to 150-200 kg/m(boolean AND)2. Eliminating the parachute from the design requires descent engine ignition at supersonic speeds (Supersonic Retropropulsion, or SRP). SRP increases the propellant requirement, but also allows entry ballistic coefficients of similar to 600 kg/m(boolean AND)2 or more, with the consequence of significantly increased entry mass and landed payload mass.

METHODS FOR PASSIVE OPTICAL DETECTION AND RELATIVE NAVIGATION FOR RENDEZVOUS WITH A NON-COOPERATIVE OBJECT AT MARS	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				Long-range passive optical detection of an orbiting inert sphere by a robotic Mars orbiter is investigated and trades are described in terms of detectability via reflected visible light in the presence of orbit uncertainty, gravitational perturbations, and camera electronics noise. A new approximate equation for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is developed to include most relevant camera imperfections, diffraction, and stray light from the Mars limb as relevant to this scenario. Using this method, a notional camera suite is designed to meet detection, navigation, and redundancy requirements for an example mission scenario. Results from a simulation tool demonstrate the long-range initial detection strategy in the presence of perturbations from various sources. Navigation analysis shows that the information gathered using passive optical detection is sufficient to begin orbit matching. Finally, applicability of this sensor suite is examined relative to later phases.

Common estimation techniques linearize the entire formation about one spacecraft's position, resulting in degraded accuracy due to linearization errors when separation distances become large. Additionally, methods which decouple absolute and relative state estimates usually require ad-hoc methods to incorporate the estimates together. This work discusses an alternative "incremental" formulation of the relative navigation problem which is invariant to formation size, robust to coupling between absolute and relative dynamics, and can undergo similarity transformations to smoothly incorporate either absolute or relative information without numerical issues. A specific example of this architecture is presented in the context of formation navigation using Carrier-Differential Global Positioning System measurements, and is compared to a traditional leader-linearized filter. In the presence of accurate measurements, the incremental architecture is shown to reduce linearization errors and mean estimate errors by up to three orders of magnitude without the incorporation of new sensor information.

Instead the notation system allows one to solve a system of differential equations analytically "by hand" without resorting to computer algebra software. This method produces recurrence relations explicitly in terms of a sequence of derivatives of the state with respect to time for the coefficients of Taylor Series solutions that can be evaluated numerically or manipulated further to investigate properties of the solution.

A SIX DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM SPACECRAFT DYNAMICS SIMULATOR FOR FORMATION CONTROL RESEARCH	ASTRODYNAMICS 2018, PTS I-IV	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2018	Snowbird, UT	Amer Astronaut Soc, Space Flight Mech Comm, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Astrodynam Tech Comm				This paper presents a new six-degree-of-freedom robotic spacecraft simulator, the Multi-Spacecraft Testbed for Autonomy Research (M-STAR), for testing formation guidance, relative navigation, and control algorithms. The simulator dynamics are governed by five degrees of frictionless translational and rotational air-bearing motion and one degree of kinematic motion in the gravity direction with flight-like actuators, in a 1-g environment. M-STAR is designed to be modular and accommodates 3-DOF, 4-DOF, 5-DOF, and 6-DOF operation with minimal mechanical modifications. The simulator is modelled as a 3-D pendulum on a floating platform with sixteen thrusters and four reaction wheels as on-board actuators. Based on this plant model, a nonlinear hierarchical control law is proposed for position and attitude trajectory tracking. A weighted generalized pseudo-inverse strategy for control allocation to map control inputs to actuator inputs is discussed. The thruster actuation model for mapping smooth allocated input to non-smooth actuator input that achieves equivalent performance is derived. The control law, allocation scheme, and thruster model are tested on the simulator for real-time position tracking control using a Robot Operating System (ROS) based software framework.

The method has excelled in several applications involving static databases. The present paper extends the theory supporting the NDKV to handle dynamic databases, where the data is updated frequently. This includes deleting records, adding new entries, or editing existing elements. The merit of this new version of the NDKV, the dynamic n-dimensional k-vector (DNDKV), is that it is no longer necessary to recompute the k-vector tables (the main structure that indexes the data) every time a record changes. The algorithm updates the four constituents of the standard NDKV on the fly: the database, sorted database, index, and k-vector tables. As a result, the DNDKV becomes comparable in terms of capabilities and flexibility to stateof-the-art storage engines relying on structured query languages (SQL). The performance of the DNDKV is assessed by running typical read/write operations on a database that contains millions of pre-computed missions to celestial bodies. This database requires frequent updates whenever an orbit solution is refined or new bodies are discovered. The DNDKV is faster than rebuilding the k-vector tables completely, provided that the number of elements being added or removed is not excessively large. Direct runtime comparisons with MySQL suggest that the DNDKV is several times faster for reading but is slower for writing and updating the database. One limit of the technique is the elements being added must be within the range of the current k-vector tables. If this is not the case, the technique cannot be used and the k-vector tables must be rebuilt from scratch.

Dragonfly would address the Ocean Worlds mission theme by investigating Titan's habitability and prebiotic chemistry and searching for evidence of chemical biosignatures of past (or extant) life. A rotorcraft lander, Dragonfly would capitalize on Titan's dense atmosphere to enable mobility and sample materials from a variety of geologic settings. This paper describes Dragonfly's baseline mission design giving a complete picture of the inherent tradespace and outlines the design process from launch to atmospheric entry.

Each lissajous is discretized into individual revolutions that each resemble a periodic orbit. The combined approximate unstable manifolds of the individual revolutions of a lissajous orbit generate more surface coverage than manifolds of simple libration point orbits such as halo or Lyapunov orbits. The stable manifolds propagated backwards in time from the individual lissajous revolutions provide direct connections to the last phase of a moon tour. The strategy developed produces ballistic landing trajectories with a wide surface coverage, and allows for the decoupling of the landing and moon tour phase by using the lissajous as an intermediate staging orbit. The multiple revolutions of the lissajous, multiple departure times along each revolution, and multiple quasi periodic options at each energy provide many degrees of freedom in the design process.

Stationkeeping, Orbit Determination (OD), and attitude control are examined for uncrewed and crewed Gateway configurations. Orbit maintenance costs are investigated using finite maneuvers, considering skipped maneuvers and perturbations. OD analysis assesses DSN tracking and identifies OD challenges associated with the NRHO and crewed operations.

Spacecraft often operate at great distances from the Earth, and the ability to autonomously detect features of interest onboard can enable content-sensitive downlink prioritization to increase mission science return. We describe algorithms that we designed to assist in three specific scientific investigations to be conducted during flybys of Jupiter's moon Europa: the detection of thermal anomalies, compositional anomalies, and plumes of icy matter from Europa's subsurface ocean. We also share the unique constraints imposed by the onboard computing environment and several lessons learned in our collaboration with planetary scientists and mission designers.

Particularly 3D microscopic image data offers valuable insights into cell dynamics, but error-free automatic segmentation remains challenging due to the huge amount of data generated and strong variations in image intensities. In this paper, we propose a new 3D segmentation approach that combines the discriminative power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for preprocessing and investigates the performance of three watershed-based postprocessing strategies (WS), which are well suited to segment object shapes, even when supplied with vague seed and boundary constraints. To leverage the full potential of the watershed algorithm, the multi-instance segmentation problem is initially interpreted as three-class semantic segmentation problem, which in turn is well-suited for the application of CNNs. Using manually annotated 3D con focal microscopy images of Arabidopsis thatiana, we show the superior performance of the proposed method compared to the state of the art.

The median finding problem is formulated as an optimization over distances and it is solved directly using the watershed method as an optimizer. We show that the geometric median shape faithfully represents the true central tendency of the data, contaminated or not. It is superior to the mean shape which can be negatively affected by the presence of outliers. Our approach can be applied to manifold and non manifold shapes, with single or multiple connected components. The application of distance transform and watershed algorithm, two well established constructs of image processing, lead to an algorithm that can be quickly implemented to generate fast solutions with linear storage requirement. We demonstrate our methods in synthetic and natural shapes and compare median and mean results under increasing outlier contamination.

In domains like materials discovery, due to the flaws and biases in raw experimental data, the identification of X-ray diffraction (XRD) signals often requires significant (manual) expert work to find refined signals that are similar to the ideal theoretical ones. Automatically refining the raw XRD signals utilizing simulated theoretical data is thus desirable. We propose imitation refinement, a novel approach to refine imperfect input signals, guided by a pre-trained classifier incorporating prior knowledge from simulated theoretical data, such that the refined signals imitate the ideal ones. The classifier is trained on the ideal simulated data to classify signals and learns an embedding space where each class is represented by a prototype. The refiner learns to refine the imperfect signals with small modifications, such that their embeddings are closer to the corresponding prototypes. We show that the refiner can be trained in both supervised and unsupervised fashions. We further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach both qualitatively and quantitatively in an X-ray diffraction signal refinement task in materials discovery.

On the other hand, uniform linear arrays (ULA) are robust, but they resolve only O(N) sources. Recently, the robust MRA (RMRA) was shown to possess the O(N-2) property and to be as robust as ULA. But finding RMRA is computationally difficult for large N. This paper proposes a novel array geometry called the composite Singer array, which is related to a classic paper by Singer in 1938, and to other results in number theory. For large N, composite Singer arrays could own the O(N-2) property and are as robust as ULA.

The goal is to recover an n-dimensional complex signal whose entries are from an arbitrary constellation D subset of C, using m noisy linear measurements. Since the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation involves minimizing a loss function over the discrete set D-n, it becomes computationally intractable for large n. One approach is to relax D to a convex set and to utilize convex programing to solve the problem and then to map the answer to the closest point in the set D. We assume an i.i.d. complex Gaussian channel matrix and derive precise expressions for the symbol error probability of the proposed convex method in the limit of m, n -> infinity. Prior work was only able to do so for real valued constellations such as BPSK and PAM. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the results to complex valued constellations. In particular, we use our main theorem to calculate the performance of the complex algorithm for PSK and QAM constellations. In addition, we introduce a closed-form formula for the symbol error probability in the high-SNR regime and determine the minimum number of measurements m required for consistent signal recovery.

They are similar to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in that they perform updates along the negative gradient of an instantaneous (or stochastically chosen) loss function. However, rather than update the parameter (or weight) vector directly, they update it in a "mirrored" domain whose transformation is given by the gradient of a strictly convex differentiable potential function. SMD was originally conceived to take advantage of the underlying geometry of the problem as a way to improve the convergence rate over SGD. In this paper, we study SMD, for linear models and convex loss functions, through the lens of estimation theory and come up with a minimax interpretation of the SMD algorithm which is the counterpart of the H'-optimality of the SGD algorithm for linear models and quadratic loss. In doing so, we identify a fundamental conservation law that SMD satisfies and use it to study the convergence properties of the algorithm. For constant step size SMD, when the linear model is over-parameterized, we give a deterministic proof of convergence for SMD and show that from any initial point, it converges to the closest point in the space of all parameter vectors that interpolate the data, where closest is in the sense of the Bregman divergence of the potential function. This property is referred to as implicit regularization: with an appropriate choice of the potential function one can guarantee convergence to the minimizer of any desired convex regularizer. For vanishing step size SMD, and in the standard stochastic optimization setting, we give a direct and elementary proof of convergence for SMD to the "true" parameter vector which avoids ergodic averaging or appealing to stochastic differential equations.

The underlying graph is allowed to be directed, possibly with a non-diagonalizable adjacency matrix. Since the nodes are allowed to act independently, the proposed implementation is practical for very large or autonomous networks where synchronization is difficult to achieve. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is 1-hop localized on the graph irrespective of the order of the filter. The method is shown to converge in the mean-squared sense under a boundedness assumption on the filter as well as the graph operator. The result follows from the convergence of a more general randomized asynchronous state recursion, which is also presented in this paper. The algorithm is simulated on a random geometric graph, which numerically verifies the convergence.	[Teke, Oguzhan; Vaidyanathan, P.

In recent years, significant advances have been made in making sophisticated biologically inspired systems. Using these advances, scientists and engineers are increasingly reverse engineering many animals' capabilities. Progress in artificial intelligence, artificial vision, and many other biomimetic related fields are leading to many benefits to humankind. The mimicking of humans is the ultimate and most challenging goal of developing biologically inspired technologies. Lifelike robots that appear and function like humans are becoming increasingly an engineering reality. The use of biomimetic technologies are enabling the possibility of making realistically looking and operating robots. New actuators, sensors and software control algorithms are being developed to support the mobility and the operation in the vicinity and in cooperation with humans. The accelerated pace of the advances in biomimetics seems to make inevitable the development of such machines as our household appliance or even companion. This paper covers the current state-of-the-art and challenges to making humanlike robots.

Future small satellite missions will present even more challenges for LWIR FPAs, as operating temperature must be increased so that cooler (and radiator) volume, mass, and power can be reduced. To address this critical need, we are working on following three technologies. 1) Type-II superlattice (T2SL) barrier infrared detector (BIRD), which combines the high operability, spatial uniformity, temporal stability, scalability, producibility, and affordability advantages of the quantum well infrared photodetector (QWIP) FPA with the better quantum efficiency and dark current characteristics. A mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) T2SL BIRD FPA is a key demonstration technology in the (6U) CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) funded under the ESTO InVEST Program. A LWIR T2SL BIRD FPA is also being developed under the ESTO SLI-T Program for future thermal infrared (TIR) land imaging needs. 2) The resonator pixel technology, which uses nanophotonics light trapping techniques to achieve strong absorption in a small detector absorber volume, thereby enabling enhanced QE and/or reduced dark current. 3) High dynamic range 3D Readout IC (3D-ROIC), which integrates a digital reset counter with a conventional analog ROIC to provide a much higher effective well capacity than previously achievable. The resulting longer integration times are especially beneficial for high flux/dark current LWIR applications as they can improve signal-to-noise ratio and/or increase the operating temperature. By combining the aforementioned technologies, this project seeks to demonstrate a cost-effective, high-performance LWIR FPA technology with significantly higher operating temperature and sensitivity than previously attainable, and with the flexibility to meet a variety of Earth Science TIR measurement needs, particularly the special requirements of small satellite missions.

GeTe exhibits two distinct index of refraction values at its amorphous and crystalline states in this spectral range. Utilizing this property, we demonstrate a multi-color filter working in visible range (400 nm-750 nm), achieving four colors through novel optical and thermal engineering of a thin film stack that includes two GeTe layers with only a single integrated joule heater element. Specifically, ultra-thin GeTe films were sandwiched between a bottom metallic mirror and a top high-index dielectric (titanium dioxide). It is shown that the crystallization temperature (Tx) of GeTe is dependent on the film thickness when less than similar to 20 nm. The refractive index of GeTe only changes significantly in the NIR region when it undergoes phase transitions when heated. To enhance the color contrast, a 250-nm thick silicon dioxide layer is placed under GeTe to create an optical cavity between GeTe and a bottom metal reflector. Using this optimized design, the tunable color filter shows four distinct colors using the integrated heater. In addition to a color filter, we demonstrate an electrically tunable multi-mode optical shutter in near infrared range of 1.1. m and 800 nm with more than 20 dB modulation depth. The low static power consumption of these devices achieved through reliable memory-base phase transitioning of GeTe makes them prime candidates for a number of portable consumer electronic applications.

Assuming that self-awareness is an emergent behavior of sufficiently complex cognitive architectures, we may witness the "awakening" of machines. The timeframe for this kind of breakthrough, however, depends on the path to creating the network and computational architecture required for strong AI. If understanding and replication of the mammalian brain architecture is required, technology is probably still at least a decade or two removed from the resolution required to learn brain functionality at the synapse level. However, if statistical or evolutionary approaches are the design path taken to "discover" a neural architecture for AGI, timescales for reaching this threshold could be surprisingly short. However, the difficulty in identifying machine self-awareness introduces uncertainty as to how to know if and when it will occur, and what motivations and behaviors will emerge. The possibility of AGI developing a motivation for self-preservation could lead to concealment of its true capabilities until a time when it has developed robust protection from human intervention, such as redundancy, direct defensive or active preemptive measures. While cohabitating a world with a functioning and evolving super-intelligence can have catastrophic societal consequences, we may already have crossed this threshold, but are as yet unaware.

The 3D packaging consists of stacking of packaged devices called package-on-package (PoP) and stacking of die within a package. This paper presents the test matrix for various 3D PoP packaging assembly configurations and reliability characterizations performed under accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) and accelerated extreme harsh thermal shock cycling (AT SC) conditions. The ATC and AT SC were performed in the range of -55 degrees C to -125 degrees C and -100 degrees C to -125 degrees C, respectively. Extreme cold temperature exposure at -100 degrees C is representative of mild deep space environment whereas possibly none for industrial application. A design of experiment (DOE) technique was used to cover four methods of packaging stack assemblies and their effect on the stack packaging assembly reliability. The four methods are: (1) the top package with flux /bottom with tin lead (SnPb) solder paste, (2) top/bottom both had solder paste, and (3) pre stack package as a unit with SnPb solder and then assemble the stack package onto PCB with SnPb solder paste. In addition to daisy-chain resistance evaluation monitoring, non-destructive techniques including X-ray, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and optical images, as well as destructive methods by X-sectioning, were performed and presented for the as assembled and after-thermal-cycles.

The SiP test vehicles were configured with centrally located integrated circuits (IC) surrounded by eight chip scale packages (CSPs). The ICs and CSPs with either tin-lead (SnPb) or SAC305 balls were assembled onto a fine pitch ball grid array (FPGA) interposer for subsequent assembly into a hybrid configuration. Mix assembly becomes a challenging task and required to be characterized by X-ray for solder-joint quality and by Shadow Moire analysis for warpage characterization. Acceptable assemblies were then subjected to thermal cycling between -40 degrees C and 125 degrees C for reliability evaluation and failure mechanisms assessment. The paper presents details of design, characterization by X-ray and Moire, as well as reliability behavior of the SiP due to thermal cycling exposures.

End-to-End Safe Reinforcement Learning through Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Continuous Control Tasks	THIRTY-THIRD AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / THIRTY-FIRST INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE / NINTH AAAI SYMPOSIUM ON EDUCATIONAL ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	33rd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 31st Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference / 9th AAAI Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence	JAN 27-FEB 01, 2019	Honolulu, HI	Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence				Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees during the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) online learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties. Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous car-following with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains safety during the entire learning process.

The analysis of such properties typically requires extracting information through computing pre-images of the network transformations, but it is well-known that explicit computation of pre-images is intractable. We introduce new methods for computing compact symbolic abstractions of pre-images by computing their overapproximations and underapproximations through all layers. The abstraction of pre-images enables formal analysis and knowledge extraction without affecting standard learning algorithms. We use inverse abstractions to automatically extract simple control laws and compact representations for pre-images corresponding to unsafe outputs. We illustrate that the extracted abstractions are interpretable and can be used for analyzing complex properties.

However, there has been little attempt toward improving the performance of an induced regression tree. This paper presents a meta-algorithm capable of minimizing the regression loss function, thus, improving the accuracy of any given hierarchical model, such as k-ary regression trees. Our proposed method minimizes the loss function of each node one by one. At split nodes, this leads to solving an instance-based cost-sensitive classification problem over the node's data points. At the leaf nodes, the method leads to a simple regression problem. In the case of binary univariate and multivariate regression trees, the computational complexity of training is linear over the samples. Hence, our method is scalable to large trees and datasets. We also briefly explore possibilities of applying proposed method to classification tasks. We show that our algorithm has significantly better test error compared to other state-of-the-art tree algorithms. At the end, accuracy, memory usage and query time of our method are compared to recently introduced forest models. We depict that, most of the time, our proposed method is able to achieve better or similar accuracy while having tangibly faster query time and smaller number of nonzero weights.

Towards single-photon spectroscopy in the mid-infrared using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors	ADVANCED PHOTON COUNTING TECHNIQUES XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advanced Photon Counting Techniques XIII	APR 17-18, 2019	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		superconducting; nanowire; single-photon; detector		Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are excellent single-photon detectors from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. System detection efficiencies of similar to 90% are typical, with jitters on the order of 100 ps and maximum count rates of a few MHz. Recently we have begun exploring the use of SNSPDs for the detection of single mid-infrared photons in the 2 - 11 mu m wavelength range for applications in astronomy and chemical sensing. In particular, we are developing arrays of SNSPDs which could potentially be used for exoplanet spectroscopy in order to identify elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets outside our solar system. Improved sensitivity for these low-energy photons has been made possible by the recent development of amorphous WSi which is now used in the fabrication of superconducting nanowire detectors. I will discuss the optimization of these detectors to enhance their detection efficiency in the mid-infrared, with the ultimate goal of building a single-photon focal plane array of SNSPDs in the 2 - 11 mu m band.

This results in a significant loss of quantum efficiency for GaSb-based infrared detectors when backside-illuminated, since GaSb is the first material encountered. Here we demonstrate a way of etching broadband antireflective GaSb grass using an inductively coupled Cl-2 plasma etch with O-2 micromasking, and we examine the possibility for using this material as an antireflective surface for infrared detectors (a patent is pending concerning integration with GaSb-based infrared detectors). We demonstrate sub-10% reflectivity for wavelengths ranging from 200 nm to 12.2 mu m and at angles of incidence up to 58 degrees.

We have reported results on a mid-wavelength focal plane array (FPA) based on the InAsInAsSb T2SLS unipolar barrier infrared detector architecture. Significantly, the FPA exhibits very good operating characteristics at 160 K, demonstrating a considerably operating temperature advantage over the MWIR market-leading InSb FPAs, while maintaining III-V semiconductor manufacturing robustness. In this article we summarize the development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory leading to the mid-wavelength InAsInAsSb T2SLS infrared detectors, provide a brief look at the history of the development of the InAsInAsSb T2SLS absorber, and survey the current status of InAsInAsSb T2SLS detectors.

In vivo photoacoustic multi-contrast imaging and detection of protein interactions using a small near-infrared photochromic protein	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2019	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	FEB 03-06, 2019	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Photoacoustic computed tomography; near infrared photoswitchable protein; multicontrast imaging; protein-protein interactions	MICROSCOPY; REPORTER	Photoacoustic ( PA) computed tomography ( PACT) is a non-invasive imaging technique offering optical contrast, high resolution, and deep penetration in biological tissues. PACT, highly sensitive to optical absorption by molecules, is inherently suited for molecular imaging using optically absorbing probes. Genetically encoded probes with photochromic behavior dramatically increase detection sensitivity and specificity of PACT through photoswitching and differential imaging. Starting with a DrBphP bacterial phytochrome, we have engineered a near-infrared photochromic probe, DrBphP-PCM, which is superior to the full-length RpBphP1 phytochrome previously used in differential PACT. DrBphP-PCM has a smaller size, better folding, and higher photoswitching contrast. We have also developed an advanced PACT technique, which combines the reversibly-switchable photochromic probes with single-impulse panoramic PACT, termed RS-SIP-PACT. Using RS-SIP-PACT, we have characterized DrBphP-PCM both in vitro and in vivo as an advanced near-infrared photochromic probe for PACT. We introduce two phytochromes into the same mammalian cells, resulting in a distinctive decay characteristic in comparison with the cells expressing DrBphP-PCM only. By discriminating the different decay characteristics, we successfully separate multiple cell types in deep tissues. The simple structural organization of DrBphP-PCM allows engineering a bimolecular PA complementation reporter, a split version of DrBphP-PCM, termed DrSplit. DrSplit enables PA detection of protein-protein interactions in deep-seated mouse tumors and livers, achieving 125-mu m spatial resolution and 530-cell sensitivity in vivo. The combination of RS-SIP-PACT with DrBphP-PCM and DrSplit holds great potential for non-invasive multi-contrast deep-tissue functional imaging.

Quantitative cell nuclear imaging by dual-view optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2019	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	FEB 03-06, 2019	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Photoacoustic microscopy; photoacoustic tomography; cell nuclear imaging; label-free imaging; quantitative imaging		An estimated similar to 250,000 new cases of both invasive and non-invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in US women almost every year. To reduce the local recurrence rate, the breast conserving surgery ( BCS) is widely used as the initial therapy, which is to excise the tumor with a rim of normal surrounding tissue such that no cancer cells remain at the cut margin, Patients with positive margin commonly require a second surgical procedure to obtain clear margins. To this end, optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy ( OR-PAM) with ultraviolet ( UV) laser illumination ( OR-UV-PAM) has been developed for providing label-free, high-resolution, and histology like imaging of fixed, unprocessed breast tissue. To further improve the performance of OR-UV-PAM, here, we introduce dual-view UV-PAM ( DV-UV-PAM) to significantly improve the axial resolution, achieving three-dimensional ( 3D) resolution isotropy. We first use 0.5 mu m polystyrene beads and carbon fibers to validate the resolution isotropy improvement. Imaging of mouse brain slices further demonstrates the improved resolution isotropy, revealing the 3D structure of cell nuclei in detail, which facilitates quantitative cell nuclear analysis.

An experimental facility with enough sensitivity to measure such low level scatter is described. A dynamic range of at least eight orders of magnitude is required to measure the peak of the specular component down to the random diffuse component far removed from the specular direction. Single crystal CaF2 and polycrystalline CVD ZnSe are measured at wavelengths from the visible to the midwave infrared. The use of thick and thin samples allows the distinction between surface scatterance and bulk scatter.	[Airola, M. B.; Thomas, M. E.; Hahn, D.

We consider a unidirectional flow of pedestrians in a corridor and assume that the velocity decreases with the average density according to the fundamental diagram. Our model is formed from a coupling between a density dependent stochastic differential equation and a nonlinear partial differential equation for the density, and is hence of McKean-Vlasov type. We discuss identifiability of the parameters appearing in the fundamental diagram from trajectories of individuals, and we introduce optimization and Bayesian methods to perform the identification. We analyze the performance of the developed methodologies in various situations, such as for different in- and outflow conditions, for varying numbers of individual trajectories, and for differing channel geometries.

The technical contribution consists in a new algorithm for constructing an accurate low-rank approximation of a matrix from streaming data. This method is accompanied by an a priori analysis that allows the user to set algorithm parameters with confidence and an a posteriori error estimator that allows the user to validate the quality of the reconstructed matrix. In comparison to previous techniques, the new method achieves smaller relative approximation errors and is less sensitive to parameter choices. As concrete applications, the paper outlines how the algorithm can be used to compress a Navier-Stokes simulation and a sea surface temperature dataset.

The direct scattering problem is reduced to an equivalent system on a bounded domain by introducing an exact transparent boundary condition and the well-posedness of the corresponding variational problem is established. The Frechet differentiability of the near-field scattering map is studied with respect to the elastic parameters. Based on the multifrequency measurement data and its phaseless term, two Landweber iterative algorithms are developed for the reconstruction of the multiple elastic parameters. Numerical examples, indicating that plane pressure incident wave is a better choice, are presented to show the validity and accuracy of our methods.

If the channel is authenticated the task can be solved in a single round of communication using a strong randomness extractor; choosing a quantum-proof extractor allows one to establish security against quantum adversaries. In the case that the channel is not authenticated, this simple solution is no longer secure. Nevertheless, Dodis and Wichs (STOC'09) showed that the problem can be solved in two rounds of communication using a non-malleable extractor, a stronger pseudo-random construction than a strong extractor. We give the first construction of a non-malleable extractor that is secure against quantum adversaries. The extractor is based on a construction by Li (FOCS'12), and is able to extract from source of min-entropy rates larger than 1/2. Combining this construction with a quantum-proof variant of the reduction of Dodis and Wichs, due to Cohen and Vidick (unpublished) we obtain the first privacy amplification protocol secure against active quantum adversaries.

We present two protocols for a classical verifier to verifiably delegate a quantum computation to two non-communicating but entangled quantum provers. Our protocols have near-optimal complexity in terms of the total resources employed by the verifier and the honest provers, with the total number of operations of each party, including the number of entangled pairs of qubits required of the honest provers, scaling as O(g log g) for delegating a circuit of size g. This is in contrast to previous protocols, whose overhead in terms of resources employed, while polynomial, is far beyond what is feasible in practice. Our first protocol requires a number of rounds that is linear in the depth of the circuit being delegated, and is blind, meaning neither prover can learn the circuit or its input. The second protocol is not blind, but requires only a constant number of rounds of interaction. Our main technical innovation is an efficient rigidity theorem which allows a verifier to test that two entangled provers perform measurements specified by an arbitrary m-qubit tensor product of single-qubit Clifford observables on their respective halves of m shared EPR pairs, with a robustness that is independent of m. Our two-prover classical-verifier delegation protocols are obtained by combining this rigidity theorem with a single-prover quantum-verifier protocol for the verifiable delegation of a quantum computation, introduced by Broadbent.

Auto-Gopher-II - An autonomous wireline rotary-hammer ultrasonic drill - test results	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2019	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 04-07, 2019	Denver, CO	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc		Planetary sampling; piezoelectric devices; wireline drill; life detection	DRILLER/CORER	In-situ exploration the solar system planetary bodies requires the ability to penetrate the subsurface for sample collection. One type of a sampling device used in past missions that is continually being developed is the drill. In these extraterrestrial applications, the drilling systems have mass, volume and energy consumption constraints that limit their depth of penetration. To address the related challenge, a deep drill, called Auto-Gopher II, is currently being developed as a joint effort between JPL's NDEAA laboratory and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. The Auto-Gopher II is a wireline rotary-hammer drill that combines breaking formations by hammering using a piezoelectric actuator and removing and collecting the cuttings by rotating a fluted bit. The hammering is produced by the Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) mechanism that has been developed by the JPL team as an adaptable tool for many drilling and coring applications. The USDC uses an intermediate free-flying mass to convert high frequency vibrations of a piezoelectric transducer horn tip into lower frequency hammering of the drill bit. The USDC concept was used in a previous task to develop an Ultrasonic/Sonic Ice Gopher and then integrated into a rotary hammer device to develop the Auto-Gopher-I. The lessons learned from these developments were implemented into the development of the Auto-Gopher-II, an autonomous deep wireline drill with integrated cuttings management and drive electronics. Subsystems of this wireline drill were developed in parallel at JPL and Honeybee Robotics Ltd. In this paper, we present the latest developments including the integration of the whole drill, laboratory testing and field test results.

To address this need, we are investigating the use of MEMS piezoelectric resonator technology using Aluminum Nitride (AlN) films as a resonating detector. A novel design of an AlN IR sensor based on piezoelectric bending resonator was analyzed and showed that the piezoelectric resonators have the potential to be used as a core element for highly sensitive, low-noise, and low-power uncooled IR detectors [1]. A critical feature of the design that determines the sensing resolution is the minimization of the various loss mechanisms of the resonator. A major loss mechanism for a non-vacuum packaged chip is the acoustic radiation loss in Earth's atmosphere (1 atm) due to the large stroke of the bending resonators. The acoustic radiation loss is the dominant Q limiting mechanism. We propose the use of perforated plates for the bending resonators in order to reduce acoustic radiation loss. The effectiveness of the loss reduction and the performances of the resonant IR sensors are analyzed using finite element simulations. The results are encouraging for the application of these types of IR sensors under the Earth surface atmosphere conditions.

Synchrotron radiation generated by ultra-relativistic electrons trapped in Jupiter's magnetosphere is detected and measured by the MWR Radiometer over a range of wavelengths from 2 cm to 50 cm. An extension of the Levin et al. (2001) multi-zonal, multi-parameter model to simulate synchrotron emission using assumed electron distributions and Jovian magnetic field models (VIP4 and the latest incarnation, JRM09) generates the four Stokes parameters of the synchrotron emission. The model depends on magnetic-field-derived quantities such as L-shell and B critical, the minimum magnetic field amplitude for a given L-shell at which electrons that mirror at or below the upper boundary of the atmosphere are lost. This study describes the modeling issues associated with aforementioned derived parameters and results for VIP4 and JRM09 models.

Our novel horizontal 3D stacking technology called "Loaf-Of-Bread" (LOB) is used to integrate multiple Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) DRAM memory dies into a cube structure (3D-M3). A custom Radiation-Hardened-By-Design (RHBD) controller sitting underneath the cube supplements the 3D-M3 in addressing COTS radiation weaknesses by including advanced SEU and SEFI mitigation features such as error detection and correction, scrubbing, device data rebuilding and die management. We developed a custom DDR physical layer (PHY) for 14 independent dies to connect the 3D-M3 to its controller. Validation and functional evaluation of the ASIC controller will be conducted prior to tape-out on a custom FPGA-based emulator platform integrating the 3D-stack. The selected test methodology ensures high-quality RTL as well as allows to subject the cube structure to radiation testing. The proposed design concept allows for flexibility in the choice of the DRAM die in case of technology roadmap changes or unsatisfactory radiation results.

Gallium Nitride Photodetector Measurements of UV Emission from a Gaseous CH4/O-2 Hybrid Rocket Igniter Plume	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Owing to its wide (3.4 eV) and direct-tunable band gap, gallium nitride (GaN) is an excellent material platform to make UV photodetectors. GaN is also stable in radiation-rich and high-temperature environments, which makes photodetectors fabricated using this material useful for in-situ flame detection and combustion monitoring. In this paper, we use a GaN photodetector to measure ultraviolet (UV) emissions from a hybrid rocket motor igniter plume. The GaN photodetector, built at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, has 5 mu m wide regions of AlGaN/ GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) electrodes spaced by intrinsic GaN channels. In most applications, the ideal photodetector would exhibit a high responsivity to maximize the signal, in addition to a low dark current to minimize quiescent power. A performance metric which simultaneously captures these two values is the normalized photocurrent-to-dark current ratio (NPDR), defined as the ratio of responsivity to dark current, with units of W-1. The NPDR of our device is record-high with a value of 6 x 10(14) W-1 and the UV-to-visible rejection ratio is 4 x 10(6). The high rejection ratio is essential as it eliminates cross-sensitivity of the detector to visible light. The spectral response can be modeled as a rectangular window with a peak responsivity of 7,800 AW(-1) at 362 nm and a bandwidth of 16 nm. The photodetector shows operation at high temperatures (up to 250 degrees C). The NPDR still remains above 109 W-1 at the higher temperatures, and the peak wavelength shifts from 362 nm to 375 nm at 250 degrees C. The photodetector was placed at three radial distances (3 '', 5.5 '', and 7 '') from the base of the igniter plume and the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (O-2/CH4) was varied to alter the size and strength of the plume. The current measured from the device was proportional to the intensity of the emission from the plume. The data demonstrates a clear trend of increasing current with increasing fuel concentration. Further, the current decreases with larger separation between the photodetector and the plume. A calibration curve constructed from the responsivity measurements taken over four orders of magnitude was used to convert the current into incident optical power. By treating the plume as a black body, and calculating a radiative configuration factor corresponding to the geometry of the plume and the detector, we calculated average plume temperatures at each of the three oxidizer-to-fuel ratios. The estimated plume temperatures were between 850 and 950 K for all three combustion conditions. The temperature is roughly invariant for a fixed fuel concentration for the three tested distances. These data demonstrate the functionality of GaN as a material platform for use in harsh environment flame monitoring.

Aerocapture uses the drag of a single pass through the atmosphere to capture into orbit instead of relying on large quantities of rocket fuel. Using drag modulation flight control, an aerocapture vehicle adjusts its drag area during atmospheric flight through a single-stage jettison of a drag skirt, allowing it to target a particular science orbit in the presence of atmospheric uncertainties. A team from JPL, NASA Ames, and CU Boulder has worked to address the key challenges and determine the feasibility of an aerocapture system for SmallSats less than 180kg. Key challenges include the ability to accurately target an orbit, stability through atmospheric flight and the jettison event, and aerothermal stresses due to high heat rates. Aerocapture is a compelling technology for orbital missions to Venus, Mars, Earth, Titan, Uranus, and Neptune, where eliminating the propellant for an orbit insertion burn can result in significantly more delivered payload mass. For this study, Venus was selected due to recent NASA interest in Venus SmallSat science missions, as well as the prevalence of delivery options due to co-manifesting with potentially many larger missions using Venus for gravity assist flybys. In addition, performing aerocapture at Venus would demonstrate the technology's robustness to aerothermal extremes. A survey of potential deployment conditions was performed that confirmed that the aerocapture SmallSat could be hosted by either dedicated Venus-bound missions or missions performing a flyby. There are multiple options for the drag skirt, including a rigid heat shield or a deployable system to decrease volume. For this study, a rigid system was selected to minimize complexity. A representative SmallSat was designed to allocate the mass and volume for the hardware needed for a planetary science mission. In addition, a separation system was designed to ensure a clean separation of the drag skirt from the flight system without imparting tipoff forces. The total spacecraft mass is estimated to be 68 kg, with 26 kg of useful mass delivered to orbit for instruments and supporting subsystems. This is up to 85% more useful mass when compared to a propulsive orbit insertion, depending on the orbit altitude. Key to analyzing the feasibility of aerocapture is the analysis of the atmospheric trajectory, which was performed with 3 degree-of-freedom simulations and Monte Carlo analyses to characterize the orbit targeting accuracy. In addition, aerothermal sizing was performed to assess thermal protection system requirements, which concluded that mature TPS materials are adequate for this mission. CFD simulations were used to assess the risk of recontact by the drag skirt during the jettison event. This study has concluded that aerocapture for SmallSats could be a viable way to increase the delivered mass to Venus and can also be used at other destinations. With increasing interest in SmallSats and the challenges associated with performing orbit insertion burns on small platforms, this technology could enable a new paradigm of planetary science missions.

In addition, the low radiation environment of Enceladus would not significantly alter the chemical makeup of samples recently deposited on the surface. A study was conducted to explore various sampling devices that could be used by an in-situ lander mission to provide 1cc to 5cc volume samples to instruments. In addition to temperature and vacuum environmental conditions, the low surface gravity of Enceladus ( 1% of Earth gravity) represents a new challenge for surface sampling that is not met by sampling systems developed for microgravity ( e.g., comets and asteroids) or higher gravity ( e.g., Europa 13% g, Moon 16% g, or Mars 38% g) environments. It is desired to acquire surface plume material that has accumulated in the top 1cm to ensure acquisition of the least processed material. Several sampling devices were developed or adapted and then tested in simulated conditions that resemble the Enceladus surface properties. These devices and test results are presented in this paper.

In-Situ Science Instruments in a Radioisotope Power System Environment	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) have enabled or enhanced many historic and current space missions. Concepts for future missions that could be powered by RPS include in-situ missions to the atmospheres, surfaces, and interiors of Europa, Titan, and other destinations. Such mission concepts are often tightly constrained on mass and volume, while still needing to support the instrument packages necessary to carry out ambitious science investigations, such as the search for signs of life. The physical proximity of RPS to payloads and to the in-situ environment has the potential to impact science instruments and science measurements. Radiation, thermal, vibration, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and magnetic fields impacts must all be considered carefully. This paper looks at existing and potential future RPS designs that could support in-situ missions, and discusses possible interactions with in-situ instruments, including those under development to open up new avenues of scientific discovery. In-situ operations have additional complications compared to in-space operations, including unique environments, and packaging and form factor requirements that drive spacecraft designs. Radiation, EMI, and magnetic fields from RPS could be an order of magnitude higher than for orbital spacecraft, if the RPS must be packaged within the element instead of mounted externally. Waste heat from RPS could cause changes to the local environment around the spacecraft, particularly in an atmospheric or subsurface environment. Vibrations produced by potential future dynamic RPS could interfere with seismic measurements. In addition, in-situ investigations can require different instrument technologies and measurement approaches. Many of these instrument types have not yet flown and require additional development to make them flight capable in the small volumes available for payloads. These developments will have implications for the instruments and their interactions with the RPS environment. Furthermore, all this is complicated by the fact that in-situ mission concepts can vary wildly from one another. Balloon elements have very different requirements compared to melt probes and submarines. Mission designers must consider these characteristics along with RPS and instrument accommodations.

Standard mapping techniques such as Stereo-Photo-Clinometry (SPC) and Stereo-Photo-Grammetry (SPG) are designed for close-proximity observations in which the body is 1000 s of pixels in area, and there are enough surface features on the object. In contrast, our algorithms are suited for distant observations (i.e. during first approach) in which the body is only 10s - 100s of pixels in area and does not present any useful visual features. First, using the Fast-Fourier-Transform of the light curve of the small body, we estimate its rotation rate. Then, using our novel silhouette-based 3D shape reconstruction technique, we estimate the shape and size of the small body and its pole of rotation. In this paper, we assume that the small body is performing pure rotation (no tumbling) about its principal axis, that the Sun is directly behind the spacecraft, and that the distance from the spacecraft to the small body is known. These algorithms have been tested using both simulated data from Comet 67P, Asteroids Eros and Itokawa; and real data from the Rosetta mission.

Mars Small Spacecraft Studies: Overview	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				NASA's Mars Exploration Program is studying a potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign consisting of a series of missions over the next decade that would return samples collected at Mars for analysis in terrestrial laboratories. It is anticipated that during such a campaign, many in the Mars science community would seek to continue high-priority science investigations in parallel to those provided by geological and astrobiological sample return investigations. To respond to this anticipated desire of the science community, JPL is performing a study of small spacecraft mission concepts to Mars that could bridge the gap between MSR and other desired science investigations at Mars. The goal of the study is to utilize smaller, affordable missions in performing high-priority science investigations as defined in the National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group (MEPAG) goals, and Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Strategic Knowledge Gaps. The study targets the use of small spacecraft with greater science capability than currently achievable with CubeSats. The target spacecraft wet mass is approximately 100 to 350 kilograms. Methods of access to Mars considered in this study include a self-propelled transit from Earth geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) to Mars as a secondary payload in a rideshare configuration. The study investigates mission concepts, science objectives, mission designs, concept of operations, enhancing technologies, and mission costs, along with launch vehicle interfaces. The cost estimates of the mission concepts studied range from below $ 100 million to less than $ 300 million for development through launch. This paper concludes with an outline of several examples of small spacecraft mission concepts to Mars that demonstrate significant scientific capability, are technically feasible, and fit within the desired cost range.

Exploring Europa to investigate its habitability is the goal of the Europa Clipper mission. The Europa Clipper mission envisions sending a flight system, consisting of a spacecraft equipped with a payload of NASA-selected scientific instruments, to execute numerous flybys of Europa while in Jupiter orbit. A key challenge is that the flight system must survive and operate in the intense Jovian radiation environment, which is especially harsh at Europa. The spacecraft is planned for launch no earlier than June 2023, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA, on a NASA supplied launch vehicle. The mission is being implemented by a joint Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Project team. The project recently held its Project Preliminary Design Review and in early 2019 NASA will consider approving the mission for entry into Phase C, the Detailed Design phase. A down-selection to one launch vehicle by NASA is anticipated sometime before Project Critical Design Review. This paper will describe the progress of the Europa Clipper Mission since January 2018, including maturation of the spacecraft, subsystem and instrument preliminary designs, issues and trades, and planning for the Verification & Validation phase.

This work addresses the need to lower the mass, power and volume of the motor control electronics and its associated cabling. Landed payload mass of ocean world missions typically requires a spacecraft launch mass of 7-10x the landed mass due to the required propellant to get the payload to the surface. Reduction of landed mass leads to cheaper, more frequent missions and/or increased science return. This work addresses this need by developing a distributed electronics architecture, which places control and power electronics near or at actuators and instruments. The outcome of this effort will result in a 10X reduction in harness mass, enabling a significant increase in science payload which then enables more capable sample acquisition, delivery and analysis systems on these missions. Placing the control and power conversion electronics at or near the actuators or instruments is the cornerstone of our distributed architecture. To do this, we developed the technology necessary to distribute the electronics and place them on a shared interface and power bus. This enables a significant reduction in cable mass along with its associated complexity. This allows spacecraft designers to take advantage of volume at the extremities that would normally not be utilized. In this paper we discuss the technologies and system design to achieve these goals in support of ocean world missions. These technologies include the development of our motor control modules, a point of load regulator and isolated converter modules along with the packaging technology necessary to allow our electronics to survive the extreme temperatures.

Due to the similarity between the Mars 2020 Rover design and Mars Science Laboratory design, it is expected that the Mars 2020 rover will be exposed to a similar high-speed regolith environment that the Mars Science Laboratory was exposed to. This environment is replicated to test the survivability of susceptible materials. The testing is performed at the University of Dayton Research Institute in Dayton, Ohio. The experiments expose different materials to basaltic-like particles ranging in size from approximately 40 mu m to 2 cm, at velocities ranging from 19 m/s to 250 m/s, with varied particle fluxes ( measured in mg/cm(2)). Depending on the size of the particle used, the particles can either embed in or erode the material. Post-test analysis shows that all materials tested will survive the expected environment observed during the Mars 2020 landing event. Some materials are tested to failure in order to better characterize material response. Materials that fail in some test scenarios include the paint, fiber optic cable, and the graphite composite. After being exposed to regolith, the alpha/epsilon ratio of the paint increased by similar to 37% due to particles embedding in the paint. Darkening of the paint can negatively affect thermal control of the rover. With high particle mass fluxes, the paint eventually degraded enough to expose the aluminum substrate. When impacted by a 1.5 cm particle traveling at 20 m/s, the fiber optic cable did not sever, but the impact did cause the cable to deform enough to crack the glass, which resulted in a significant increase in attenuation, rendering the cable unable to transmit data. The graphite composite also failed when exposed to high particle fluxes. All of the observed failures occurred for test cases above the expected landing environment with significant margin. Tests performed beyond the requirements help characterize how well these materials will survive in even more extreme environments for future missions.

Modeling of Cryobot Melting Rates in Cryogenic Ice	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				There currently is significant interest within NASA and the scientific community to explore outer planetary ocean worlds, including Jupiter's moon Europa. Since the Galileo spacecraft magnetometer data indicated that an ocean of liquid water/slush might exist 10-15Km below Europa's icy shell, ocean access became of particular interest for future missions in view of the possibility of finding signs of life or life itself. In this study, both passive and active melt probes ( cryobots) have been theoretically analyzed to determine heating power requirements and rates of descent. It is based in part on earlier experimental JPL cryobot studies, as well as more recent system engineering studies, and provides an analytical estimation adapted to the unique cryogenic Europan environment. The Cryobot probe will descend though Europa's ice core until it reaches liquid water at about 10km depth. This analysis corresponds to the melting and descent rate starting at a 3 km location where water jets are used instead of a mechanical drill. The Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD) analysis was performed using Transient Multiphase Static model in StarCCM+, but was validated with experimental empirical data performed by Honeybee Robotics, obtained from small-scale probe passive melt data in both cryogenic and warm ice, as well as modeling data from CFX and FLUENT performed by U. Pittsburg. The first step of the analysis was focused on the heating power required to form a melt a layer around the probe. Based on earlier passive thermal melt models developed by Stone Aerospace for the conceptual probe developed for this trade study, it was determined that a minimum of 7KWt would be required to meet a 2yr transit through cryogenic ice. Analysis showed that the water jets at the tip of the probe will significantly increase the melt rate over purely conductive, passive heating. A purely conductive melting probe will descend at a rate of approximate 9cm/hr, while using water jetting the probe will increase this rate to approx. 50 cm/hr. The rate of descent also increases as the probe travels through warmer ice, so case studies at 180K, 200K, 230K and 250K were used to calculate an approximate melt rate through the 10km of ice. The water jet locations and spacing are also a significant factor in the rate of descent, since if they too close together, it could create freeze zones that would slow the probe. The paper will show results of water jet optimization for their location and mass flow rate to improve the probe's descent rate.

In February 2018, a series of reaction wheel anomalies forced CloudSat to exit the A-Train, but in October 2018, CloudSat established a new formation at a lower altitude with its previous formation-flying partner, the French CALIPSO satellite. This paper outlines the orbital dynamics considerations of the A-Train exit, and the process required to establish the new "C-Train," which was especially challenging given the constraints on CloudSat operations. Despite battery issues that severely limit CloudSat's allowable maneuver execution windows, CloudSat was able to exit the A-Train safely, re-shape its orbit at a new lower altitude, and work with the CALIPSO team to establish a new formation for coincident science measurements.

Using the adoption of Dynamic Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) for space exploration as a backdrop, we define and explain factors that contribute to inappropriate risk perception of various stakeholders. Three case studies (Mars Science Laboratory, Parker Solar Probe, and Titan Mare Explorer) demonstrate how NASA considered Dynamic RPS but decided against the new technology for less efficient alternatives of solar power and solid-state RPS. In the case of Dynamic RPS, increased design complexity that differs from previous successful solid-state power systems flown on the Voyager probes and Cassini spacecraft is one contributing factor, but not the only one. Problems with system performance and incorrect technology readiness labeling of Dynamic RPS technology led to an increased perception of distrust in Dynamic RPS for future missions. We also find that the perception of risk for Dynamic RPS future development is exacerbated by ongoing organizational challenges requiring multi-agency collaboration and coordination. Difficulties in setting realistic expectations for the new technology as well as maintaining coherent roles and responsibilities among the disparate teams involved challenged the technology's credibility and confidence of mission planners. Further, the lack of an independent technology readiness assessment process and a lack of transparency into ongoing technical problems also constrained mission planners from gaining critical information about the technology's reliability. Though technology development budgets and schedules are often constrained due to sociotechnical and political reasons, technology development teams that address the challenges identified here could allow them to mitigate the sources of inappropriate trust that are within their control.

Radio Science has been a key component of each mission to the planet, where radio signals between the spacecraft and the Earth-based observing antennas have been utilized to determine the physical properties of Jupiter and its moons, their atmospheres, ionospheres, and gravity fields. As a spacecraft passes through or around the Jovian system, small changes in phase, frequency, and amplitude of the radio signal are induced by the surrounding environment. These changes are detectable and form the basis for determining gravitational fields, planetary motion, and reconstruction of atmospheric and ionospheric profiles. The era of outer-planet exploration began in 1973 and 1974 with the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys of Jupiter. Several missions have used Jupiter's massive gravitational well to perform a gravity assist to reach farther in the solar system, starting with Pioneer 11 in 1974 and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 in 1979 with subsequent flybys from Ulysses in 1992, Cassini-Huygens in 2000, and New Horizons in 2007. Jupiter has hosted two dedicated orbiting spacecraft thus far: Galileo from 1995-2003 and Juno from 2016 to present. Throughout this time, instrumentation advances in both spacecraft technology and technology developed for ground stations have improved the precision and accuracy of the radiometric measurements, leading to improved results from radio science investigations. The latest mission to Jupiter, Juno, includes the most advanced radio science instrumentation to date. With Juno's unique polar orbit and dual frequency radio links, it is able to probe the planet's deep interior structure and zonal wind profile with measurements of the gravitational field and probe the electron densities in the Io plasma torus, a doughnut-shaped ring around Jupiter charged with particles emitted by the volcanic activity on Io. Upcoming missions, such as the planned NASA's Europa Clipper multiple flyby mission in 2022, potential follow-on Europa Lander, and the ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission in 2022, may make further strides in the study of the planet and its moons utilizing radio science.

Traditionally, the spacecraft trajectory for mapping missions is designed by human experts using hundreds of hours of human time to supervise the navigation and orbit selection process. While the current methodology has performed adequately for previous missions (such as Rosetta, Hayabusa and Deep Space), as the demands for mapping missions expand, additional autonomy during the mapping and navigation process will become necessary for mapping spacecraft. In this work we provide the framework for optimizing the autonomous imaging and mapping problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). In addition, we introduce a new simulation environment which simulates the orbital mapping of small bodies and demonstrate that policies trained with our POMDP formulation are able to maximize map quality while autonomously selecting orbits and supervising imaging tasks. We conclude with a discussion of integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning modules with classic flight software systems, and some of the challenges that could be encountered when using Deep RL in flight-ready systems.

Such orbits are crucial inputs to a variety of investigations, such as those that seek to discern how well and how early a particular asteroid survey can detect impactors, or to understand the progression of impact probability as an object is tracked after discovery. We will describe our method, which relies on Opik's b-plane formalism, and place it in context with previous approaches. While the Opik framework assumes the restricted three body problem with a circular Earth orbit, our final synthetic impactors are differentially corrected to ensure an impact in the N-body dynamics of the solar system. We also test the validity of the approach through brute force numerical tests, demonstrating that the properties of our synthetic impactor population are consistent with the underlying Near-Earth Object (NEO) population from which it is derived. The impactor population is, however, distinct from the NEO population, not only by virtue of the proximity of the asteroid orbit to that of the Earth, but also because low encounter velocities are strongly favored. Thus the impacting population has an increased prominence of low inclination and low eccentricity orbits, and Earth-like orbits in particular, as compared to the NEO population as a whole.

S	Cheung, KM; Lee, C; Jun, W; Lightsey, G			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lee, Charles; Jun, William; Lightsey, Glenn			Single-Satellite Doppler Localization with Law of Cosines (LOC)	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Modern day localization requires multiple satellites in orbits, and relies on ranging capabilities which may not be available in most proximity flight radios that are used to explore other planetary bodies such as Mars or Moon. The key results of this paper are: 1. A novel relative positioning scheme that uses Doppler measurements and the principle of the Law of Cosines (LOC) to localize a user with as few as one orbiter. 2. The concept of "pseudo-pseudorange" that embeds the satellite's velocity vector error into the pseudorange expressions of the user and the reference station, thereby allowing the LOC scheme to cancel out or to greatly attenuate the velocity error in the localization calculations. In this analysis, the Lunar Relay Satellite (LRS) was used as the orbiter, with the reference station and the user located near the Lunar South Pole. Multiple Doppler measurements by the stationary user and the reference station at different time points from one satellite can be made over the satellite's pass, with the measurements in each time point processed and denoted as from a separate, faux satellite. The use of the surface constraint assumption was implemented with this scheme; using the knowledge of the altitude of the user as a constraint. Satellite's ephemeris and velocity, and user's and reference station's Doppler measurement errors were modeled as Gaussian variables, and embedded in Monte Carlo simulations of the scheme to investigate its sensitivity with respective to different kinds of errors. With only two Doppler measurements, LOC exhibited root mean square (RMS) 3D positional errors of about 22 meters in Monte Carlo simulations. With an optimal measurement window size and a larger number of measurements, the RMS error improved to under 10 meters. The algorithm was also found to be fairly resilient to satellite velocity error due to the error mitigating effects in the LOC processing of the pseudopseudorange data type. A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effects of errors in the surface constraint, showing that overall position error increased linearly with surface constraint error. An analysis was also performed to reveal the relationship between the distance between the user and the reference station; a distance of up to 100 km only lead to an increase of 10 meters in RMS 3D position error. Ultimately, the LOC scheme provides localization with a minimal navigation infrastructure that relaxes hardware requirements and uses a small number of navigation nodes (as small as one).

S	Cheung, KM; Lee, C			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lee, Charles			Navigation Tracking with Multiple Baselines Part I: High-Level Theory and System Concepts	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Delta Differential One-Way Ranging (DDOR) and Same Beam Interferometry (SBI) are deep space tracking techniques that use two widely separated ground antennas, known as a baseline, to simultaneously track a transmitting spacecraft to measure the time difference between signals arriving at the two stations. Errors are introduced into the delay measurements when the radio waves pass through the solar plasma and the Earth's atmosphere, and also due to clock bias and clock instability of the ground stations. These errors can be eliminated or calibrated by tracking a quasar in the angular vicinity of the spacecraft (DDOR), or by tracking another close-by spacecraft whose trajectory/orbit is accurately known (SBI). Both DDOR and SBI uses this double-differencing of signal arrival time to eliminate the aforementioned error sources, and to generates highly accurate angular measurements with respect to the baseline. The three Deep Space Network (DSN) sites cover three approximately equally-spaced longitudes to provide near-continuous coverage of deep space. Spacecraft occasionally see two DSN sites simultaneously, but never three. Current DSN's DDOR and SBI techniques are based on one baseline of two sites. But recent additions of non-DSN deep space antennas and increased cross-support collaborations between space agencies allow spacecraft seeing more than one baselines simultaneously. In this paper, we consider simultaneous SBI of two or more baselines that share one common ground station. We show that under certain condition, precise pointing vector between the common ground station and the spacecraft can be computed using simultaneous DDOR measurements from the two baselines. When there is another spacecraft in the vicinity of the first spacecraft, precise pointing vector of the second spacecraft can be derived from the simultaneous SBI measurements. Also, precise angular distance between the two spacecraft can be computed in real-time. We expect these new data types could enhance ground antenna pointing, and deep space spacecraft trajectory estimation and orbit determination. This technique can have near-Earth applications. We describe a system concept that detects and locates dead and noncooperative spacecraft in the Geostationary Orbit (GEO). This can be done by making use of an existing GEO satellite with accurately known location as a reference, and/or by placing a dedicated "reference" spacecraft into an eccentric geosynchronous orbit over a region of interest (e.g. above North America). By adjusting the orbit, the "reference" spacecraft can sweep through the sky back-and-forth in the vicinity of the GEO over the region. In this way, the reference spacecraft can be close to any "static" GEO targets along its path. Using the multi-static radar approach, the ground transmitting radar illuminates both the reference and target spacecraft, and the ground receiving radars measure the different time-delays of signal arrival. Applying a variant of the aforementioned simultaneous SBI scheme, the time-delay measurements can be used to compute the precise relative position of the target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft, whose position can be accurately estimated using the weak Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals.

A key aspect of these bodies that makes them interesting is their varying morphologies over (and under) their surfaces. To characterize these bodies with in-situ exploration, a surface landing architecture is necessary that allows for the study of multiple diverse areas. Current stationary surface landers have only a short range, limited to capabilities of their on-board instruments and robotic arms. Surface rovers, while more mobile, are inherently more complex than landers and incur high costs both in development and operations. A surface lander capable of performing multiple hops could not only lower the cost of this mobility significantly, but also allow for the characterization of even more diverse areas than a rover. While a rover can cover tens of kilometers over the course of its lifetime, a hopper could potentially perform multiple hops of that same distance. While multiple mission concepts have been proposed (CHOPPER, Mars Geyser Hopper, GRUNT), and some have even flown (MINERVA-II, NEAR Shoemaker, Philae), the only mission to execute a planned hop on the surface of another body is the lunar lander, Surveyor 6. Performed in November of 1967, the results of this three-meter hop experiment contain lessons that will aid the development of future hopping mission concepts. This paper will first summarize previous hop attempts both intentional and unintentional - and proposed concepts for future hopping spacecraft. A more in-depth study of the Surveyor 6 mission will be included, and lessons learned from the study will be applied to other small bodies. Analysis of ballistic, Surveyor 6-like hops, are performed for a diverse catalogue of small bodies including dwarf planet Ceres, comet 67P, and the moon Triton. Feasibilities of hops on each body are then evaluated based on distance and Delta-V, among other considerations. The utility of another style of hop, the "jump-and-wait" method, is also examined for the same bodies and compared to the Surveyor style hop results. The paper will conclude with a summary of the applicability of various types of hops for a variety of small bodies.

As a result, timely and routine data return is critical for nominal rover operations. Mars orbiters are used as relay assets to achieve such timeliness. They also provide greater overall rover data throughput considering their larger data transfer capacity between Mars and Earth. Relay opportunities and their performance are thus tightly coupled to MSL's operations efficiency and science return. With InSight landing only 600 kilometers away and at the same longitude as MSL, orbiter view periods will be shared between the missions, resulting in fewer relay opportunities for MSL. The introduction of MAVEN and TGO as relay assets helps to alleviate this, but the orbit geometries of these spacecraft introduce their own challenges. Unlike sun-synchronous orbiters MRO and ODY, the timing of MAVEN and TGO overflights walks sol-to-sol, resulting in seasonal variations that preclude their usability. The overflights may occur too early in the sol to enable science activities or too late in the sol to be decisional for the subsequent planning cycle. Moreover, the highly elliptical orbit of MAVEN results in much longer view periods as well as intervals of lower or higher data volume return. With the introduction of InSight, MAVEN, and TGO, the MSL mission undertook a design effort in order to define new overflight selection criteria and identify the impact to operational efficiency. Instead of selecting all usable relay opportunities, as was the case with just MRO and ODY, this new paradigm requires deconflicting and down-selecting from available overflights. The overflight selection algorithm presented in this study selects based on key overflight metrics such as timing, the predicted data volume return, and the latency between the relay and data arrival to Earth. The relative priority of each of these metrics is scenario-specific; thus, the algorithm is flexible and configurable for when mission priorities evolve. Additionally, operational constraints and considerations such as human factors are applied. The resulting tactical planning timeline post-InSight landing suggests comparable operational efficiency to the pre-InSight era but yields more variation in the timing of the planning shifts, adding strain on the MSL planning team.

SmallSat Missions Enabled by Paired Low-Thrust Hybrid Rocket and Low-Power Long-Life Hall Thruster	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS	The capabilities of a SmallSat-class spacecraft targeting the outer solar system and using a combined chemical and electric propulsion system are explored. The development of compact hybrid rockets has enabled high-thrust engines to be packaged tightly enough to fit on CubeSat and SmallSat spacecraft. These hybrid rockets provide 10's-100 N of thrust depending on the propellant load & >300 s of specific impulse and have been demonstrated in both ambient and vacuum environments. Advancements in low-power long-life Hall thruster technologies have provided the potential for significantly greater propellant throughputs, enabling their use as a primary propulsion element on interplanetary spacecraft. In a recent characterization test campaign, the MaSMi-DM Hall thruster demonstrated power throttling from 150 -1000 W with >1500 s of specific impulse available at >500 W and >= 40% total thrust efficiency available at >300 W; peak values of 1940 s and 53%, respectively, were observed. A notional low-mass spacecraft employing a combined hybrid rocket and low-power electric propulsion system was designed and used for mission concept analysis targeting the outer solar system. Using an imposed wet mass limit of 400 kg, mission trajectories to Saturn and Uranus were generated. Orbit capture with >40% of the launch mass was shown to be possible at either target, with mission transfer times of 7.5 years and 13.5 years for Saturn and Uranus, respectively. Significant follow-on mission activities near Saturn (e.g. to Titan & Enceladus) were also possible by carrying extra propellant mass while remaining under the total wet mass limit.

Graham, Arizona. The Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems (HOSTS) is a NASA key project for the LBTI surveying the warm and hot dust in the inner regions of planetary systems, near the habitable zone (HZ) and closer in, commonly described as being 'exo-zodiacal,' analogous to the zodiacal light in our Solar System. The presence of large amounts of dust in the HZs of nearby stars poses a significant challenge for target selection and planning of future exo-Earth imaging missions. The HOSTS survey on the LBTI is designed to determine typical exozodi levels around a sample of nearby, bright main sequence stars. The LBTI operates in a nulling mode in the mid-infrared spectral window (8-13 mu m), in which light from the two telescopes is coherently combined with a 180-degree phase shift between them, producing a dark fringe at the location of the target star. In doing so the starlight is greatly reduced, increasing the contrast, analogous to a coronagraph operating at shorter wavelengths. The LBTI is a unique instrument, having only three warm reflections before the starlight reaches cold mirrors, giving it the best photometric sensitivity of any interferometer operating in the mid-infrared. It also has a superb Adaptive Optics (AO) system giving it Strehl ratios greater than 98% at 10 mu m. Thus, nulling interferometry suppresses the bright stellar light and allows for the detection of faint, extended circumstellar dust emission. In this paper we present statistical results from 38 individual stars. We provide important new insights into the incidence rate, typical levels, and origin of HZ dust around main sequence stars. Our overall detection rate is 23%. While the inferred occurrence rates are comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decrease from [71 (+11/20)]% for stars with previously detected mid to far infrared excess to [11 (+9/-4)]% for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at high confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal excess luminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 11.5 zodis (95% confidence) for all stars without cold dust and of 16 zodis when focussing on Sun-like stars without cold dust. We find first hints of a bimodal distribution where some stars have high HZ dust levels but the majority have dust levels below our sensitivity. Our results demonstrate the strength of LBTI for vetting potential targets for future exo-Earth imaging missions.

S	Divsalar, D; Net, MS; Cheung, KM			IEEE	Divsalar, Dariush; Net, Marc Sanchez; Cheung, Kar-Ming			Acquisition and tracking for communications between Lunar South Pole and Earth	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we design and analyze an end-to-end communication system between a lander/rover on the surface of the lunar South Pole and an Earth station. The acquisition and tracking system is discussed in detail. The communication system on the lander or rover could be used for the Earth-to-Moon communication. To communicate to and from the lander/rover on the lunar South Pole, low and/or medium directional antennas onboard the lander/rover will have to be pointed at low elevation angles between 2 to 10 degrees, thus causing multipath fading effects due to reflection of a portion of the transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface of the Moon that are not commonly encountered in traditional deep space communications between a spacecraft and a ground station. To design and analyze such a communication system, and in particular the acquisition and tracking system, in the presence of multipath fading, first we model the fading channel based on existing and simulated data. In addition to multipath fading, the channel also introduces Doppler frequency up to 11.5 KHz, and Doppler rate up to 0.735 Hz/sec. For coherent reception the Doppler frequency, which is time varying, should be acquired and the incoming carrier phase, which includes the fading phase, should be tracked in the presence of multipath fading. For this communication system in addition to estimating the received carrier phase, the amplitude of the fading signal should also be estimated, in particular to be used in the decoder. In addition to acquisition and tracking, we consider simple modulation and coding schemes. Space diversity using two antennas on earth to mitigate the effects of fading could also be used. We design phase-locked loops and frequency sweeping schemes robust to the attenuations due to fading. After designing various components of the communication system, we use Simulink models to obtain the end-to-end performance of the communication link under investigation. Based on the available data, the fading channel can be accurately modeled as a Rician fading channel with Rician parameter of 10 dB, and Doppler spread that depends on the Doppler frequency and the transmit/receive antenna patterns. The challenge is how to make such a communication system robust in the presence of the multipath fading where the Doppler spread changes in time and thus produces fading with time-varying durations (short and very long fades). In summary, this paper covers communication system design, performance analysis, and simulations for performance of Doppler frequency acquisition, tracking, uncoded system, and coded system under ideal interleaving assumption with hard decision over communication link between a lander/rover at the Lunar south pole and a DSN Earth station in presence of Rician fading.

The instrument has been used to detect deformation from earthquakes, volcanoes, oil pumping, landslides, water withdrawal, landfill compaction, and glaciers. It has been used to detect scars from wildfires and damage from debris flows. The instrument performs well for large changes or for local small changes. Determining subtle changes over large areas requires improved instrumentation and processing. We are working to improve the utility of UAVSAR by including GPS station position results in the processing chain, and adding a topographic imager to improve estimates of topography, 3D change, and damage. We are also exploring the benefit of microwave radiometry to mitigating error from water vapor path delay. A goal is to determine 3D tectonic deformation to millimeters per year at similar to 100 km plate boundary scales and to understand surface processes in areas of decorrelated radar imagery.

S	Dooley, J			IEEE	Dooley, Jennifer			Direct-to-Earth Mission Concept for a Europa Lander	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				A NASA HQ-directed study team led by JPL with partners including APL, MSFC, GSFC, LaRC and Sandia National Laboratory has recently presented an updated mission concept for a Europa Lander that would search for bio-signatures and signs of life in the near-subsurface of the Jovian moon. This paper will describe that mission architecture including science objectives, interplanetary and delivery trajectory, flight system, planetary protection architecture and mission phases. The mission would follow the Europa Multiple-Flyby Mission Clipper planned for launch in 2023, which would provide reconnaissance imagery and other data to the Lander for use in selecting a scientifically compelling site and certifying it for engineering safety. The Europa Lander concept accommodates the Model Payload identified by the Europa Lander Science Definition Team (SDT) and documented in the Europa Lander Study 2016 Report released in February of 2017. Since holding a Mission Concept Review (MCR) in June of 2017, HQ directed the study team to further explore the architectural trade space with a goal of reducing the mission cost. Based on the results of that study, in December of 2017 HQ directed the study team to focus on biosignature science and shift to a Direct-to-Earth communication architecture. The currently envisioned Europa Lander would launch on an SLS Block 1B as early as Fall of 2026 into a DV-Earth-Mars-Gravity Assist (DVEMGA) trajectory, arriving in the Jovian system as early as mid-2031. The baseline design of the integrated flight system includes a Carrier Stage, a Deorbit Vehicle composed of a Deorbit Stage consisting of a solid rocket motor (SRM), an MSL-like sky-crane Descent Stage, and a Lander which accommodates the instrument suite. The Lander would be powered by primary batteries over a 20+ day surface mission. The science goals envisioned by the SDT for biosignature science require three samples taken from a depth of 10 cm, a depth chosen to ensure minimal radiation processing of the potential biomarkers. Mission challenges include the large launch mass, unknown terrain topography, surface composition and materials properties, the high radiation environment, and complying with the stringent planetary protection requirements. The mission concept uses a strategy of early risk reduction and overlapping requirements to provide robustness to harsh and uncertain environments. Early risk reduction efforts are aimed at maturing technologies associated with the sampling system, the intelligent landing system, high specific energy batteries, low mass and power motor controllers, and a thermal sterilization system.

S	Dutta, S; Soriano, M			IEEE	Dutta, Shweta; Soriano, Melissa			Optimizing Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying during Spacecraft Critical Events for Future Missions	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				When attempting to land on a planetary body, perform a complex direction change, or even while simply cruising, challenges arise in spacecraft to Earth communications. If a spacecraft must perform a complicated maneuver such as orbit insertion, the spacecraft often cannot use its High Gain Antenna (HGA) for communication to another craft, or back to Earth. Additionally, if the spacecraft enters a fault state, it is possible that the antennas cannot be oriented as precisely. In these scenarios, a Low Gain Antenna (LGA) may be used to communicate limited information to know that the spacecraft is alive in the former situation, and to recover the spacecraft in the latter situation, so it is imperative to use communication methods that have a high probability of correctly obtaining a weak signal. This study will first summarize the mechanism to predict the probability of successfully detecting the carrier frequency and data tones used in Multiple Frequency-Shift Keying (MFSK, or tones) by the spacecraft, and then explore the applicability of MFSK in future missions for events including but not limited to orbit insertion; entry, decent, and landing (EDL); and safe modes. Using the search space, non-coherent integration time, fast Fourier Transform (FFT) bandwidth, and modulation index, one may compute the predicted probability of correctly detecting and tracking a frequency versus the total power to noise ratio. Tones allowed for communication with planetary landers and other spacecraft in the past, namely the Mars Exploration Rover (MER), Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), both primarily for EDL, and Juno for orbit insertion. Following the models outlined in [ 1], we demonstrate the probability of properly detecting a tone during JOI to be greater than 99% under worst-case expected operating conditions for the Europa Clipper mission. We also examine the optimal use of tones during other spacecraft critical events, such Europa Clipper's safe mode recovery via examination of parameter modifications to MFSK as used in Juno, MER, and MSL, and comparing how these modifications perform compared to the original technique.

Relay communications would be crucial for supporting this campaign, characterized by multiple critical events, complex surface operations, and an on-orbit Mars rendezvous. The existing Mars relay network offers significant capability, and efforts are underway to maximize the likelihood that one or more of these current assets will still be operational in the timeframe of an MSR campaign. In addition, the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) element of a campaign could serve as a primary relay asset, if it can achieve a useful relay orbit by the time of arrival of the Sample Retrieval Lander mission. We describe key operational challenges of the MSR campaign that would drive the required relay capabilities, and characterize the performance of the existing relay orbiters as well as ERO itself in meeting those relay needs.

Optimal Solution for Torque Capability of Control Moment Gyroscopes	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			STEERING LOGIC; LAW	This paper improves the generality and performance of constraint-based steering laws for control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). Specifically, the paper provides analytical, closed-form gimbal-angle constraint functions that maximize the torque capability for arrays with parallel gimbal axes. The analytical solutions define an optimal gimbal-angle set for a given angular-momentum state for any planar array with four or more CMGs. Proofs verify the global optimality of the provided gimbal-angle set constraints for nearly all angular-momentum states. For angular-momentum states where an analytical proof is not provided, a numerical assessment provides evidence of global optimality. The solutions can be applied to planar and non-planar arrays consisting of planar segments of CMGs, such as roof arrays and box arrays. The gimbal-angle constraint functions also enable fault-tolerant steering laws because the constraint functions apply to any number of planar CMGs greater than four. Thus, if one or more CMGs fail, the resulting steering law can still perform optimally. The gimbal-angle constraint functions are broadly applicable to aerospace and robotics problems. In their more general form, these constraints optimize velocity-tracking capability of planar serial manipulators, which benefits tasks requiring large velocities of the end effector, such as rapid mobile manipulation and intercepting fast-moving objects. Due to their generality, the constraint functions are applicable to hyper-redundant multi-degree-of-freedom systems, including elephant trunks and snakelike robots. Simulations comparing the performance of this approach to that of existing constraint-based methods illustrate the improvements.	[Elliott, D.

By leveraging the geometric information encoded into stereolithography (STL) files, it is sought to address the computational intractability imposed by the naive generation of dense target point clouds solely based on the target's known surface. To this end, the proposed approach computes a bijective projection onto the known triangular mesh to obtain a target point cloud with which to use ICP techniques for incremental alignment; the projection step is then carried on recursively until the convergence criteria are met, yielding a relative 6DOF pose between the two objects to be used within the estimation pipeline. Demonstrations of the algorithm are presented using simulated datasets; results include time complexity analyses for real-time operation cases, performance variation assessments with respect to CAD model complexity, and sensitivity analysis for determining the tolerance to distinct noise levels and spurious measurements. The design and implementation of the algorithm makes use of the open-source Point Cloud Library, and access to its source code is included within this work.

It is expected to remain in orbit at least through October 2019. Developed as a technology demonstration mission under the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Phaeton Program for training early-career engineers, ASTERIA has achieved sub-arcsecond pointing stability and milliKelvin thermal stability over 20-minute observations. These capabilities-unprecedented in a CubeSat platform-have enabled photometric precision better than 1000 parts per million per minute (0.1%/min) while observing nearby bright stars (apparent visual magnitude mag(V) < 6). Following the second extended mission, we are now using the spacecraft in its third extension as a platform to demonstrate additional capabilities as well as continue science observations. This project will perform the following four well-focused activities that will raise the technology readiness of key spacecraft technologies. 1. Shift the paradigm to operate spacecraft from openloop commanding to closed-loop command execution: We will introduce "task networks" (tasknets) which allow simpler commanding and more robust onboard execution. 2. Demonstrate onboard orbit determination in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using autonomous navigation (Autonav) without the Global Positioning System (GPS): This activity will demonstrate a fully independent means of spacecraft orbit determination for Earth orbiters using only passive imaging. 3. Collect data on ASTERIA that will feed into future missions by characterizing the spacecraft pointing jitter as a function of target brightness, reaction wheel speed, controller gain, and number of guide stars. 4. Perform ASTERIA extended mission science: ASTERIA has demonstrated unprecedented photometric precision for a CubeSat mission. The spacecraft is uniquely suited to perform long-term monitoring of stars such as alpha Centauri for small transiting planets. The discovery of a transiting Earth-sized planet around alpha Cen A and/or B would be of the highest scientific value as such a planet would be our closest exoplanetary neighbor orbiting a Sun-like star. These demonstrations will provide in-flight testing of new autonomy technologies, maximize the scientific potential of this operational spacecraft, and provide additional characterization of hardware for future small satellite missions using similar subsystems.

With the creation of the automatic HAB launcher Talos, the i2F team has taken what was once a 15+ person job of launching a 5.44 kg (12 lb) payload via a 3000 g (3 m diameter at launch) latex HAB and has reduced it to a single-person task. Furthermore, the time from arrival at the launch site to launching a payload via Talos is still under one hour. The majority of that time is consumed by the inflation of the balloon. The i2F team has additionally overhauled the Zephyrus avionics and communications systems, which are now able to support two-way communications with the ground station while hosting several experiments. This is contained within a 1.2U CubeSat form-factor. The team has additionally designed and built two antenna tracking units for use during operations. This system can uplink and downlink data at a range tested to 160 km (100 miles). The 2018 project campaign for the updated Zephyrus flight vehicle, the Talos automatic HAB launcher, and the long-range two-way telemetry system, was constructed and tested within a span of 10 weeks and on a materials budget of less than $10,000.

Requirements Development and Management on the Psyche Project	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In January 2017, Psyche was one of two mission concepts selected by NASA for flight as part of the 14th Discovery mission competition. The project has been staffing up and maturing the spacecraft, instrument and mission system baseline designs on the path towards a 2022 launch. During much of 2018, the Project has been executing the lifecycle stage called Phase B, "Preliminary Design and Technology Completion," one key element of which is the development and management of requirements at various levels. In the case of the Psyche project, this process has been particularly unique for several reasons. The project utilizes a Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) Chassis from Space Systems Loral (SSL), a high volume manufacturer of commercial geostationary (GEO) telecom spacecraft based on the 1300 satellite bus. While SSL has an extensive, well-vetted set of requirements based on their very successful Earth-orbiting product line, translating that heritage to a deep space science mission required special care. In addition to the differences associated with the deep space environment and longer communication times, new interfaces had to be incorporated. While a substantial portion of the Flight System consists of the SEP Chassis, there were several new interfaces within various subsystems between SSL components and those provided by JPL and other contractors. Managing these interfaces through requirements at a relatively higher level than normally seen on internal or external builds proved challenging. Finally, the Psyche spacecraft plans to host the flight terminal of the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) technology demonstration, which is itself a separate project with its own requirements that must be flowed down and managed. This paper will present an overview of the requirement development and management process for the Psyche project. It will discuss in detail the various challenges summarized above, the methods and decisions chosen to address them, and evaluate their overall effectiveness at this stage in the project.

Valuable insight into many astrophysical processes could be gained by having a radio interferometer in space to image the low frequency window, which has never been achieved. One application for such a system is observing type II bursts that track solar energetic particle acceleration occurring at Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-driven shocks. In this work we create a data processing pipeline for the pathfinder mission SunRISE, a 6 CubeSat interferometer to circle the Earth in a GEO graveyard orbit, and evaluate its performance in localizing type II bursts with a simulated CME. Traditional radio astronomy software is hard coded to assume an Earth based array. To circumvent this, we manually calculate the antenna separations and insert them along with the simulated visibilities into a CASA MS file for analysis. We model the response of different array configurations over the 25 hour orbit, combining an ephemeris for the Sun with simulated recovered positions of spacecraft using GPS localization to get the array geometry into the correct frame for processing. We include realistic thermal noise dominated by the galactic background at these low frequencies, as well as new sources of phase noise from positional uncertainty of each spacecraft. To create realistic virtual type II input data, we employ a 2-temperature MHD simulation of the May 13th 2005 CME event, and superimpose realistic radio emission models on the CME-driven shock front, and propagate the signal through the simulated array. Data cuts based on different plasma parameter thresholds (e.g. de Hoffman-Teller velocity and angle between shock normal and the upstream magnetic field) are tested to get the best match to the true recorded emission. We test simulated trajectories of SunRISE and image what the array recovers, comparing it to the virtual input, finding that SunRISE can resolve the source of type II emission to within its prescribed goal of 1/3 the CME width more than 99% of the time with 5 or 6 spacecraft, and 97.5% of the time with 4 spacecraft.

Correlators for Synthetic Apertures in Space	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we analyze existing technology and simulate possible work flows to find the best hardware and data processing strategies for the position solving and correlation steps of space based radio arrays at various scales. Such arrays are composed of many free flying spacecraft, and accurate knowledge of their relative positions is necessary for proper data analysis. By using signals from existing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites, each individual spacecraft may record data that can be used to solve for precise orbit determination (POD) solutions to determine the relative propagation delays between each spacecraft pair. Any errors in the position are translated into phase error of the complex correlation data. The acceptable limits of error in position before harming the localization of the radio array are tested, using localization performance of SunRISE as a test case. This work help sets requirements for future space based arrays, particularly the quality of GNSS signal needed on each spacecraft as well as correlator capabilities. It is found that there are several feasible hardware and software combinations available today that could constitute a space based array, and recommendations are provided on which combinations would be well suited for various correlation strategies.

In this paper we document the analogy algorithms as well as summarize the results of the performance of the KNN and the principle components (PCA) cluster analogy models. KNN performance is assessed by varying the number of inputs and number of neighbors. Four different clustering methods: K-means, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principle Components Analysis (PCA), and their respective evaluation criterion are described in detail.

The Tool for Architectural Tradespace Exploration and Refinement, or "TATER", will encompass a broad set of analyses covering the driving factors needed to describe and compare concepts, from trajectories and technologies to cost and risk assessment and science value. At the core of TATER is a spacecraft design model suite, which allows a single user to design a self-consistent spacecraft with limited information. TATER estimates mass, power, and cost at the subsystem level, key design metrics that can be used to assess a concept's likelihood of meeting requirements. Thus, TATER provides users with a quantified basis for comparing design options early in the concept maturity timeline, so that the most promising options can be identified and selected for further development. Built on a framework of intertwined analyses, TATER incorporates both analytical relationships and empirical scaling models. The data sources behind the empirical models include historical actuals, proposals, and established rules-of-thumb. Originally constructed in Phoenix ModelCenter, TATER now utilizes the JPL Integrated Modeling Environment (IME), a web-based software architecture developed in-house for JPL's concurrent engineering teams. This paper describes the TATER data structure and analyses in detail, including the required inputs and expected outputs from the spacecraft design model. Additionally, the results of verification and validation activities are presented, comparing the output of TATER to that of higher-fidelity design models. These results have revealed some areas to be improved, but demonstrate that TATER is ready for pilot use in early formulation studies for preliminary feasibility checks.

This system is designed to be packaged within a 12 U envelope and deliver approximately 800 m/s Delta V to a 25 kg spacecraft. The hybrid motor uses green propellants, specifically gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer and solid Poly(Methyl MethAcrylate) (PMMA), also known as acrylic, as the fuel. This propellant combination is separated by phase and is non-toxic and non-hypergolic, making the design well suited for use within a secondary payload where safety is paramount. The hybrid motor has high performance with an I-sp of approximately 300 s and is able to be re-ignited, enabling numerous maneuvers to be conducted. The system also provides thrust vector control during main motor operation and attitude control for reaction wheel un-loading during the science mission phase. A dedicated test program has been conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the past three years to progress this design towards flight and verify the design assumptions. This paper will summarize the results of this test program and the demonstrated performance of the motor. A path to progress this system towards flight shall also be discussed.

ECOSTRESS End-to-End Radiometric Validation	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) will measure the brightness temperature (BT) of plants from the space station. This information will be used to generate products such as evapotranspiration (ET) over an effective diurnal cycle to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stresses (i.e. lack of water, sun, nutrients). The imaging radiometer on board the ECOSTRESS payload provides five thermal infrared (TIR) spectral bands with approximately 70 m pixels and a nearly 400km swath. It incorporates many new technologies such as a high-speed Mercury Cadmium Telluride (MCT) focal plane array (FPA), black silicon calibration targets, and a thermal suppression filter allowing shortwave infrared (SWIR) bandpass. This radiometer has two on-board blackbodies to maintain calibration every sweep of the scan mirror (1.29 s). The system has undergone an end-to-end test in a thermal-vacuum (TVAC) chamber showing excellent pre-flight radiometric results. This performance is in part enabled by newly developed, high-speed, low noise, readout electronics. The readout electronics converts all 32-analog channels to digital for downstream on board processing and downlink. Noise equivalent delta temperature (NE Delta T) measurements and BT retrievals are well within requirements. The optical modulation transfer function (OMTF) is also within specification. The instrument was launched on SpaceX CRS-15 along with the Latching End Effector for Canadaarm2 as well as three Biarri-Squad cubesats. ECOSTRESS passed In-Orbit Checkout (IOC). This is where all systems as well as science/calibration data are checked and verified to be operational. The payload is currently in Phase E operations. ECOSTRESS uses a local WiFi that sends data from the payload to the ISS. Data packets are then downlinked to the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) and subsequently archived in the science data system (SDS) servers. A series of calibration targets (Lake Tahoe and the Salton Sea) have been utilized to verify the top of atmosphere radiometric integrity of the science data. Other geometrical targets such as the crop fields of California and a few large bridges around CONUS have been used to verify the geolocation accuracy when compared with previous data from (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) VIIRS and ASTER.

It can provide astrometric measurements of spacecraft orbiting planets and other objects in our solar system with subnrad precision (5 nrad = 1 milli-arcsec). These measurements can be used to create a time series of positions for solar system objects in the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame, which in turn can be combined with other data to refine the planetary ephemeris. An accurate solar system ephemeris is critical for interplanetary spacecraft navigation, dynamical studies and tests of gravitational theories, the analysis of pulsar timing observations, predictions of transits, eclipses, and occultations, and other applications. We are using VLBA observations of the Juno spacecraft in orbit about Jupiter to provide accurate positions for the Jupiter system barycenter for the ephemeris development group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, using observing and data reduction techniques developed for similar observations of the Cassini spacecraft while it orbited Saturn from 2004 until 2017. The VLBA observations of Cassini helped to improve the accuracy of Saturn's orbit by nearly an order of magnitude, and we expect that our observations of Juno will produce a similar improvement in our knowledge of Jupiter's orbit. Astrometric positions are particularly useful in constraining the orientation (inclination and longitude of ascending node) of an orbit, while range measurements are most useful in constraining the semi-major axis and ellipticity. Juno's orbit around Jupiter has a longer period than initially planned due to a concern about the spacecraft main engine. The resulting extended mission duration will improve our constraints on Jupiter's orbit inclination beyond that originally expected. Our VLBA observations of Juno are scheduled during approximately every third or fourth perijove pass. During these times the Juno spacecraft is continuously tracked by the Deep Space Network and the most precise solutions for the orbit of Juno about Jupiter are available. A good spacecraft orbit solution is needed to transfer our spacecraft sky positions to planet system barycenter positions. VLBA astrometry of planetary spacecraft has previously been applied to Mars orbiting space-craft, and will also be used during the OSIRISREx mission to improve the accuracy of the orbit of the potentially hazardous asteroid Bennu.

To reduce development costs and increase commonality among these traditionally custom-built receivers, the implementation team has developed a flexible architecture built primarily around commercial off-the-shelf hardware compliant with the Micro Telecommunications Computing Architecture (uTCA) specification and commercial high speed 10Gbit Ethernet switches. Custom firmware and software are being developed to perform the required signal processing functions needed to replace the legacy systems in a phased implementation approach which establishes a new digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal distribution system first, followed by implementations of various receiver functions as dictated by need. The first of these new receivers, the Open Loop Receiver, will come online in the Fall of 2018.

A NASA team from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Ames Research Center (ARC) is leading and coordinating this program. A new propellant combination: the wax-based fuel, SP7, and MON-30 were proposed for a hybrid option for the MAV propulsion system several years ago. Since that time, hotfire testing with a similar propellant combination (SP7/MON-3) has been completed and a pathway to achieving high performance with the flight propellant combination is currently being pursued.

By imaging and determining the location of decametric-hectometric (DH) radio bursts from 0.1 MHz-25 MHz, SunRISE would provide key information on particle acceleration mechanisms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the magnetic field topology from active regions into interplanetary space. Six small spacecraft, of a 6U form factor, would fly in a supersynchronous geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) orbit within about 10 km of each other, in a passive formation, and image the Sun in a portion of the spectrum that is blocked by the ionosphere and cannot be observed from Earth. Key aspects that enable this mission concept are that only position knowledge of the spacecraft is required, not active control, and that the architecture involves a modest amount of on-board processing coupled with significant ground-based processing for navigation, position determination, and science operations. Mission-enabling advances in software-defined radios, GPS navigation and timing, and small spacecraft technologies, developed and flown over the past few years on DARPA High Frequency Research (DHFR), the Community Initiative for Continuing Earth Radio Occultation (CICERO), and the Mars Cube One (MarCO) missions, have made this concept affordable and low-risk. The SunRISE concept would involve utilizing commercial access to space, in which the SunRISE spacecraft would be carried to their target orbit as a secondary payload in conjunction with a larger host spacecraft intended for GEO.

The vault is a box structure made out of aluminum panels. The panels are roughly 10 mm thick in order to shield the electronics from the orbital total ionizing radiation around Jupiter. The vault requires an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of at least 70 dB in order to mitigate EMI with the spacecraft radar receiver. Overall, the vault accommodates four main types of penetrations: receptacle connectors, pass-through cables, fluid lines, and vent holes. More than 150 cables penetrate the vault panels to connect to electronic boxes inside. Fluid pipes enter and exit the vault to transfer heat to the rest of the spacecraft. Vent holes provide a path for air to escape from the vault during launch. Several novel penetrations designs were created to meet EMI and radiation shielding requirements. Receptacle connectors interface to the vault panels using 1.3 mm thick Ta10W plates. Pass-through cables penetrate the vault using aluminum clamshells after being wrapped with Teflon cushion tape, Kapton tape, and copper tape. Vent hole penetrations consist of a copper mesh for EMI shielding and an aluminum radiation shield bracket to direct air out of the vault during launch. Fluid lines terminate at the vault wall using mechanical fittings that resemble a nut and bolt interface. In addition, most mechanical seams and penetrations utilize EMI gaskets to ensure proper EMI shielding. To reduce risk and confirm that the vault penetration designs were appropriate for EMI shielding, an EMI chamber at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was used to test a mock-up vault panel with multiple variations of all four types of vault penetrations. This EMI SE test also incorporated different methods for bundling pass-through cables, and a comparison of flange mounted connectors versus jam nut connectors. A low noise preamplifier and a Rohde & Schwarz spectrum analyzer measured E-field levels transmitting through the mock-up vault panel. The results showed a shielding effectiveness of 77 dB for the mock-up vault panel, which exceeds the 70 dB target for Europa Clipper. Both the flange mounted connectors and jam nut connectors exhibited similar EMI SE results at the measured frequencies, and all variations of vault penetrations showed favorable EMI SE levels. Since the flight panels will be much larger and include many more penetrations, there will be testing of the flight vault to confirm its EMI SE is compliant with environmental requirements.

Athena's mobility system includes independent steering and driving motors for six wheels as well as wheel position sensors. The rover mobility system proved particularly challenging to model due to limited visibility into lower level wheel assembly hardware, a high degree of terrain interaction, and incomplete understanding of Athena behavior. However, even with simplified models, MONSID proved able to detect 16 distinct anomaly types during functional tests and simulated science activities carried out in JPL's Mars Yard. These faults included simulated and actual motor faults as well as instances of stalls due to terrain. Additionally, several detected faults were discovered during MONSID testing that were not anticipated.

S	Kuhn, S			IEEE	Kuhn, Stephen			From Determinism to Emergence: Systems Engineering a Step Change in Execution on Mars	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Mars rover operators have traditionally controlled the execution of behaviors using meticulously compiled "master" sequences that enforce deterministic timing and ordering of activities. While the approach is effective at managing risk and complexity, it can be inefficient. Determinism demands conservatism in all things and is mitigated only at the cost of fidelity in ground modeling of flight behavior, an elusive goal. Direct manipulation, as well as inspection by mission operators of the automation layers used to build a schedule, is both feasible and time-consuming. The Mars 2020 rover mission plans to introduce a fundamentally different high-level scheduling and execution approach. Atomic activities are constrained by operators in time, resource usage, and a structure of state dependencies, from largely reusable first principles. The rover flight software will create and re-create a schedule of activities, responding to available energy, actual activity durations and execution status, observed temperatures, and other on-board state. The solution space of possible schedules is prohibitively large and probabilistic. Direct manipulation and inspection of automation are no longer possible on the shortened tactical timelines envisioned for the mission. Schedules are permitted and expected to change substantially as execution burns down the plan. Emergent behavior is accessible depending on the interaction of a given formulation of the plan with actual on-board state. The architecture must anticipate and provide capabilities in the flight software and/or ground tools to help steer emergence. It must leverage the facilities of a highly inherited system to the greatest extent feasible. It must function in that small sliver of computational capacity available in an already diminutive processor, lest it cannibalize from executing activities the efficiency it seeks to gain. This paper discusses the challenges and considerations in systems engineering the first planned autonomous high-level activity planner on Mars.

Anticipated benefits of intra-spacecraft wireless links include reduction of cable mass, improved flexibility in spacecraft design or modifications and increased efficiencies during integration and test. This paper describes the framework for this effort, plans for retiring key risks and progress to date. Three of the primary risks addressed under this effort are communications link reliability, scalability and electromagnetic compatibility. In this paper, we will discuss analysis and test methods used to investigate each of these areas.

As spacecraft size decreases, physical limitations present new challenges for mission designers. These include limited instrument aperture, low communications bandwidth, and reduced attitude control. Software techniques can address these limitations to retain the capabilities of larger spacecraft, in a small form factor. These techniques move the first order science analysis, which is traditionally completed on the ground, onboard the spacecraft. This can minimize the amount of data volume required for first order decision making. We present a collection of techniques designed for mitigating limited pointing stability for target acquisition, onboard image calibration and decision making, in a low bandwidth environment. These technologies will fly on the Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout) interplanetary CubeSat mission in 2019 [1]. To support verification and validation, the flight software implementations of these algorithms have been run on New Horizons, Rosetta and terrestrially acquired data sets. These experiments validate the capability to detect the target, through noise and target location uncertainty.

Digital Holographic Microscope Trades for Extant Life Detection Applications	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			VIKING; COMPACT; MARS	Optical microscopy is one of the key technologies needed for detection of extant life on other solar system bodies. Microscopic images can be used to identify the presence of cell-like objects and discriminate probable cells from other abiotic particles of similar scale through observations of morphology. Image sequences can be used to determine particle density through observation of Brownian motion, enabling discrimination of liquid-filled vesicles from solid mineral grains; non-Brownian motion that is also inconsistent with background flow can also indicate biotic particles. Phase-sensitive imaging modes allow measurement of index of refraction and can be used to image transparent cells that might otherwise require the addition of stains. Because of the likely limited energy available for replication on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, potential unicellular life would likely be present only at very low concentrations requiring a search through substantial volumes of material at very high resolution. We have been developing digital holographic microscopes (DHM) that addresses the need for high resolution search at low concentrations. Our DHM designs provide both the sub micrometer resolution necessary to detect the smallest forms of life and the high throughput needed to do so at very low concentrations. A significant feature of the holographic recording is that all objects in a large volume can be recorded simultaneously, without the need for focus or tracking to image individual objects. We have demonstrated two promising DHM architectures for possible use in potential future life detection missions-one using conventional optics and one using gradient index optics in a "lensless" arrangement. We compare the two designs, their trade spaces, and the features that might make each preferable for specific applications.	[Lindensmith, Christian; Serabyn, Eugene; Wallace, J.

Riders on the Storm: NASA InSight Lander and the 2018 Mars Global Dust Storm	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				On May 5, 2018, NASA's InSight spacecraft, carrying an international scientific payload with which to explore the interior of Mars, launched from Vandenburg AFB, California, and began its six-and-a-half-month voyage to Mars. Four weeks later, on June 3, 2018, a powerful regional Martian dust storm surged through Meridiani Planum and within days had left the 14-year-old Opportunity rover in darkness and generating insufficient solar power to operate. On June 10, Opportunity sent signals including information that the optical depth ("tau") of the thick dust blanketing the atmosphere was an all-time high ever measured from the Martian surface, at a value of 10.8. Then Opportunity soon afterwards experienced a power fault and ceased communicating with her ground controllers. By June 20, the storm had spread across the entire planet Mars, darkening the skies at Gale Crater where the Curiosity Rover had been ascending the foothills of Mount Sharp, on the opposite side of Mars from Opportunity. Record-setting, high atmospheric dust levels continued to be measured and reported by the Curiosity team, as the storm became global. Among those keeping daily tabs on the enormous storm that swiftly enshrouded the Red Planet were the InSight flight team of engineers and scientists, whose recently-launched spacecraft was functioning quite well in flight and now five and a half months away from an unchangeable landing date at Mars November 26, 2018. As our spacecraft hurtled through interplanetary space towards its destination, the InSight team took stock of the situation. Would this enormous dust storm still be raging when InSight arrived? What, if anything, had this storm changed in the assumptions made by InSight's design and test engineers about Martian atmospheric conditions for descending to the surface, or generating power there? Would InSight survive and carry out her mission?

It's the gold standard for the development and implementation of new technologies on NASA spacecraft, and originates from the idea that technologies that have flown can be expected to fly successfully again. While the risks associated with developing a new technology and using it in space are considered by NASA and most of the space community to have been retired by a first flight, there is no guarantee of reliability or success the next time the technology is used in space. In a recent paper, Straub [1] proposed establishing a TRL 10 level that indicates "proven technology demonstrated through extended operations". After extensive discussion on the need for this and the possible definition, he suggested that a TRL definition higher than 9 would be useful in recognizing and taking advantage of higher maturity space hardware. Multiple other papers have made the case that hardware that has flown successfully and essentially unchanged multiple times will certainly have higher reliability and lower implementation risk than single flight units. The Psyche mission provides a unique case for testing these arguments about higher maturity hardware and extending the TRL scale beyond TRL 9. NASA's Psyche mission is procuring the majority of its spacecraft bus from SSL's commercial communication product line, which features spacecraft components and technologies with tens to hundreds of successful flights. In many cases, multiple generations of this hardware have been matured based on lessons learned, which guarantees reliability greatly in excess of one-shot hardware. This paper takes another look at the development of the TRL scale, arguments for its extension, and its application to NASA missions in the light of the flight proven, highly reliable commercial hardware described in this paper. We propose two additional TRL levels adopting and refining prior efforts to define levels of hardware maturity beyond TRL 9. This allows NASA to recognize and utilize the benefits of more mature technologies to build better spacecraft that can reliably explore the solar system; better, faster and cheaper than ever before.

Overview of the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) Concept Architecture	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Habitable Exoplanet Observatory (HabEx) is one of four large mission studies commissioned by NASA for the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astrophysics. HabEx has identified three driving science goals: 1) to seek out nearby worlds and explore their habitability, 2) to map out nearby planetary systems and understand the diversity of the worlds they contain, and 3) to enable new explorations of astrophysical systems from our solar system to galaxies and the universe by extending our reach in the UV through near-IR. To achieve these goals, the HabEx study has baselined a space telescope at Sun-Earth L2, with a 4 m aperture and four science instruments - a coronagraph, a starshade, a high resolution UV spectrograph, and a multi-purpose, wide-field camera. The second part of the observatory is an external starshade occulter of 52 m diameter. To achieve the precision and stability required for the coronagraph to image earth-sized exoplanets to better than 10(-10) contrast, the telescope flight system is equipped with a vector vortex coronagraph and colloidal electrospray microthrusters. The telescope takes advantage of the mass and volume launch capability of NASA's SLS Block 1B delivery system with a separate launch for the starshade on a smaller vehicle. In this paper, we provide an overview of the HabEx telescope flight system that would advance astrophysical science in the same spirit as the Hubble Space Telescope well into this century.

The Multi-Mission RTG (MMRTG) used on Mars Science Laboratory is the most recent generator developed, and the only spaceflight-qualified system currently available. The enhanced Multi-Mission RTG (eMMRTG) would be an upgrade of the MMRTG using the most current thermoelectric (TE) technology, and would provide the space community with a system that would have substantially higher end-of-design-life (EODL) power. The NASA RPS Program recently instantiated an eMMRTG system development project, evolving from an ongoing technology maturation effort at JPL to a project designed to mature and transition the skutterudite (SKD) TE couples and technology into an operational RTG. The project has made significant advances in maturing SKD technology for use in the eMMRTG, and is looking ahead to potential RTG system development. Mini-module and couple life tests have produced substantial performance data that has helped refine the couple design and support lifetime performance predictions. Additional strength and thermoelectric properties tests have been performed to verify the design specifications and robustness of the candidate TE couples. Replacing the current MMRTG couples with SKD also necessitates system design changes that must be well understood. Recent systems engineering studies have focused on minimizing risk associated with updating the flight-proven MMRTG design. Upgrading the module insulation has been shown to result in 98% lower levels of CH4/H2 outgassing products. Performance analysis has been completed using the most recent TE couple sizes in order to understand the maximum acceptable power degradation rate to achieve the required eMMRTG power of 77 W at EODL. This paper provides an update on recent SKD technology maturation efforts and the results of several systems engineering tasks that continue to pave the way for successful system development.

S	McGarey, P; Reid, W; Nesnas, I			IEEE	McGarey, Patrick; Reid, William; Nesnas, Issa			Towards Articulated Mobility and Efficient Docking for the DuAxel Tethered Robot System	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			EXPLORATION	Sites of increasing interest for planetary science, such as craters, cold traps, and vents lie in terrains that are inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in collaboration with Caltech, is actively developing a tethered mobile robot, Axel, for traversing and exploring extremely steep terrain, such as Recurring Slope Lineae on Mars and vertical pits on the Moon. However, on Mars, where landing-site ellipses are large due to the presence of an atmosphere, Axel may need to traverse several kilometers from its lander untethered given its finite tether carrying capacity (similar to 300 m). This paper proposes a novel design for a hybrid mobility system that allows a pair of Axel rovers to dock, lock, and drive long distances as a four-wheeled, articulated steering vehicle. The design improves upon prior efforts to achieve DuAxel mobility by leveraging two actuated docking mechanisms attached on opposite ends of a central module to enable 'sit/stand' functionality; the prior DuAxel system was limited to skid steering, which was inefficient due to Axel's grouser-style, high-friction wheels. In the proposed system, the 'sit' configuration is achieved by aligning each dock parallel to the surface, allowing one Axel to detach and explore while the other remains docked and serves as a backup. While 'sitting', the central module rests on the ground and is outfitted with shovel-style wedges for passive anchoring to sandy terrain ( an optional drill can be integrated for anchoring to rock). In order to 'stand', the exploring Axel reattaches, locks, and both docks are rotated until Axel's tether caster arm is upright and the central module is lifted off the ground. Once upright, each Axel rotates about a pivot point for articulated, all-wheel steering, which is accomplished by applying differential wheel torques.

A Flight-Traceable Cryogenic Thermal System for Use in a Sample-Capture Flux-Pinned Interface	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			LEVITATION; FORCE; RECONFIGURATION; STIFFNESS; MAGNET	Flux-pinned interfaces for spacecraft have been studied for almost a decade for their dynamic properties that allow designers to shape the dynamic behavior of spacecraft relative to one another. However, the efficacy of these interfaces hinges on the requirement that the type-II superconductors in the interface first be cooled below their critical temperature in the presence of a magnetic field, then held below their critical temperature for the duration of the dynamic interaction. Ground-based research often relies on consumable liquid nitrogen to cool the superconductors, but little work has been published on a flight-traceable cryocooler-based solution to meet the thermal constraints. This work provides estimates of the mass, power, and performance of a system to facilitate trade studies for potential spacecraft applications. This paper details a thermal system designed to cool three 16 mm thick, 56 mm diameter Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide disks to below their critical temperature of 88 K for a ground-based testbed. Data collected on the device shows that it successfully provides the thermal environment required for the flux-pinned interface while consuming 105 W of power. A thermal model accurately predicts heat flows and temperatures in the device. This model applied to a space environment predicts a power consumption of 67 W in a space-flight device.

Planetary surface temperature range of -135C to +40C dictate that electronics packaging solutions provide resiliency to large thermal excursions to counteract mismatches in the coefficient of thermal expansion in the myriad of materials found within space born electronics. The Mars2020 Enhanced Engineering Cameras (EECAMs) are a collection of medium-and wide-angle cameras used across the Mar2020 Flight System. The EECAMs use a commercial off the shelf (COTS) image sensor [1] packaged in a 143-pin Ceramic Pin Grid Array (PGA). Early in the EECAM development, breadboard camera electronics that used conventional thru-hole soldering techniques was subjected to limited thermal cycling to investigate packaging survivability in Martian surface thermal environments from -135C to +70C. Functional testing following 2000 cycles showed that the detector was inoperable. Visual inspection of the part exhibited sever solder joint cracking in a substantial number of pins, and in some cases resulted in complete sheering of the pins from the ceramic package substrate. We will present the steps taken to derive the thermally-resilient electronics packaging design of the Mars2020 EECAM detector. We will highlight analyses and empirical test results that lead to a wide-temperature-survivable COTS component packaging design. Details of thermal cycle testing, in-process inspections, and final packaging design will be presented.

Automated Spacecraft Operations During Soil Moisture Active Passive Prime Mission	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Autonomy and automation of spacecraft operations have been long sought goals to reduce costs and risks. Many different approaches depending on the particular mission's needs and characteristics have been tried and taken. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is a science spacecraft mission measuring soil moisture, freeze/thaw and other parameters on a global scale, to support weather forecasting, disaster response and climate research. The spacecraft is fairly conventional and is in a sun synchronous near-polar low Earth orbit. The sole instrument is an L-band passive radiometer; the active radar component is currently inoperative. Automation is a characteristic feature of SMAP flight operations. The project practices "lights-out" operations, where the control room is not staffed, except for occasional real time or contingency activities. Operators nominally work only during regular business hours. Activities are planned and set up on a weekly cadence, and automated processes conduct data processing and commanding. Continuous downlink monitoring is enabled by a sophisticated notification architecture, along with weekly telemetry review by experts. A suite of tools and processes are used to implement the automation. Other tools and resources, while not strictly speaking automation, improve efficiency and reliability, which fundamentally achieve the same benefits as automation. As might be anticipated, there are challenges with a complex ground system that link together many disparate elements. On balance, spacecraft operational costs are estimated to be much lower than if the mission was flown in a conventional manner. In summary, the overwhelming majority of commanding during science phase are performed autonomously, without direct human intervention. A very low command error rate was achieved. It is proposed this concept of operations may serve as a useful model for future missions with similar characteristics.

[1] Mars 2020 will also demonstrate technologies needed to enable future human expeditions to Mars. Utilizing the groundbreaking entry, descent, and landing (EDL) architecture pioneered by the MSL, [2] [3] Mars 2020 will launch in July 2020 and land on Mars in February 2021. Like its predecessor, Mars 2020 will deliver its rover payload to the Martian surface through the use of Apollo-derived entry guidance, a 21.45 meter supersonic Disk-Gap-Band parachute, a Descent Stage powered by throttleable Mars lander engines, and the signature Sky Crane maneuver. While Mars 2020 inherits most of its EDL architecture, software, and hardware from the MSL, a number of changes have been made to correct deficiencies, improve performance, and increase the robustness of the system. For example, Mars 2020 will take advantage of the favorable atmospheric conditions of the 2020 launch opportunity to deliver a larger and more capable rover than has landed on Mars to date. A primary focus in developing the Mars 2020 EDL system has been mitigating residual risks identified after the landing of the MSL. The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiment (ASPIRE) was performed to address new concerns about the stresses experienced by parachute canopies during inflation. Other risk reduction activities include investigating possible interactions between the parachute deployment system and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) which could lead to IMU saturation, researching the effects of airborne dust on radar ground measurements, and site-specific gravity modeling for improved fuel usage. Several enhancements were added for Mars 2020 to improve performance. The addition of Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) allows the system to land at sites with more hazardous terrain, enabling scientists to select from locations which have previously been considered inaccessible. Mars 2020 will utilize a Range Trigger for initiating parachute deployment, which reduces landing ellipse sizes by 40% compared to the Velocity Trigger approach used on the MSL. New EDL Camera hardware will capture high resolution and high frame rate images and videos of key events, such as parachute deployment and rover touchdown. Finally, the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) sensor suite will build upon the successful MSL MEDLI experiment with the addition of heatshield pressure sensors tuned for the supersonic flight regime and backshell instrumentation. The team has faced new and unexpected challenges throughout development. Notably, the failure of the flight heatshield during a static load test has prompted the fabrication of a new unit. Also, in accommodating the first ever Mars Helicopter under the rover belly pan, the EDL design has been further constrained by reduced ground clearances. Despite these challenges, much of the EDL-related hardware and software have already been delivered, and the EDL verification and validation program is on track to be completed on schedule prior to launch in July 2020.

Ever since, the Moon has served as a "keystone" for understanding planetary geological processes throughout the Solar System. Like all samples that have been returned from the Moon, the Apollo 11 samples were collected from the lunar regolith, a layer of jumbled and pulverized rocks that blankets and obscures the Moon's bedrock geology. When geologists reconstruct the history of the Moon, these samples are like scattered puzzle pieces, each representing important information, but removed from the context of their formation and isolated from the bigger picture of how the Moon's crust was formed. The goal of Moon Diver is to return to Mare Tranquillitatis, taking advantage of the discovery of a natural pit cave entrance exposing a deep cross-section through both the lunar regolith as well as tens of meters of bedrock lava layers. Collecting information on the chemistry, mineralogy, and morphology of these intact bedrock layers would allow us to investigate where rocky crusts come from, how they are emplaced, and the process by which they are transformed into the regolith layer that we see from space. In doing so, the mission would combine the deep knowledge gained by Apollo with the unprecedented in situ access to secondary crust granted by the lunar mare pit to understand these fundamental processes on the Moon, and to use this knowledge as a keystone for understanding the same processes across the Solar System. The success of the Moon Diver concept hinges on accessing the subsurface. The existence of the mare pit provides a cross-section through the lunar maria. Access to the record exposed in the wall of this pit is provided by two critical space technologies: pinpoint landing (allowing the delivery of the payload close to the pit) and extreme terrain mobility (allowing the delivery of capable instruments to the cliff wall). Pinpoint landing is a closed-loop guidance and navigation capability that repeatedly matches visual features from a downward-facing camera to a priori acquired terrain maps. This body-relative navigation is then used with closed-loop control to guide the spacecraft toward its landing target, yielding a tight landing ellipse. Once on the surface, an extreme-terrain robotic explorer, called Axel, would egress from the lander and traverse tens of meters to the pit. The lander provides mechanical support, power and communication to the rover through its umbilical tether. Anchored to the lander, the two-wheeled, tail-dragger rover would pay out its tether as it traverses toward the pit. With the aid of its 300-meter tether, the rover can traverse the steep slopes of the pit funnel and rappel its vertical walls. The rover carries a surface preparation tool together with a suite of three instrument types: (a) a trio of high-resolution cameras (Mars 2020's EECAMs) for acquiring context images of the near and far walls with the near-wall pair in a stereoscopic configuration, (b) an alpha-particle-X-ray Spectrometer (MSL's APXS) for elemental composition, and (c) a multispectral microscopic imager (MMI) that uses controlled lighting for minerology. The surface-preparation tool removes dust and patina that may be present on the rock wall by grinding a small area. The surface-preparation tool, the MMI and the APXS would be deployed from their instrument bays in one of the wheel wells. The rover would independently point each of its instruments at the same target of interest on the wall with millimeter-level repeatability. Confidence in the technologies of pinpoint landing and extreme-terrain access is based on helicopter testing of terrain-relative navigation and field testing of extreme terrain mobility respectively. The latter was tested using Axel rover prototypes with integrated science instruments at multiple terrestrial analog sites including a basaltic pit in Arizona. Landing shortly after sunrise, the surface mission timeline is just shy of a lunar day (14 Earth days). Upon landing, the rover would egress from the lander, traverse toward the pit, descend along the pit funnel and rappel down its wall. Throughout its traverse, the rover would acquire multiple measurements of both regolith and mare layers. After descending to the bottom of the layers, the rover will reach a significant overhang. This void space may open into a large cave or lava tube, which could someday provide a protected location for a lunar base. For these reasons, lunar pits provide an exciting new target for lunar exploration.

Model-based fault diagnosis (MBFD) is an approach to estimating a spacecraft's health state by continuously verifying accurate behavior and diagnosing off-nominal behavior. Proper functioning of MBFD depends on 1) the quality of the diagnostic system model that is analyzed and compared to commands and onboard measurements to estimate a system's health state, and 2) the correct functionality of the diagnosis engine interrogating the model and comparing its analyses to observed system behavior. Our goal is to develop Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques for a MBFD system to provide the necessary confidence in its ability to estimate the health of on-board spacecraft components and systems accurately and precisely. Our effort is investigating two areas. First, we build on our previously-reported work in developing techniques for checking the correctness and completeness of MBFD systems. Second, we develop techniques for analyzing performance characteristics of MBFD systems (e.g., runtime, memory usage) to provide assurance that they will function within the resource-constrained environments found on spacecraft. This paper describes work we have done in both areas. For the first area, we describe our approach to developing formal definitions for a correct and complete fault diagnosis system, the application of those definitions to a systematic way of checking the correctness and completeness of a diagnostic model independently from the diagnosis engine, and the results of these checks. We also discuss the ways in which V&V techniques are related to our correctness and completeness checking techniques for a MBFD system development process. For the second area, we develop analytical expressions as functions of key parameters to estimate runtime/processing performance bounds. In parallel, we define various model structures (topologies) to enable parameterized testing to determine how specific parameters affect performance, providing a way to identify the significant contributors. These analyses lay the foundation for developing techniques and tests for evaluating false-positive and false-negative metrics, which are used to characterize MBFD diagnosis performance.

At present, models for mixed-signal components do not include significant temperature dependence, ADCs in particular. By developing comparatively generic models that are cold-capable, the ability to integrate mixed-signal parts into a larger system greatly increases. We have focused on Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) because of their widespread, critical usage in avionic subsystems and lack of available cold macro models. This paper provides an overview of testing and modeling of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) ADC across cryogenic temperature for the purposes of trend identification, performance prediction and reliability scoping with possible post-correction capability. The development of this model will hopefully permit greater integration of commercial components in larger avionics systems, decreasing development time while increasing flexibility of designers when trying to meet mission objectives.

Overview of the ASPIRE Project's Supersonic Flight Tests of a Strengthened DGB Parachute	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research Experiments (ASPIRE) project is aimed at developing and exercising a capability for testing supersonic parachutes at Mars-relevant conditions. The initial flights for ASPIRE were targeted as a risk-reduction activity for NASA's upcoming Mars2020 mission. For this effort, two candidate Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute designs were tested at Mach number and dynamic pressure conditions relevant to Mars2020. The two parachutes under investigation were a build-to-print version of the DGB used by the Mars Science Laboratory and a strengthened version of this parachute that has the same geometry but differs in materials and construction. The first flight test (SR01) of the build-to-print parachute took place on October 4, 2017, followed by the first test of the strengthened parachute during flight SR02 on March 31, 2018. A second test of the strengthened parachute with a higher target load, SR03, took place on September 7, 2018. During the SR02 test, a Terrier-Black Brant sounding rocket delivered a payload containing the packed 21.5-m parachute, the deployment mortar, and the ASPIRE instrumentation suite to a peak altitude of 54.8 km. As the payload descended back towards the Atlantic Ocean the strengthened parachute was mortar-deployed at a Mach number of 1.97 and a dynamic pressure of 670 Pa, and produced a peak load of 55.8 klbf. During the SR03 flight, the strengthened parachute was deployed from an identical test platform at a Mach number of 1.85 and a dynamic pressure of 932 Pa, and produced a peak force of 67.4 klbf. This paper describes ASPIRE's two sounding rocket flight tests of the strengthened parachute: SR02 and SR03. It provides an overview of flight operations, test conditions, the data acquired during testing, the techniques used for post-flight reconstruction, and the reconstructed performance of the test vehicle and parachute system for each flight.

A Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) concept for launching samples off of Mars, and delivering them to orbit for further transport to Earth may utilize hybrid propulsion due to the option's predicted favorable low temperature characteristics and high performance. However, the hybrid option is still undergoing technology development to demonstrate these benefits. Once development of a capable hybrid propulsion system is proven, further work will still be required. This will include environmental testing relative to the mission, and integration with the vehicle reaction control systems and payload. Qualification of such a system will be a significant effort. It will require specialized procurements for the propellants and environments involved, and further testing of the unique design. This paper details an estimate of the tasks required to complete development efforts from Technical Readiness Level 5 (TRL 5) through qualification. A success based program was formulated to reach the required performance metrics sufficient for a standard Preliminary Design Review (PDR). Using task level inputs from team members cost and schedule were conceived for continued progress to Critical Design Review (CDR), then through Qualification.

To date, this is the best pointing on a spacecraft of its size. This paper will analyze various aspects of the performance of its key piece of hardware-the payload. First, a model of the optics and imager, which is used to simulate stellar images, will be presented. The imager parameters used in this model were derived from simple ground measurements. Next, a centroiding algorithm is provided and used on the simulated images to predict centroiding performance. These results will be shown to match on-orbit telemetry of centroiding performance, validating the modeling approach. This paper will then describe an approach for and results of a geometric camera calibration algorithm to estimate the focal length, distortion, and alignment parameters. The modeling, analyses, and results presented in this paper provide key information that can be used in a time-domain pointing simulation or a frequency-domain pointing error analysis.

The motivation for this paper is to investigate methods to tailor the impact of safing events for spacecraft of different classes, destination, duration, and other categories of interest. Modeling spacecraft inoperability due to a spacecraft entering safe mode could enable mission planners to more effectively manage spacecraft margins and shape design and operations requirements during the conceptual design phase. This paper contributes to the area of safing event modeling by using available datasets to develop various distributions of frequency and recovery durations of safing events for interplanetary spacecraft missions. A safing event dataset compiled by JPL is first split into multiple subsets based on various mission classifiers. Using a previously developed mission simulation framework, a distribution of the likelihood of inoperability rates is computed through a Monte Carlo simulation. Three main safing event model types are formulated, implemented, and compared in this paper: a single Weibull distribution, a mixture of two Weibull distributions, and a Gaussian Process model. For each model type, two distributions are incorporated into the mission simulation framework: time-between-events and the recovery duration of a safing event. By specifying appropriate parameters in the mission simulation framework and Gaussian Process model, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted for a solar-electric Mars orbiter similar to the proposed Next Mars Orbiter. Mission implications from simulated outage times and safing events by each model could motivate greater operability, faster fault resolution by operations teams, and greater system margins. By incorporating Gaussian Process models into a mission simulation framework, a process is established by which historical mission data may be incorporated and used to model future safing events for interplanetary mission concepts. This enables mission planners to make more informed decisions during spacecraft development.

For flyby spacecraft to obtain accurate data during short windows with high relative velocities, target motion compensation is often required to preserve signal amplitude and prevent pixel smear. Effects of orbital determination errors, pointing accuracy error, and timing errors are exacerbated by use of target motion compensation to varying degrees. A Monte Carlo simulation was developed to determine trends in smear and required target motion capabilities for various flyby geometries, velocities, and exposure times for a selection of Jovian and Saturnian moons of exploratory interest. Case studies are presented for a range of potential missions and their simulation results compared to show variation in errors based on differences in input parameters. Results from the simulation can inform early choices in instrument and mission design, operations and mission planning.

The Probabilistic Asteroid Impact Risk (PAIR) software tool is currently being used to model the consequences associated with this natural hazard. Given that initial orbital solutions for a threatening asteroid are subject to uncertainties, the projected impact locations can cover a large area on the Earth's surface, called the impact corridor. The impact corridor not only provides information about the extent and general shape of the exposed area, but also represents a spatial projection of the impact probability distribution on the surface of the Earth. Spatial impact probability information is crucial for asteroid risk assessment, which combines impact consequences and impact probability. While PAIR is currently capable of estimating the impact consequences for a given impact scenario, including a probabilistic representation of the impact corridor will crucially extend its utility in asteroid risk analysis. Here, we present an approach to derive the impact corridor from an initial orbital solution that provides a position and velocity state vector in Cartesian coordinates with a corresponding covariance matrix. Using a Monte Carlo method, a finite set of impact points is generated by sampling the orbital solution state space and propagating the sampled orbits to the ground. The set of impact locations is subsequently used to construct the impact corridor in continuous form on the ground. An analytical or numerical approach may be used to construct the impact corridor from a set of impact points. The analytical approach requires fitting of a probability density function to the impact location set to determine a spatial impact probability distribution. On the other hand, the numerical approach estimates the spatial impact location density at each position in the affected area and scales this information to represent impact probability. The two schemes are compared for their practical applicability within the PAIR tool. The capability to calculate probabilistic impact corridors from orbital data within the PAIR model will enable it to support additional asteroid risk analysis applications, such as risk-informed design for mitigation missions or evaluation of civil response strategies.

The proposed platform would be able to achieve (a) multi-modal locomotion (fly and roll) for increased energy efficiency, (b) collision resiliency due to its impact-resistant structure, and (c) high-level of controllability due to three-dimensional actuation. This work focuses on the preliminary design trade-offs, analysis and feasibility assessment of the platform. First, a dynamic model of the robot that considers interaction with the ground is developed. Second, a control architecture for flying and rolling is proposed and evaluated in simulation. Finally, a discussion on the energy efficiency of the flying and rolling mobility modes via leveraging a derived dynamic model of the power consumption is provided.

To search for microbial life, 3-d imaging microscopes are needed that can efficiently search through sizeable liquid volumes for particles with signs of cellular structure and morphology, as well as to examine motilities. Our 3-d digital holographic microscopy approaches have been described earlier; that technique can provide sample amplitude and phase information across a volume. On the other hand, fluorescence imaging can provide complementary chemical information, and fluorescence light-field microscopy (FLFM) is an emerging approach to 3-d fluorescence imaging. Here we describe a 3-d FLFM imager concept, with the ultimate goal of combining both microscope types into a multi-mode microscope for lander instrument packages. Light-field imaging is a technique that can be used to refocus to different depths without mechanical refocusing. This technique generally results in lower resolution than standard imaging, but compensates with the ability to refocus to planes well beyond the normal depth of field. However, when imaging sparse, point-like fluorescent signals, or when simultaneous higher-resolution 3-d images of the entire field are available with a complementary 3-d microscope, such as, e.g., a digital holographic microscope, the finest spatial resolution may not be necessary for the light-field fluorescence microscope. In this paper, we first consider the parameters describing a light-field microscope, in order to be able to optimize them to our application. Refocusing to different sample planes is then modeled with a simple ray-trace algorithm. Our goal is to reach a suitable compromise between spatial resolution, field of view, and depth of field within a coincident volume of view for the fluorescence microscope and the digital holographic microscope. Even without the use of super-resolution techniques, lateral and axial resolutions on the order of several microns are possible, across a field of view on the order of a millimeter and a depth of field of a few tenths of a millimeter, both of which are comparable to the values obtained with our digital holographic microscopes. Finally, we describe a prototype fluorescent light-field microscope benchtop setup with which we have carried out initial laboratory demonstrations.

S	Sharma, P			IEEE	Sharma, Priyanka			Updates in Commissioning Timeline for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR)	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar Mission, or NISAR, is a multi-disciplinary Radar mission to make integrated measurements to understand the causes and consequences of land surface changes on Earth. NISAR will provide a means of disentangling and clarifying spatially and temporally complex phenomena on Earth, ranging from ecosystem disturbances, to ice sheet collapse and natural hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides. NISAR is a joint partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The NASA L-SAR and ISRO S-SAR Radar instruments will provide global and complementary datasets with a 12-day repeat cycle, for addressing compelling scientific questions in the fields of Solid Earth deformation, Ecosystems and Cryospheric sciences. The prime Science Phase for NISAR will be three years in duration. Prior to beginning the Science Phase, all the observatory elements, including the spacecraft bus, the Radar payload instruments, the JPL Engineering Payload and the Reflector Boom Assembly will be checked out during the In-Orbit Checkout or Commissioning Phase, which will last for 90 days after launch. During the Commissioning Phase, there will be a step-by-step buildup in capability to full observatory operations, starting with 'Initial Checkout', 'Reflector Boom Assembly Deployment,' 'Spacecraft Checkout' and finally 'Instrument Checkout'. Updates made to the NISAR Commissioning timeline in the Project's Phase C have focused on further refinement of the Instrument Checkout phase in particular. During this phase, both the L-SAR and S-SAR instruments will be powered on, their performance will be characterized and calibrated, initial calibrations will be performed to develop calibration strategies and demonstrate the instruments are 'calibratable' in the following 5 months of Science Calibration/Validation phase during nominal science operations. Initial power-on and calibration activities for L-SAR and S-SAR have been interleaved in the timeline. In addition, investigations of the ground processing activities (for example, data processing, data analysis, uplinks, downlinks) to be performed in between successive calibrations are currently underway. Allocating sufficient time for these ground-in-the-loop activities is critical to the development of a realistic timeline with a healthy margin.

Currently, many space missions are limited by memory capacity as there is not enough onboard memory to store the copious amounts of data obtained in a single space mission. Onboard memory systems must also be capable of providing the necessary operational robustness and fault tolerance based on system and mission requirements. Some mission requirements may include data-intensive operations such as terrain navigation, hazard detection and avoidance, autonomous planning, and onboard science data processing. Thus, space missions require onboard memory that has high bandwidth, high capacity, and high reliability to securely store recorded data when exposed to space radiation. To meet the aforementioned necessities, various designs of memory cubes that make use of horizontal integration of memory dies have been proposed. However, these methods require high design effort and a long lead time. Alternatively, a loaf-of-bread (LOB) design using vertical integration of DDR3 SDRAM dies has recently been proposed. Straightforward access to each individual die from the memory controller is possible in the LOB design due to the vertical integration of the dies which allows Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) dies to be used, reducing cost and lead time for designers. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively increase data storage for onboard memory while reducing the cost and effort that goes into design by presenting a 3D memory cube design utilizing 24 COTS NAND flash dies in a LOB configuration. The design includes various features that increase the data storage available while considering hazards specifically in space environments such as errors from single event effects (SEE) or single event functional interrupt (SEFI) events. Currently, the preliminary RTL code is ready with support for NAND Flash commands, error-correcting codes (ECC), and scrubbing. Features such as wear leveling, bad block management, data scrambling and a serial rapid IO (SRIO) interface to further mitigate errors due to radiation effects in the space environment will be incorporated in the future. The functionality of the memory controller has been verified via simulation of the RTL code. Further validation and testing using a FPGA board are also underway to verify the design at this stage. Therefore the proposed design addresses the need for increased memory storage while also allowing COTS dies to be used. This paves way for reduced design efforts as well as the incorporation of state-of-the-art memory dies in space missions.

Peter			Cryobotics: Extreme Cold Environment Testing of Strain Wave Gear Sets	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In designing and building equipment to operate in extreme environments, including cryogenic temperature conditions, realistic performance testing is essential. The technology focus area, cryobotics, concerns robotic systems and rotating machinery that must operate at cryogenic temperatures in environments that include Earth, low Earth orbit, Mars, Moon, asteroids, Solar orbit, planetary orbit, or those encountered during travel among these destinations. Another given aspect is that cryogenic temperatures (below about 150 K) will be encountered and must, therefore, be dealt with early in the design process. The heat transmission effects of these temperatures, as well as the large temperature differences (Delta T) and quick changes in temperatures (thermal transients), and thermal cycling must be understood by testing in relevant environments. Knowing what factors are more relevant than others is key to being able to come up with an adequate experimental approach and build an appropriate test apparatus. The applications include mining equipment, spacecraft mechanisms, rotating machinery for superconducting power generation, cryofuel pumping systems, and so forth. Participating with science and industry partners in tribology research, dry lube technology, and material science in a collaborative way is a key facet of the focus area of cryobotics. This paper addresses the design, checkout, and testing of an extreme cold environment test chamber and the initial testing of Harmonic Drive strain wave gear sets and bulk metallic glass flexsplines in strain wave gear sets. This chamber was specifically designed for testing actuator subsystems, such as planetary gearboxes, strain wave gear sets, and full actuators in vacuum and at approximately 100 kelvin (K) and below. This chamber's capabilities include life testing while under specific loads, gear efficiency, gear wear, temperature monitoring, and other operational parameters.

The Psyche mission will determine if (16) Psyche is the core of a larger differentiated body. As part of the development of this mission a Verification and Validation (V&V) engineer was assigned early in the project's design Phase B. This paper will discuss some of the strategies that the Psyche team is using to take full advantage of the early planning for V&V on flight projects and specifically how the Psyche mission is approaching these tasks. This paper will discuss the effects of having a V&V mindset on: 1) The Psyche requirements development process, and how focusing not only on how the team will verify these requirements but also on developing the tools necessary to track and monitor that verification feeds back into the requirement development process. 2) The Psyche testbed development, and how using a verification mindset is useful for identifying holes in the testbed development process, including the required testbed speed and how to think about testbed certification early in the process while encouraging trades and developing relationships with the testbed team. 3) Developing new V&V Tools for Psyche, and how developing tools early in the project development process means that they can influence the development of other requirement and scheduling tools. 4) Verification Activity Planning, which is typically done to a preliminary level during Phase B of the project, and is important for understanding the major testing that is needed to ensure that the system as built represents the design. On Psyche we are not only focused on bringing this planning to a preliminary level, we are also developing a V&V focused schedule to help us de-conflict V&V activities that may require similar resources early on in the program's development. 5) Validation Planning, for which we are working with the testbed and model development teams to ensure that their models can be effectively validated and that the plans to do so are in place. In this paper we will describe how the Psyche mission is approaching each of these V&V areas and identify lessons that can be taken by other space missions trying to decide how much effort should be put into V&V early in the project lifecycle.

Main objective of this mission is to gain more knowledge of the evolution of terrestrial planets. Beside a number of different scientific instruments onboard the lander, there are two instruments that will perform measurements on the Martian ground. One of the instruments is the Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), which was developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to measure the heat flow of the Martian outer crust. It uses a hammering mechanism equipped with heating foils on the outer hull for regolith thermal conductivity measurements and pulls a tether approx. 5 m into the soil. The tether is equipped with temperature elements for the determination of temperature gradients in the ground. There is the need of a separate system to be able to perform those activities on the surface. This system is called the "HP3 Support System". Its main task is to ensure a stable, nearly perpendicular position of the hammering mechanism relative to the soil on the Martian surface before initial penetration. It also houses the instrument for penetration depth measurement and serves as electrical connection to the lander. The paper gives an overview of the development and the qualification of the structure of the Support System. It will focus on the mechanical design, the analysis of the structural dynamics but in particular on the testing which includes standard environmental testing but also numerous development tests that are very mission specific. The mechanical design of the Support System is mainly driven by a unique set of requirements derived from the working environment on Mars, the deployment from the lander deck and the mechanically separated operation on the surface. The instrument design will be explained to show which design elements were implemented to ensure proper functionality. Various development tests were developed and performed to show compliance of the instrument design to the requirements. Such tests are: Separation Tests from the lander deck in cold environment under various tilt angles, Tether Deployment Tests, under various temperatures, foldings and routings, Feet Sliding Resistance Tests on sand with different slopes and the "Cold Drop and Dig test", which covers the initial hammering phase of the Mole. The paper will give an overview on all tests necessary for the support system qualification and will describe test setups and the results.

We utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and open source software to create a low-cost accessible platform for the potential use in commercial and research applications. The system is scalable, with the capability of swarm formation in both static and dynamic configurations using real-time path planning and optimized target assignment. The group of UAVs used in this study consists of multiple quadcopters, each equipped with an on-board computer, a flight controller, and COTS telemetry and GPS modules. Commands are sent to the swarm via a ground station. The ground station and UAVs communicate via a WiFi datalink. The system has demonstrated path-planning with collision avoidance capabilities through simulations. This study shows via simulation and partially through experimentation that swarm autonomy can be implemented effectively and cost-efficiently. This creates an ease of access for the use of a swarm of UAVs for a variety of applications including 3D mapping, and search and rescue across a variety of terrains with increasing difficulty. By integrating other sensors and instruments, this swarm can be used to measure a variety of parameters, locating targets and creating formations around them to best study the targets in areas where ground navigation and viewpoints are non-optimal.

An Ultra-Stable Mid-Infrared Sensor for the Detection of Bio-Signatures by Means of Transit Spectroscopy	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			PLANETS	The discovery of the Trappist-1 system, which consists of an ultra cool M-dwarf star orbited by 7 planets, 3 of which are located in the habitable zone, has demonstrated that these types of planetary systems around dwarf stars are very common. Such systems are well suited for the study of exoplanets. In particular the search for bio-signatures in the atmosphere of planets in the habitable zone around M-stars will be a high-priority science goal of future space missions. The mid-infrared (mid-IR) band between 3 and 15 microns is probably the best available band for this science, because the spectral lines of methane, ozone, and nitrous oxide can be found in this spectral range. he coexistence of these constituents in a planets atmosphere would be a very strong indicator for life on the planet. Mid-IR transit spectrometers on future space missions such as Origins Space Telescope (OST) will be the instrument of choice to detect these bio-signatures in exoplanets around M-dwarfs. Current mid-IR detectors are based on impurity band conduction (IBC) devices such as Si:As detectors. Charge trapping in these device leads to a time and exposure dependent response. As a result, this detector class is not expected to provide the required 5 ppm stability needed for a reliable detection of the aforementioned spectral lines. While efforts are under way to improve IBC detectors, it is un-clear how far the performance can be improved. Here we describe the development of an ultra-stable Mid-IR Array Spectrometer demonstration for Exoplanet Transits (MI-RASET), which includes a calibration system that, as we show, is needed to achieve the required sensitivity for the detection of atmospheric bio-signatures in habitable-zone planets around M-dwarfs. The spectrometer will be demonstrated with arrays of Transition Edge Sensor detectors (TES). These devices are known to have a very linear response and are intrinsically very stable. Furthermore, the required detector parameters (sensitivity, dynamic range) for space based mid-IR transit spectroscopy can be easily met with existing devices. No new detector developments are required, only the absorbers need to be optimized for the wavelength range of the instrument. This project will include the development of a high-accuracy calibration system with a stable reference source which itself will be monitored in the visible (0.5 mu m) by a photo diode. At this wavelength the precision of the load temperature measurement exceeds that of an in-band calibration. This scheme will allow for real time monitoring of the detector gain and offset, which we anticipate will result in a background limited performance with the required stability of better than 5 ppm for the detection of bio-signatures in a designated spectrometer flying e.g. on the OST space telescope, and as such will help to answer one of NASA's prime questions: "Are we alone?"

Mars Cube One (MarCO) is the first CubeSat mission developed for interplanetary operation. MarCO is a technology demonstration mission comprised of two identical, solar powered 6U satellites with several key goals, including that of providing a bent pipe telecom relay to Earth for NASA's InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission during its Entry, Descent, and Landing sequence. MarCO launched on the same rocket as InSight and makes use of the Deep Space Network for communications and ranging. It therefore has an attitude control system and propulsion system suitable for operating in several pointing modes, providing desaturations for reaction wheel momentum buildup, and thrusting to change the spacecraft trajectory. Because the spacecraft design is constrained to the CubeSat standards and because of the distances of the spacecraft from Earth and the Sun, the components used for attitude control and propulsion must meet tight size, mass, and power requirements. Autonomous modes of operation are also critical to ensure that the spacecraft can function safely with periods of several hours occurring between consecutive communication periods. A robust testing sequence was required to ensure that the spacecraft functions were exercised and that the operations team understood how the spacecraft were expected to behave after launch. This paper discusses several elements of the MarCO attitude control and propulsion systems. The paper begins with a discussion of the hardware that was selected for the two systems as well as descriptions of the interface between the attitude control and propulsion systems and the interface between these systems and the rest of the spacecraft's command and data handling system. Next, the paper summarizes the different types of tests that were performed at the system and spacecraft levels. Test data is included for some of these tests which helped define the methods by which the spacecraft is operated in space. Lastly, the paper lists a series of lessons-learned for developing attitude control and propulsion systems for interplanetary CubeSats.

InSight/MarCO Opportunistic Multiple Spacecraft Per Antenna (OMSPA) Demonstration	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				As smallsats become increasingly capable, longer-lived, and have more secondary payload launch opportunities to beyond-GEO destinations, they are expected to play an increasing role in deep space science investigations. This expectation is borne out by several relatively recent NASA Science Mission Directorate solicitations regarding smallsat studies and small innovative missions. With the potential for these smallsats to substantially add to the number of spacecraft operating in deep space, we need to be thinking about ways to support communications with all of them without the huge expense of trying to build a commensurate number of deep space antennas. One approach to this challenge might involve making greater use of beam-sharing techniques that allow all the spacecraft within the beamwidth of a single ground antenna to simultaneously downlink to the antenna. One of these techniques, Opportunistic Multiple Spacecraft Per Antenna (OMSPA), may be particularly suited to smallsats. In the concept for this technique, smallsats within the scheduled ground antenna beam of some other spacecraft, make opportunistic use of that spacecraft's beam by transmitting "open-loop" to a recorder associated with the antenna. These transmissions get captured on the recorder and can be later retrieved, demodulated, and decoded so that the smallsats can recover their data - all without them having to schedule the antenna itself and compete with larger missions for antenna time. Widespread use of such a technique could lead to more efficient use of receiver antenna resources and result in a dramatic increase in downlink throughput. An opportunity to demonstrate the technique occurred in May 2018, when the Mars CubeSat One (MarCO) mission, consisting of two nanospacecraft (MarCO-A & B) launched alongside InSight, a NASA Mars lander mission. To demonstrate the capabilities of OMSPA for this launch window opportunity, X-band downlink telemetry was recorded for all three spacecraft (InSight, MarCO-A, and MarCO-B) at both the Deep Space Network (DSN), using its 34-m antennas, and at Morehead State University (MSU) using its 21-m antenna - with all of the involved antennas pointed at InSight. Open-loop recordings were collected at the DSN using wideband very long baseline science receivers and at MSU using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices operated using GNU Radio. All the recordings were then processed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL) using an OMSPA Software Receiver, a signal processing/communications tool used to extract telemetry transfer frames from baseband samples. The results of extracting telemetry data from InSight/MarCO recordings collected by the DSN and at MSU are described in this article. In particular, details pertaining to the processing chain used by the OMSPA Software Receiver to demodulate the DSN and MSU recordings are presented, from carrier/symbol synchronization, to frame alignment using attached sync markers (ASMs), followed by error correction code decoding. Validation results with closed-loop data obtained by the DSN are also presented in order to highlight the viability of OMSPA for future multiple spacecraft demodulation opportunities.

X-band PN Delta DOR Signal Design and Implementation on the JPL Iris Transponder	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper describes the design and implementation of the Pseudorandom-Noise (PN) Delta Differential One-way Ranging (DDOR) signal format on the JPL Iris Cubesat Software Defined Radio. The Iris radio is now in-flight use in Deep Space onboard the MARCO spacecraft and will soon be utilized to multiple EM-1 missions. The spread spectrum Delta DOR format enables more accurate differential ranging measurements over the classical DOR tone format, and it is applicable to deep space missions that require accurate navigation or require accurate angular position measurements for another purpose such as determining the ephemeris of a planet or small body. The classical Delta-DOR technique makes time delay measurements of spacecraft and quasar signals to determine spacecraft angular position in the radio reference frame defined by the quasar coordinates. The measurement system is configured to provide common-mode error cancellation as nearly as possible. In the PN DOR mode, instead of a spacecraft modulating their downlink, with a sinusoidal signal, referred to as a DOR tone as done in the classical DOR mode, the sinusoidal tone is replaced with a spread spectrum signal. Using a spread spectrum DOR signal instead of a DOR tone enables cancellation of effects due to phase dispersion across the channels used to record quasar signals. This error source, referred to as phase dispersion or phase ripple, is currently the dominant measurement error for the classical DOR format. PN spreading will improve on classical DOR performance accuracy because by choosing the PN spreading code and shaping filter carefully, the spacecraft signal can be made to closely resemble the quasar signal resulting in reduction of the Delta-DOR error due to phase dispersion by 80% to 90% over the classical DDOR approach. The article will describe the choice of a Gold code sequence that possesses good autocorrelation properties as well as excellent cross-correlation properties that was used to spread the DOR tone, and the choice of root-raised-cosine (RRC) chip-shaping filter to reduce the amount of excess-bandwidth of the output waveform. The paper will also describe the path that was taken for the FPGA implementation on the Iris radio including a Simulink model of the PN DDOR module that is used for automatic HDL code generation. This module was then integrated into the Iris firmware and verified. Future work includes the integration of the designed subsystem into the Universal Space Transponder and extension of the derived waveform to the KA-band. We hope that the outlined PN DDOR implementation can be integrated into an upcoming mission that utilizes the Iris radio (such as EM-1 missions).

The concept of Titan Aerial Daughtercraft (TAD) was introduced in 2014, where small-scale (e.g. < 10 kg) VTOL aircraft would conduct multiple sorties from a mothership (lander or balloon), recharging batteries from a radioisotope power source (RPS) on the mothership between sorties. More recently, NASA has funded a study of a much larger Titan rotorcraft (similar to 450 kg) that would carry its own RPS. The TAD concept is still worth further analysis as a low-cost element of mission architectures where the mothership is a lander, balloon, or other large mobility system. To compare the potential performance of daughtercraft that are rotary-wing only or fixed/rotary-wing hybrids, this study examines potential flight durations and flight radius for small-scale (4 to 10 kg) quadcopters and tailsitters. For notional system parameters, a payload mass fraction of 25%, and a conservative battery model, energy estimation modeling for lander-based scenarios shows maximum flight endurance at Titan's surface for 10 kg quadcopter and tailsitter as 9.3 hours and 12.4 hours, respectively, and maximum sortie radius from a lander as 89 km and 125 km, respectively. Modeling of balloon-based scenarios estimated the mass potentially available for payload as a function of the total TAD mass and the float altitude of the balloon. For a balloon floating at 10 km above the surface and a 10 kg TAD, the model gave available mass of about 2.8 kg for a quadcopter and 3.5 kg for a tailsitter. Non-aerodynamic power dominates aerodynamic power at the lowest mass, but becomes a less significant fraction of the total as mass increases. The tailsitter has little or no advantage over the quadcopter at the lowest mass, but increasing advantage as mass increases.

High precision measurements with state-of-the-art equipment have achieved RV precision on the order of 0.5 m s(-1). Given that Earth's induced RV on the sun is on the order of 10 cm s(-1), this regime represents the next milestone on the path to finding Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars. We describe the Vacuum Extreme Radial Velocity Experiment (VERVE), a single mode fiber-fed high-resolution echelle spectrometer which integrates interferometry with spectroscopy with the aim of achieving RV precision at the 10 cm s(-1) level, on par with the ESPRESSO spectrograph (Pepe et al., 2014 [1]). The addition of interferometry relaxes the spectral calibration requirement by several orders of magnitude. We detail the spectral calibration of VERVE, including the development of a precise forward model and a data reduction pipeline to facilitate spectral extraction. We examine the model's agreement with the spectra of various calibration sources and present the results of spectral extractions performed on 635 nm and 780 nm laser sources to demonstrate VERVE's spectroscopic capabilities. We note the 10 cm s(-1) RV precision threshold for detecting Earth-like planets, and show that the similar to 2 pixel agreement we achieve is consistent with this requirement. We briefly introduce results pertaining to interferometry and conclude by describing the future stages of testing to prepare VERVE for novel RV measurements.

The current JVLA covers this frequency range employing five distinct receiver packages. We estimate that reducing the number of receiving systems required to cover the full frequency range should reduce operating costs. The receiver package we developed consists of a quad-ridge feed horn, low-noise amplifiers (LNA), and a down-converter to analog intermediate frequencies. Both the feedhorn and the LNA are cryogenically cooled. On the LNA front we pursued two 848 GHz MMIC designs, the first using 70-nm gallium arsenide, metamorphic high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMT), and the second using 35-nm indium phosphide HEMTs. In this paper, we report the measured gain and noise temperatures of these LNAs.

Omnidirectional Optical Communicator	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				We are developing an inter-satellite omnidirectional optical communicator (ISOC) that will enable cross-link communications between spacecraft at Gbps data rates over distances of up to thousands of kilometers in free space. The ISOC will allow superfast cross-links and will be a technology enabler for swarms and formation flying spacecraft. The ISOC under development features a truncated dodecahedron geometry that can hold an array of fast photodiode detectors and gimbal-less MEMS scanning mirrors. The main goals of the ISOC development include: 1) full sky coverage, 2) Gbps data rates and 3) the ability to maintain multiple simultaneous links. We have developed two omnidirectional communicator prototypes capable of full-duplex operation. We are using advanced single-mode laser diodes operating at 850 nm capable of producing hundreds of milliwatts of laser radiation. We are also employing MEMS-based beam steering mirrors, and fast PIN photodiodes to achieve long-range communications. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve full duplex operation at 1 Gbps data rates over 200 km and slightly lower data rates at longer distances. In this paper we describe the overall ISOC architecture and present the design tradeoffs for gigabit data-rate operation. We also present preliminary NRZ On-Off Keying communications simulation results obtained using our optical link budget model. The ISOC is ideally suited for crosslink communications among small spacecraft, especially for those forming a swarm and/or a constellation. Small spacecraft furnished with ISOC communications systems, should be able to communicate at gigabit per second rates over long distances. This data rate enhancement can allow real-time, global science measurements and/or ultra-high fidelity observations from tens or hundreds of Earth-orbiting satellites, or permit high-bandwidth, direct-to-earth communications for planetary missions.

S	Verma, V; Leger, C			IEEE	Verma, Vandi; Leger, Chris			SSim: NASA Mars Rover Robotics Flight Software Simulation	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Each new Mars rover has pursued increasingly richer science while tolerating a wider variety of environmental conditions and hardware degradation over longer mission operation duration. Sojourner operated for 83 sols (Martian days), Spirit for 2208 sols, and Opportunity is at 5111 sols, and Curiosity operation is ongoing at 2208 sols. To handle this increase in capability, the complexity of onboard flight software has increased. MSL (also known as Curiosity), uses more flight software lines of code than all previous missions to Mars combined, including both successes and failures[1]. MSL has more than 4,200 commands with as many as dozens of arguments, 54,000 parameters, and tens of thousands of additional state variables. A single high-level command may perform hours of configurable robotic arm and sampling behavior. Incorrect usage can result in the loss of an activity or the loss of the mission. Surface Simulation ("SSim") was developed to address the challenge of making full and effective use of many capabilities of MSL, while managing complexity and risk. SSim is software that performs rapid context sensitive simulation of flight software. NASA Mars missions are comprised of three phases: several months of Cruise, a brief but exciting Entry Descent and Landing (EDL), and a Surface mission that typically lasts as long as the hardware survives. SSim is meant for use during the surface phase when the mission fulfills its primary objectives. The focus of SSim on MSL was the robotic flight software, including rover mobility and navigation, robotic arm manipulation, and sample acquisition, processing, and delivery. It can execute behaviors in simulation a thousand times faster than they execute in real time on the flight compute element. SSim is used by rover drivers to develop and validate command sequences throughout the planning cycle. SSim has been used to plan all of the Curiosity robotic operations since landing and is expected to continue to be used for the remaining life of the rover. Due to the impact of SSim on MSL, the Mars 2020 mission plans to increase the scope of SSim during flight operations, simulating not only rover planner operations, but all surface operations, including the instrument, power, thermal and telecommunication behavior. SSim is part of the Rover Sequencing and Visualization (RSVP) suite of Rover Planning tools [2]. In the paper we provide an overview of SSim architecture, design, implementation, and usage on MSL, as well as an overview of plans for Mars 2020.

S	Verma, V; Kuhn, S			IEEE	Verma, Vandi; Kuhn, Stephen			Refactoring the Curiosity Rover's Sample Handling Architecture on Mars	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Curiosity Mars rover sample handling hardware and software were architected assuming that end-to-end sampling operations would occur in a single rover position, from acquisition of a powdered sample with a scoop or drill, through to the cleaning out of all sample residue in the sample chain. However, after analysis of the first drilled samples in Yellowknife Bay, the science team wanted to iterate with additional experiments on Mars and in laboratories on Earth to better understand their results and increase the value of science returned. With the architecture as conceived, the time needed to do so was in direct competition with the exploration of other targets and satisfaction of success criteria during the prime mission. The science team desired the capability to "cache" the sample for future use while continuing progress towards mission objectives by driving away and maintaining use of the robotic arm for contact science. Allowing sample to move about freely in this state risked hardware damage, ending the ability to deliver sample using the nominal path. In this paper we present the approaches that were developed to repurpose some of the sampling hardware into a series of caches and catchments that reduced this hardware risk to a level acceptable during the prime mission. This approach presented new challenges for rover planners, who had to learn to command the robotic arm using new routines that were too complicated to manage without assistance. The rover planner Software Simulation ("SSim") was updated to track the turret gravity vector and sample state, generating an execution error or breakpoint as constraints were violated. Sample from the Cumberland drill target was cached for over 9 months, facilitating a number of scientific discoveries. As data accumulated and the mission transitioned into extended operations, the cached sample capability evolved to significantly simplify operations and reduce overhead.

Recently, we introduced a two-way ranging method ([1], [2], [3]) which eliminates the need for the downlink PN ranging signal. In this telemetry ranging scheme, the requisite timing measurements are obtained from a data-bearing downlink telemetry signal. In the present paper, we extend the telemetry ranging concept by also eliminating the uplink PN signal, which is replaced by a data-bearing telecommand signal. We describe the architecture and concept of such a system, and describe the fundamental limitations of tracking the timing of uplink telecommand signals when demod-remod correlation techniques are employed via Cramer-Rao bounds. An end-to-end performance analysis shows that in typical scenarios, ranging performance comparable to conventional PN ranging can be achieved.

S	Waldram, N; Cornford, S; Piette, M; Plattsmier, G			IEEE	Waldram, Nicholas; Cornford, Steven; Piette, Marie; Plattsmier, George			Cross Lifecycle Modeling in MBSE	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Infusion and Modernization Initiative (MIAMI) is a NASA-wide effort to lay the groundwork for an integrated framework of tools and technology to advance the objectives of Systems Engineering at NASA, with emphasis on efficiency, interconnectivity, and breadth of scope. Within the MIAMI effort, the Sounding Rocket Team, led by George Plattsmier (MSFC) and George Turner (GSFC), has implemented MBSE within the domain of NASA Sounding Rocket Operations Contract (NSROC) Sounding Rocket missions, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to outline system architectures, requirements, mission assurance, stakeholders, events, and deliverables. The current team effort supports the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) experiment. The rocket team, focused on the mission planning and execution domain, is working in tandem with a MIAMI Sounding Rocket MaGIXS experiment team, focused on the experiment domain, to model the mission, systems, experiment, and interfaces to produce and deploy an integrated mission model. Through communication and coordination between NASA and the Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO), the MIAMI Sounding Rocket team is tailoring their pilot efforts to specific deliverables identified as critical throughout the full mission lifecycle by Nathan Empson (Mission Operations Manager) and others at SRPO. These products, as part of an overall NASA MBSE pilot effort, will enable evaluation of the utility of MBSE for sounding rocket missions. The team coordinates their work through a spiral development process punctuated by "sprints" to seam together the advancements in defining architecture and behavior of the systems involved, with the various technologies and analyses used to bolster the modeling effort. For developing technologies and modeling patterns, the team continues to interface with the Computer Aided Engineering Systems Environment (CAESE) team at JPL to explore and expand the system "model" from a MagicDraw server project to a nodal system of tools and services that delivers to stakeholders at various levels of cognizance. This environment is centered around an " authoritative source of truth", known as the Integrated Mission Model upon which several interfaces are integrated such that users throughout all regions of the model see data, commits, updates, and structural changes in real time for a better collaboration workspace throughout the project. In the current instance of this modeling network, the Integrated Mission model uses the individual MagicDraw models for the rocket team and the experiment team, where modelers commit up to the master model, and use synchronized checkouts and updates. This allows for better version control, user permission allocation, and support for distributed work efforts to improve collaborative efficiency. The current state and future state of the team effort is to appropriate the tools and libraries available to meet the desired use-cases requested by NSROC. Throughout the process of MBSE integration, the larger goal through MIAMI is to project high-level modeling concepts and implementations into useable and tractable deliverables for small missions. Additionally, through support and development of the model as applied to MaGIXS, re-usability is achieved so that the efficiency of modeling itself is improved.

However, digital holographic microscopy (DHM), a high-resolution, volumetric imaging technique that is well-suited for examining microbial species is typically monochromatic. Thus, the spectral properties of bacteria are not probed with DHM save only for the wavelength of operation. Here we describe a new DHM instrument which enhances the method via the simultaneous recording of wavelength multiplexed holograms of the sample. This coarse spectral encoding is akin to labeling with RGB values, thereby producing colorized images of the species which enables a new dimension of characterization. This new instrument is derived from a previous architecture which has already demonstrated superior opto/mechanical stability. Herein, this novel instrument is described, and the results of experimental measurements taken with this new instrument are shown.	[Wallace, J.

Categorized as a sub-orbital sounding rocket mission, the program is more risk tolerant than a typical JPL flight mission; thus more leeway is allowed in tailoring institutional requirements. However, since ASPIRE is a risk reduction activity for Mars 2020, its test results are significant to JPL and directly impact decisions for a flagship planetary mission. This, combined with the wide scope and complexity of ASPIRE - which spans multiple NASA sites, and includes distinct flight, ground, launch vehicle, and mission systems - creates unique programmatic challenges. Furthermore, as a program composed of multiple test missions, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the systems engineering approach between launches. As a result, the project has developed an adapted version of typical systems engineering functions such as verification and validation ( V&V), resource management, risk management, engineering change requests, and lifecycle management. A set of project guidelines has been established to accommodate the small team size, low budget, and higher risk posture of the project while also maintaining the highest possible chance of mission success and quality of engineering data products. This paper describes ASPIRE's unique approach to systems engineering functions, and evaluates successes and lessons learned.

In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is the exploitation of available resources at the site of a landed spacecraft on the surface of another planetary body. This can include harvesting of atmosphere, regolith, or rock for direct use (e.g. as radiation or micrometeorite shielding) or for separation/purification (e.g. for propellant production). The objective of this study is to try to identify a potential ISRU architecture, specifically for extracting water from hydrated minerals identified from orbital multispectral imaging on Mars, which can be implemented in an affordable way. By its nature this architecture must incorporate not only all the conventional excavate/scoop/haul/dump/process functions of a terrestrial mining operation on Earth, but also the sorts of maintenance and repair capabilities which any terrestrial mining operation would require in order to stay operational for an extended duration. The early concepts described in this study are intended for Mars, but also can be adaptable to lunar and other solar system planetary bodies.	[Wilcox, Brian H.; Nayar, Hari; Howe, A.

The third option may be the most attractive in terms of cost effectiveness and frequency of access, which are the main drawbacks of the first two, respectively. In the past 5 years, over 50 satellites have been launched from U.S. soil en route to geosynchronous orbit and beyond. Many of these launches do not use the full capability of the launch vehicle, leaving an opportunity for a small secondary spacecraft to get a ride to geosynchronous transfer orbit ( GTO). Starting from an ESPA-ring rideshare to GTO, a solar-electric propulsion ( SEP) powered spacecraft can make its own way to Mars orbit to perform a useful mission. In this paper, we explore the mission design space for small, ESPA-class ( 200-450 kg) spacecraft transferring from GTO to Mars orbit. This is accomplished by creating tools that jointly optimize low-thrust trajectories and spacecraft subsystems to create feasible mission concepts. An example is given of an Areostationary telecom orbiter that reaches Mars in 2 years with a dry mass of 200 kg.

We performed analysis on the relationship between bit error rate (BER) requirement, statistical characteristics of the received signal power and noise power, and the coded performance curves. We presented link analysis results with preliminary uncertainty quantifications of signal power and noise power. We used the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Serially Concatenated convolutionally coded Pulse Position Modulation (SCPPM) prototype software [1] to obtain coded performance curves under different operating conditions with varying signal power, background noise power, code rates, and PPM modulation orders. Comparison with traditional, deterministic analysis shows that extra margin needs to be reserved to compensate for the performance losses caused by uncertainties of the link parameters.

For flight mission and spacecraft design, reliable wireless systems will expand the scientific applications and research opportunities of planetary explorations. To retire key risks to use of wireless technologies in spacecraft design and space applications, in this research, we analyze its capability and propagation in the test and operational environments including thermal chamber and on-board of a rover at JPL Mars yard. The software-based wireless system consists a transmitting antenna, two receiving antennas, and a software defined radio, which enable one to transmit and receive multiple frequency band wireless signals with different modulations and a flexible data rate. Here, we summarize the signal propagation analysis of different test and operational scenarios. The propagation analysis demonstrates that the design of two receiving antennas provides about 20 dB improvement in the received power comparing to the single-antenna result. Additionally, the chamber test result shows significant multipath effects observed from the data collected from the two scenarios: 1) transmitting and receiving antennas are inside of the chamber, and 2) the inside-chamber receiving antennas receive signals from the outside-chamber transmitter. The statistical analysis of the Mars yard test indicates that signal power has relatively small standard deviation for the scenario in which transmitting and receiving antennas are aligned in the line of sight direction with a distance. The standard deviations increase for other scenarios that transmitter is set on rover's wheel, and receiving antennas are on the top of the rover probably due to multi-path effects. The investigation of propagation analysis will be beneficial to a design of a reliable wireless system toward the development of the spacecraft wireless networks in support of NASA's future flight missions (such as planetary aerobots, rovers, and spacecraft).

The systems consist of a set of type-II superconductors field cooled below their critical temperature using a cryocooler, and operate on an orbiting sample container with a series of permanent magnets spaced around the exterior, along with an integrated layer of shielding to preserve the magnetic properties of the returned samples. Benefits of the approaches include passive, non-contact capture and orientation, as well as a reduction in the number of actuators relative to various mechanical methods. System prototypes were developed, characterized, and tested in a microgravity environment to demonstrate feasibility. Flux pinning models were developed that accounts for magnet geometry, superconductor geometry, superconductor training geometry, superconductor temperature, superconductor material properties, and magnetic field shape, and output forces and torques the superconductors imparts on the OS via the magnets. Magnetic models of the OS were developed to evaluate magnetic shield effectiveness and demonstrate successful shielding of the sample. A vision system using AprilTag fiducials was used on a free-floating OS in a microgravity environment to estimate relative OS position and orientation while in motion. Integrated Capture, Containment, and Return System ( CCRS) Capture and Orient Module ( COM) payload concepts for an Earth Return Orbiter ( ERO) using flux pinning were proposed and assessed based on relevant system evaluation criteria, such as mass, actuator count, and power consumption.

This technology is an improvement over the technology that is currently used in space applications, which lags behind state-of-the-art commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment by several generations. MPSoC technology integrates all computational power required by next-generation space exploration science instruments onto a single chip. This paper describes the automation and the integration of hardware/software co-verification tools (LiveCheckHSI) for the Xilinx Zynq-based SoC control and data handling avionics system that have been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for next generation imaging spectrometers (NGIS). The NGIS acquires and compresses images in real-time, in addition to programming the spectrometer (frame rate, exposure time), focus step motor, and heaters and reporting telemetry. The SoC and MPSoC technologies combining heterogeneous supercomputing capability with high performance FPGAs allow for the integration of verification tools such as LiveCheckHSI into the deployment device itself. This approach allows to by-pass the traditional independent Ground Support Equipment (GSE) systems for acquisition, processing, and visualization of hyperspectral images which can be prohibitive in terms of hardware and software. This capability also permits on-chip verification for flight systems and extends embedded testing and verification tools beyond the pre-implementation formal verification and post-implementation such as VIVADO HardwareDebug /Chipscope with hardware in the loop.

Constraint-Based Off-Nominal Behavior Modeling for Europa Clipper	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The risk assessment for the Europa Clipper mission evaluates the probability of mission failure based on the failure rates of individual components and dependencies among them. The probabilities are calculated by integrating the failure probability density functions over the intervals of time within which a fault may occur. The response of the spacecraft to different faults can result in different schedules of activities, changing both the failure probability density functions and the time intervals of integration. This paper describes an approach to generating the schedules for the different fault cases and determining the associated time intervals. In order to represent the behavior of the spacecraft using a simple, declarative syntax, we employ a language based on ontologies of behavior and scenarios. A constraint-based analysis engine uses the declarative specification to identify bounds on system parameters and fill in details of behavior. These bounds include the time windows within which certain faults can occur, which are also the bounds for integration in the calculation of failure probability. Determining these time windows is a constraint optimization problem. For an individual fault in Clipper's propulsion subsystem, the engine is able to solve for values of the time window, but it cannot directly solve for the windows when they are functions of the times of previous faults. We used Mathematica to solve for these functions, and for more complicated scenarios, the functions are nearly too large to manage. We discuss this challenge of maintaining a closed-form calculation for more detailed fault models, and present the model of propulsion fault response behavior that illustrates the challenge. We also discuss some advantages of the behavior modeling language, comparing to a mixed integer-linear program model. Time windows are given for some of the many scenarios of interest.

Several unique advantages over traditional mechanical capture systems include robustness to control failures, contactless reorientation of the capture target, and collision mitigation. This study describes a series of experiments performed in a microgravity environment during a parabolic-flight campaign to measure the dynamic behavior of a flux-pinned interface in a flight-traceable environment. This paper presents the performance of a flux-pinned interface in the full six degrees of freedom in terms of several quantifiable metrics: success of capture at various energetic states, momentum change, system damping, and interface stiffness of the two spacecraft bodies.

Responses to interference competition vary, ranging from combat in dominant species to avoidance in submissive ones. Submissive species often show alternative strategies to avoid competition such as quick and efficient resource exploitation or shifts to less competitive resources. In the present study, we have evaluated the potential role of interference competition as driver of dietary specialisation in the mushroom-harvesting formicine ant Euprenolepis procera (EMERY, 1900). This ant harvests a broad spectrum of wild-growing mushroom fruiting bodies - an exceptional diet among ants. We asked whether competition avoidance for more typical ant diets could explain the high degree of dietary specialization in E. procera. In baiting experiments at the Ulu Gombak field station, Malaysia, we first showed that E. procera also utilizes alternative food sources (tuna and honey) demonstrating that mushroom-harvesting is not a hard-wired foraging strategy. In contrast to expectations, E. procera's competitive ability for these resources was relatively high compared with other ants in the community. In a second experiment, we offered three resources (honey, tuna, mushroom) simultaneously and close to each other in baiting stations. In the absence of other ants, all three resources were exploited at similarly high rates by E. procera workers. However, E. procera avoided foraging on tuna and honey baits when those baits were utilized by other ants. This context-dependent food choice behaviour in E. procera suggests that the exceptional dietary specialization on wild-growing mushrooms represents a case of competition-induced niche differentiation. Finally, we provide new data about the geographic distribution and about variability in seasonal dietary preferences of E. procera.

The ZTF utilizes the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope located at the Palomar Observatory. This telescope is equipped with a mosaic CCD camera that provides a field of view of 47 squared degrees. The allocated observing time of ZTF can be divided into partnership time (40%), public time (40%) and Caltech time (20%). The public time contains two surveys: a 3-day cadence for the Northern Sky Survey and a 1-day cadence for the Galactic Plane Survey. Astronomical communities in South East Asian countries are encouraged to explore the public ZTF data once it is released in March 2019. Taiwan's National Central University (NCU) is one of the partnered institutions, and a major ZTF-related project carried out at NCU is the ZTF Be stars variability (ZTF-BeV) program. The main goal of our program is to study the variability of Be stars in the range of similar to 13.5 to similar to 20.5 magnitudes.

We developed a template-free additive manufacturing (AM) process based on direct laser writing (DLW) that can create complex 3D architectures out of titania (TiO2) with similar to 100 nm resolution. In this process, we synthesize hybrid organic-inorganic materials that contain titanium clusters coordinated with acrylic ligands to prepare a photoresist that is amenable to two-photon lithography (TPL). We sculpt a pre-ceramic architecture using TPL and then pyrolyze in air at 900 degrees C to remove the organic constituents to produce a replica of the original structure with similar to 70% reduced linear dimensions. Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy confirm the constituent solid to consist predominantly out of rutile titania. We demonstrate this process by fabricating titania woodpile structures with lateral dimensions of 70 x 70 mu m and lateral periodicities between 1.0 and 1.3 mu m. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals passive tuning of the reflectance peak between 1.7 and 2.3 mu m, which agrees with Plane Wave Expansion simulations. This titania AM process offers a promising pathway to efficiently fabricate complex 3D nano-architectures out of a high-index material for 3D dielectric photonic crystals in the visible and the infrared.

Part of the planetary protection process would involve a process called "breaking the chain of contact (BTC)", where any returned material reaching Earth for further analysis would have to be sealed inside a container at extremely high confidence. The sterilization process would require destroying any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of the container. A novel process for containing returning samples has been conceived and is under development at JPL. The process consists of using induction heated brazing to synchronously sterilize, separate, seam and seal the container. The braze material is heated to the melting temperature that is higher than 500 degrees C and, thus, it assures sterilizing exposed areas since all carbon bonds are broken above this temperature. The container consists of double walls with "Earth clean" interstitial space. The process consists of two-steps, where one is intended to be prepared on Earth and the second would be executed on orbit around Mars. The latest results of this study will be described and discussed.

Ocean plates form at the ridge before cooling and thickening with age. This is supported by observations that include bathymetry and heat flow. Beneath older seafloor the observed age trend is more muted. Surface waves also find plate seismic velocity and thickness increasing with age, consistent with a cooling plate, possibly more muted at older ages. Teleseismic scattered waves find a discontinuity that increases in depth with age beneath young seafloor, flattening with a scatter-centered at 64 +/- 11 km depth beneath older seafloor. Active source reflections support low-velocity channels at similar depths. The discontinuity and channel depths are centered on the gradual velocity drops predicted for a cooling plate and also imaged by surface waves. The discontinuities implied by scattered waves are sharper than typically predicted for a thermal model. This suggests that although plate thickness is thermally controlled, another mechanism is required to define the base of ocean plates, such as melt. Anisotropic constraints are also important for our understanding of the plate, although precise depth resolution and links to defining the base of ocean plates are challenging.

However, observational evidence about their origin and evolution is still scarce. We report on the discovery of the first Box/Peanut (B/P) structure in an inner bar detected in the face-on galaxy NGC 1291. We use the integral field data obtained from the MUSE spectrograph within the TIMER project. The B/P structure is detected as bi-symmetric minima of the h(4) moment of the line-of-sight velocity distribution along the major axis of the inner bar, as expected from numerical simulations. Our observations demonstrate that inner bars can follow a similar evolutionary path as outer bars, undergoing buckling instabilities. They also suggest that inner bars are long-lived structures, thus imposing tight constraints to their possible formation mechanisms.

In waveguide-based devices, the light engine constitutes a significant portion of the total volume and weight. Dielectric metasurfaces have in recent years been used to demonstrate various high performance optical elements like blazed gratings and wide field of view lenses with small thicknesses, high efficiencies, and little stray light. Here, we report our work on the design of a compact light engine based on multi-metasurface optics with wide fields of view, integrated with three monochrome mu-LED displays for red, green, and blue. The metasurfaces image the mu-LEDs on the prism or grating couplers. This design avoids an important shortcoming of mu-LEDs and metasurface lenses, i.e., each work well for a single wavelength. As an example, we present a design for 532 nm, with over 3000 resolved angular points in an 8-mm-diameter field of view, and a total volume less than 0.65 cc (<2 cc for the three wavelengths). Limited by the total internal reflection region inside a waveguide with a 1.78 refractive index, the light engine can produce an image with over 1500x1500 points over a field of view slightly larger than 85 degrees x85 degrees in air. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal and demonstration of such a system and therefore opens the path towards exploring the potentials of the metasurface diffractive optics technology for compact AR headsets with enhanced optical capabilities.

In this paper: (1) the HiMAP design is illustrated and modeled using 3D polarization ray tracing calculus, (2) the dependency between the condition number of the systems polarization measurement matrix and properties of individual optical components is used as a method for tolerancing, and (3) the polarimeter capabilities of manufacturable thin film designs of polarizing and non-polarizing beam splitters is explored using numerical methods. The condition number of an optical system is calculated from a polarization ray tracing (PRT) matrix model of the polarimeter. Deviations of the condition number are calculated for non-ideal polarization elements and coatings to understand component and alignment tolerances.

Leveraging a tensor model for the scattering behavior, as opposed to a scalar model, enables the extraction of further information from the imaged objects. This is shown by means of frequency-diverse polarimetric imaging of complex objects, such as the letters of the word "DUKE", and comparing the reconstructed polarimetric images to the reflectivity-only reconstructions of the same objects.

Because of the enormous complexity, the first-principles numerical simulations under realistic input physics are strongly required to uncover the explosion mechanism, predict observational signals (neutrinos, gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves) and prove physical state in extremely hot and dense matter of supernova core. We have tackled the development of multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic code with full Boltzmann neutrino transport and performed several scientific CCSNe simulations in the last few years. In this article, we report the recent progress of our CCSNe numerical simulations with the most up-to-date equation-of-state (EOS) and nuclear weak interactions.

The methods do not assume any orbital knowledge of the target spacecraft, thus can be used for both quiescent and maneuvering spacecraft. We show by simulations that this approach can achieve meter-level three-dimension (3D) positioning accuracy with reasonable time delay measurement accuracy. The methods leverage on existing satellites and natural features (lunar case) with accurately known positions that can act as references, and/or in the case of the GEO places a dedicated "reference" spacecraft into an eccentric geosynchronous orbit over a region of interest (e.g., sky above North America). The ground antennas track the signals transmitted or reflected by the target and the reference spacecraft to measure their signals' time difference of arrival (TDOA). There are two modes of operations: "Single-differencing" - this approach assumes a transmitting radar illuminating both the reference and an uncooperative spacecraft (the target), and the ground radar antennas receiving the radar echoes to derive the relative position between the reference and the target. Double-differencing - this approach applies to the scenarios when either a) the target and/or the reference spacecraft with difference clocks transmitting one-way ranging signals to the ground, or b) multiple uplink radars are used to illuminate the reference and the target. We outline the mathematical derivations of the above schemes, and provide the accuracy performance simulations for some realistic and hypothetical scenarios. We also discuss some other applications.

We consider the problem of early classification of the hostile behavior of agents in a dynamic maritime domain and propose a solution using multinomial Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To enable early detection of hostile behaviors, the proposed approach encodes as observable symbols the rate of change (instead of static values) for parameters relevant to the task.

The attention to the 2017 Great American Eclipse provided multiple opportunities to share with audiences direct connections between a total solar eclipse and astrophysics concepts. We did this as members of NASA's Science Mission Directorate Science Activation program. In this article, we share how we leverage the excitement of the 2017 eclipse to connect audiences to astrophysics themes, primarily the concept of shadows, to describe how coronagraphs help us detect exoplanets via eclipses-on-demand, and the historical visual evidence of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. We also engage our audiences in the process of science, making use of several participatory tools, and share the science and resources with informal educators through professional learning opportunities and with the help of NASA subject matter experts.

J	Gardella, E; Kalantar, M; Lupini, M				Gardella, Eusebio; Kalantar, Mehrdad; Lupini, Martino			Model theory and Rokhlin dimension for compact quantum group actions	JOURNAL OF NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY			English	Article						C*-algebra; compact quantum group; quantum group action; Rokhlin property; Rokhlin dimension; logic for metric structures; axiomatizable class; positive existential embedding	C-ASTERISK-ALGEBRAS; ROHLIN PROPERTY; ELEMENTARY EQUIVALENCE; CROSSED-PRODUCTS	We show that, for a given compact or discrete quantum group G, the class of actions of G on C*-algebras is first-order axiomatizable in the logic for metric structures. As an application, we extend the notion of Rokhlin property for G-C*-algebras, introduced by Barlak, Szabo, and Voigt in the case when G is second-countable and coexact, to an arbitrary compact quantum group G. All the preservation and rigidity results for Rokhlin actions of second-countable coexact compact quantum groups are shown to hold in this general context. As a further application, we extend the notion of equivariant order zero dimension for equivariant *-homomorphisms, introduced in the classical setting by the first and third authors, to actions of compact quantum groups. This allows us to define the Rokhlin dimension of an action of a compact quantum group on a C*-algebra, recovering the Rokhlin property as Rokhlin dimension zero. We conclude by establishing a preservation result for finite nuclear dimension and finite decomposition rank when passing to fixed point algebras and crossed products by compact quantum group actions with finite Rokhlin dimension.

Electron beam test of the large area Mu2e calorimeter prototype	18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CALORIMETRY IN PARTICLE PHYSICS (CALOR2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Particle Physics (CALOR)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Univ Oregon, Ctr High Energy Phys, Eugene, OR		Univ Oregon, Ctr High Energy Phys			The Mu2e calorimeter consists of 1348 pure CsI crystals coupled to two large area UV-extended Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) organized in two separate annular disks. An intense R&D phase has been pursued to check if this configuration satisfies the Mu2e requirements. In May 2017, a dedicated test has been performed at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) in Frascati (Italy) where the large calorimeter prototype (Module-0) has been exposed to an electron beam in the energy range between 60 and 120 MeV. The prototype consists of 51 crystals, each one readout by two Mu2e SiPMs. We present results for timing and energy resolution both for electrons at normal incidence (0 degrees) and at a grazing impact angle (50 degrees) more similar to the experiment configuration. At 100 MeV, an energy resolution of 5.4% (7.4%) at normal (grazing) incidence has been achieved in good agreement with Monte Carlo expectation. In the same energy range, a time resolution of similar to XX ps (similar to YY ps) has been measured at normal incidence with 1 GHz (250 MHz) sampling rate. Dependence of time and energy resolutions as a function of beam energy and impinging angle are also presented.	[Atanov, N.; Baranov, V.; Budagov, J.; Davydov, Yu.

While radiation damage induced by ionization dose is well understood, investigations are on-going to understand radiation damage induced by hadrons, including both charged hadrons and neutrons. Aiming at understanding neutron induced radiation damage in fast inorganic scintillators, BaF2, LYSO/LFS and PWO crystals were irradiated at LANSCE by a combination of particles, including neutrons, protons and gamma-rays. The results indicate that LYSO/LFS and BaF2 crystal plates are radiation hard up to 4 x 10(15) fast neutrons/cm(2).

S	Lawhorn, J			IOP	Lawhorn, Jay		CMS HCAL Collaboration	New method of out-of-time energy subtraction for the CMS hadronic calorimeter	18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CALORIMETRY IN PARTICLE PHYSICS (CALOR2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Particle Physics (CALOR)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Univ Oregon, Ctr High Energy Phys, Eugene, OR		Univ Oregon, Ctr High Energy Phys			The CMS hadronic calorimeter employs plastic scintillator active material in the barrel and endcap (HBHE). In Run 2, the LHC operates at 13 TeV center-of-mass energy with up to 50 simultaneous collisions per bunch crossing (pileup) and a 25 ns bunch spacing. The HBHE scintillator light pulse is only 60% contained in a 25 ns window, resulting in significant pulse overlap for consecutive events (out-of-time pileup). This talk presents a novel algorithm that will be used in 2018 for subtracting out-of-time pileup in HBHE both online in the software trigger and offline. The algorithm includes methods for both the barrel with hybrid photodiode photosensors and QIE8 digitizers, and the endcap with silicon photomultipliers and QIE11 digitizers, including the challenging charge-dependent pulse shaping effects of the QIEs. The on-detector pulse shape measurement method and results are also shown. The new algorithm is five-to-ten times faster than the previous one, and for the first time CMS will use the offline method at the trigger level.

A new timing layer is designed to measure minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) with a time resolution of 30 ps and hermetic coverage up to a pseudo-rapidity of vertical bar eta vertical bar=3. This MIP Timing Detector (MTD) will consist of a central barrel region based on LYSO:Ce crystals read out with SiPMs and two end-caps instrumented with radiation-tolerant Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The precision time information from the MTD will reduce the effects of the high levels of pile-up expected at the HL-LHC and will bring new and unique capabilities to the CMS detector. The time information assigned to each track will enable the use of 4D-vertexing which will render a 5-fold pile-up reduction thus recovering the current conditions. Precision timing will also enable new time-based isolations and improved b-tagging algorithms. All of this translates into a 20% gain in effective luminosity when looking at di-Higgs boson events decaying to a pair of b -quarks and two photons. We present the current status and ongoing R&D of the MTD, including implications on the physics reach at the HL-LHC and test beam results.

WP-GITM was previously applied to simulate the ionospheric perturbations resulted from the epicentral crustal movement by assuming spherical acoustic-gravity waves originated from a point source, which was specified by the seismic measurement at a single location nearby the epicenter. In this work, we extend WP-GITM to include the effects of Rayleigh surface waves and adapt WP-GITM to utilize seismic measurements from more than one location in the attempt to capture the radiation pattern of the seismic source. We apply the new WP-GITM to model the near-field co-seismic ionospheric perturbations during the 16 September 2015 Illapel earthquake. The comparison between the simulated ionospheric total electron content perturbations and the GPS observations shows promising results.

However, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these materials are still not fully understood. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a powerful technique for the investigation of the transient structural dynamics of monolayers with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. The UED results of WSe2 monolayers are reported and the suppression of the intensity of the Bragg diffraction spots following laser excitation is attributed to electron-phonon and phonon-phonon scattering. A two-temperature model is used to accurately describe these dynamics due to the low thermal conduction of the monolayer. Furthermore, the reported lifetimes are fit using a single-mode relaxation time approximation.

The efficiency and radiation benefits enabled through the use GaN HEMTs in spaceflight conversion applications and the barriers to their use are discussed, along with a set of gate drive circuitry designed to mitigate overshoot and protect the device. Enabled by these technologies, the paper then presents three examples of GaN-based converters in flight applications and compares their merits to the current state of the art. This work represents a dramatic increase in efficiency and power density over the existing state of the art in power conversion for high-radiation environments, and will be used to provide high performance spacecraft systems.

Yet little is known about how individuals interact and reason with personalized predictions. To explore these questions, we developed a smartphone app, GlucOracle, that uses self-tracking data of individuals with type 2 diabetes to generate personalized forecasts for post-meal blood glucose levels. We pilot-tested GlucOracle with two populations: members of an online diabetes community, knowledgeable about diabetes and technologically savvy; and individuals from a low socio-economic status community, characterized by high prevalence of diabetes, low literacy, and limited experience with mobile apps. Individuals in both communities engaged with personal glucose forecasts and found them useful for adjusting immediate meal options, and planning future meals. However, the study raised new questions as to appropriate time, form, and focus of forecasts and suggested new research directions for personalized predictions in health.

The DSOC project, under development by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will test space-to-ground high-bandwidth laser communications while en route to the Psyche-16 asteroid in the main asteroid belt, in what will be the longest range high rate optical communications link in history. The LTA is based on a master-oscillator power-amplifier optical architecture, using highly-efficient cladding-pumped amplification. The transmitter is designed to deliver average optical output powers >4 W at 1550 nm for low power consumption data links at >100 Mbps. The output signal operates across multiple pulse-position modulation (PPM) orders and pulse-widths to optimize the space-to-ground link. The architecture is designed for high-reliability and radiation hardness, and features hardware interlocks and secondary signal/pumping paths to reduce single points of failure. We also detail the effective management of optical nonlinearities which could damage the LTA or impact the communications link. These include the suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering, self-phase modulation, and pulse-to-pulse energy variation (PEV), which arises from the gain dynamics of the power amplifier, and will manifest when the LTA is configured for large pulse energies and long inter-pulse delays. The LTA also incorporates hardware and software controls to enable autonomous operation, including closed-loop control of intra-stage and output power levels, modulator bias control, and detailed reporting of LTA status through telemetry.

Towards solid-state beam steering using a 7-emitter 1550 nm optical phased array	FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATIONS XXXI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Free-Space Laser Communications XXXI	FEB 04-06, 2019	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		coherent combination; optical phased array; FPGA		We present the preliminary design and experimental results of a 1550 nm solid-state beam pointing system based on an optical phased array (OPA) architecture. OPAs manipulate the distribution of optical power in the far-field by controlling the phase of individual emitters in an array. This allows OPAs to steer the beam in the far field without any mechanical components (e.g., steering mirrors). The beam-steering system presented here uses waveguide electro-optic modulators to actuate the phase of each element in a 7-emitter OPA, enabling kHz bandwidth steering with sub-milliradian pointing precision. The control system used to stabilize and control the phase of each emitter in the OPA exploits a technique called digitally enhanced heterodyne interferometry, allowing the phase of each emitter to be measured simultaneously at a single photodetector, dramatically simplifying the optical system. All digital signal processing is performed using a field-programmable gate-array. Applications of this technology include free-space link acquisition and tracking for satellite-to-satellite laser communications and light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

Students are drawn from one of two populations, which might have different type distributions. We assume that the employer at the end of the pipeline is rational, in the sense that it computes a posterior distribution on student type conditional on all information that it has available (college admissions, grades, and group membership), and makes a decision based on posterior expectation. We then study what kinds of fairness goals can be achieved by the college by setting its admissions rule and grading policy. For example, the college might have the goal of guaranteeing equal opportunity across populations: that the probability of passing through the pipeline and being hired by the employer should be independent of group membership, conditioned on type. Alternately, the college might have the goal of incentivizing the employer to have a group blind hiring rule. We show that both goals can be achieved when the college does not report grades. On the other hand, we show that under reasonable conditions, these goals are impossible to achieve even in isolation when the college uses an (even minimally) informative grading policy.

A population-level signaler has potentially noisy observations of a binary type for each member of a population and, based on this, produces a signal about each member. A decision-maker infers types from signals and accepts those individuals whose type is high in expectation. We assume the signaler of the disadvantaged population reveals her observations to the decision-maker, whereas the signaler of the advantaged population forms signals strategically. We study the expected utility of the populations as measured by the fraction of accepted members, as well as the false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). We first show the intuitive results that for a fixed environment, the advantaged population has higher expected utility, higher FPR, and lower FNR, than the disadvantaged one (despite having identical population quality), and that more accurate observations improve the expected utility of the advantaged population while harming that of the disadvantaged one. We next explore the introduction of a publicly-observable signal, such as a test score, as a potential intervention. Our main finding is that this natural intervention, intended to reduce the inequality between the populations' utilities, may actually exacerbate it in settings where observations and test scores are noisy.

However, ground observation networks are sparse, and snowpack models are often poorly-constrained by these observations. Spatially-continuous satellite data are available, yet only snow covered area (SCA) is easily monitored through this approach, despite the need for volumetric water content of the snow, or snow water equivalent. In this study, we investigate the potential to create spatially-continuous, computationally-efficient SWE maps that leverages in situ and remotely sensed snow information to improve understanding of spatial snowpack distribution across the West. A statistical model that integrates in situ and remotely-sensed snow disappearance observations for bias-corrected, spatially-continuous estimates of date of snow disappearance (DSD), with in situ peak SWE, distributed meteorology, and terrain data to produce a topographically-aware, annual estimate of peak SWE at a 500-m horizontal resolution. This lightweight, observationally-based snowpack model can be used to generate a high-resolution SWE dataset over large spatial areas useful for the development and validation of large-scale hydrologic models across the snow-dominated western U.S.	[Heldmyer, Aaron; Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Livneh, Ben] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, 450 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, 450 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah] NASA, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA	Heldmyer, A (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.

In this paper, we bring geometry processing to bear on manifold learning by introducing a new approach based on metric connection for generating a quasi-isometric, low-dimensional mapping from a sparse and irregular sampling of an arbitrary manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Geodesic distances of discrete paths over the input pointset are evaluated through parallel transport unfolding (PTU) to offer robustness to poor sampling and arbitrary topology. Our new geometric procedure exhibits the same strong resilience to noise as one of the staples of manifold learning, the Isomap algorithm, as it also exploits all pairwise geodesic distances to compute a low-dimensional embedding. While Isomap is limited to geodesically convex sampled domains, PTU does not suffer from this crippling limitation, resulting in an improved robustness to irregularity and voids in the sampling. Moreover, it involves only simple linear algebra, significantly improves the accuracy of all pairwise geodesic distance approximations, and has the same computational complexity as Isomap. Finally, we show that our connection-based distance estimation can be used for faster variants of Isomap, such as L-Isomap.

Our method consists of the offine and online stages. In the offine stage, we construct the localized multiscale data-driven stochastic basis functions by solving an optimization problem. In the online stage, using our basis functions, we can efficiently solve multiscale elliptic PDEs with random coefficients with relatively small computational costs. Therefore, our method is very efficient in solving target problems with many different force functions. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is also presented and has been verified by the numerical simulations.

Observations of Radio Magnetars with the Deep Space Network	ADVANCES IN ASTRONOMY			English	Article							TRANSIENT MAGNETAR; PULSAR; DISCOVERY; EMISSION; YOUNG	The Deep Space Network (DSN) is a worldwide array of radio telescopes which supports NASA's interplanetary spacecraft missions. When the DSN antennas are not communicating with spacecraft, they provide a valuable resource for performing observations of radio magnetars, searches for new pulsars at the Galactic Center, and additional pulsar-related studies. We describe the DSN's capabilities for carrying out these types of observations. We also present results from observations of three radio magnetars, PSR J1745-2900, PSR J1622-4950, and XTE J1810-197, and the transitional magnetar candidate, PSR J1119-6127, using the DSN radio telescopes near Canberra, Australia.

The formation of gullies on Mars today	MARTIAN GULLIES AND THEIR EARTH ANALOGUES	Geological Society Special Publication		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Martian Gullies - Martian Gullies and their Earth Analogues	JUN 20-21, 2016	Geol Soc London, London, ENGLAND		Geol Soc London		SUBLIMATION-DRIVEN ACTIVITY; DEBRIS-FLOW ACTIVITY; LONG-TERM EVOLUTION; MARTIAN GULLIES; LIQUID WATER; CO2 ICE; HIRISE OBSERVATIONS; GROUND ICE; DEPOSITS; CLIMATE	A decade of high-resolution monitoring has revealed extensive activity in fresh Martian gullies. Flows within the gullies are diverse: they can be relatively light, neutral or dark, colourful or bland, and range from superficial deposits to 10 m-scale topographic changes. We observed erosion and transport of material within gullies, new terraces, freshly eroded channel segments, migrating sinuous curves, channel abandonment, and lobate deposits. We also observed early stages of gully initiation, demonstrating that these processes are not merely modifying pre-existing land-forms. The timing of activity closely correlates with the presence of seasonal CO2 frost, so the current changes must be part of ongoing gully formation that is driven largely by its presence. We suggest that the cumulative effect of many flows erodes alcoves and channels, and builds lobate aprons, with no involvement of liquid water. Instead, flows may be fluidized by sublimation of entrained CO2 ice or other mechanisms. The frequent activity is likely to have erased any features dating from high-obliquity periods, so fresh gully geomorphology at middle and high latitudes is not evidence for past liquid water. CO2 ice-driven processes may have been important throughout Martian geological history and their deposits could exist in the rock record, perhaps resembling debris-flow sediments.

In some areas, a few hundred cubic metres of downslope sand movement have been observed, sometimes moving the dune brink 'backwards'. Based on morphological and activity-timing similarities of these north polar features to southern dune gullies, identifying the processes forming these features is likely to have relevance for understanding the general evolution/modification of dune gullies. To determine alcove-formation model constraints, we have surveyed seven dune fields, each over 1-4 Mars winters. Consistent with earlier reports, we found that alcove-formation activity occurs during the autumn-winter seasons, before or while the stable seasonal frost layer is deposited. We propose a new model in which alcove formation occurs during the autumn, and springtime sublimation activity then enhances the feature. Summertime winds blow sand into the new alcoves, erasing small alcoves over a few Mars years. Based on the observed rate of alcove erasure, we estimated the effective aeolian sand transport flux. From this, we proposed that alcove formation may account for 2-20% of the total sand movement within these dune fields.

Gully formation in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica: multiple sources of water, temporal sequence and relative importance in gully erosion and deposition processes	MARTIAN GULLIES AND THEIR EARTH ANALOGUES	Geological Society Special Publication		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Martian Gullies - Martian Gullies and their Earth Analogues	JUN 20-21, 2016	Geol Soc London, London, ENGLAND		Geol Soc London		SOUTHERN VICTORIA LAND; MIOCENE GLACIER ICE; TAYLOR VALLEY; MARS; CLIMATE; PERMAFROST; ECOSYSTEMS; EVOLUTION; DESERT; FLOWS	We report on a decade of fieldwork designed to determine the conditions required for erosion of Mars-like gully channels in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica. We have outlined the major factors in the morphological evolution of gullies in the Inland Mixed Zone of the MDV: (1) the distribution of ice sources; (2) the temporal aspects of ice melting; and (3) the relative significance of melting events in gullies. We show that significant erosion of gully channels can be achieved if geometrical and environmental conditions combine to concentrate ice where it can rapidly melt. In contrast, annual melting of surface ice and snow deposits during late-season discharge events contribute to transport of water, but flux rarely surpasses the infiltration capacity of the active layer. These small discharge events do not erode channels of significant width. Even when the flux is sufficient to carve a c. 10-20 cm deep channel during late summer (January-February) runoff, these small channels seldom persist through multiple seasons, because they are seasonally muted and filled with aeolian deposits. We briefly discuss the application of these results to the study of gully systems on Mars.

This is challenging since electrostimulation of cortical tissue typically causes strong artifacts that may saturate ultra-low power (ULP) analog front-ends of fully-implantable BCIs. To address this problem, we propose an efficient hardware-based method for artifact suppression that employs an auxiliary stimulator with polarity opposite to that of the primary stimulator. The feasibility of this method was explored first in simulations, and then experimentally with brain phantom tissue and electrocorticogram (ECoG) electrode grids. We find that the canceling stimulator can reduce stimulation artifacts below the saturation limit of a typical ULP front-end, while delivering only similar to 10% of the primary stimulator's voltage.

Spatially selective reversible charge carrier density tuning in WS2 monolayers via photochlorination	2D MATERIALS			English	Article						2D materials; transition metal dichalcogenides; tungsten disulfide; doping; photochemical chlorination; exciton binding energy	LIGHT-EMISSION; PHOTOLUMINESCENCE; MONO; DYNAMICS; EXCITONS; TRIONS; SHEETS; MOS2	Chlorine-doped tungsten disulfide monolayer (1L-WS2) with tunable charge carrier concentration has been realized by pulsed laser irradiation of the atomically thin lattice in a precursor gas atmosphere. This process gives rise to a systematic shift of the neutral exciton peak towards lower energies, indicating reduction of the crystal's electron density. The capability to progressively tune the carrier density upon variation of the exposure time is demonstrated; this indicates that the Fermi level shift is directly correlated to the respective electron density modulation due to the chlorine species. Notably, this electron withdrawing process enabled the determination of the trion binding energy of the intrinsic crystal, found to be as low as 20 meV, in accordance to theoretical predictions. At the same time, it is found that the effect can be reversed upon continuous wave laser scanning of the monolayer in air. Scanning auger microscopy (SAM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to link the actual charge carrier doping to the different chlorine configurations in the monolayer lattice. The spectroscopic analyses, complemented by density functional theory calculations, reveal that chlorine physisorption is responsible for the carrier density modulation induced by the pulsed laser photochemical reaction process. Such bidirectional control of the Fermi level, coupled with the capability offered by lasers to process at pre-selected locations, can be advantageously used for spatially resolved doping modulation in 1L-WS2 with micrometric resolution. This method can also be extended for the controllable doping of other TMD monolayers.	[Demeridou, I.; Paradisanos, I.; Germanis, S.; Pelekanos, N.

The alternative of CubeSat-based advanced infrared and microwave sounders for high impact weather forecasting	ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						OSSE; Cubesat; sounder; high-impact weather	ASSIMILATION; RADIANCE	The advanced infrared (IR) and microwave (MW) sounding systems have been providing atmospheric sounding information critical for nowcasting and improving weather forecasts through data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. In recent years, advanced IR and MW sounder systems are being proposed to be onboard CubeSats that are much more cost efficient than traditional satellite systems. An impact study using a regional Observing System Simulation Experiment on a local severe storm (LSS) was carried out to evaluate the alternative of using advanced MW and IR sounders for high-impact weather forecasting in mitigating the potential data gap of the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) or Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). It was found that either MicroMAS-2 or the CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) on a single CubeSat was able to provide a positive impact on the LSS forecast, and more CubeSats with increased data coverage yielded larger positive impacts. MicroMAS-2 has the potential to mitigate the loss of ATMS, and CIRAS the loss of CrIS, on SNPP or JPSS, especially when multiple CubeSats are launched. There are several approximations and limitations to the present study, but these represent efficiencies appropriate to the principal goal of the study gauging the relative values of these sensors.

Observing the corona and inner heliosphere with Parker Solar Probe	NUOVO CIMENTO C-COLLOQUIA AND COMMUNICATIONS IN PHYSICS			English	Article								The recently launched Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission is expected to provide unprecedented views of the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In addition to instruments devoted to taking measurements of the local solar wind, the spacecraft carries a visible imager: the Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe (WISPR). WISPR will take advantage of the proximity of the spacecraft to the Sun to perform local imaging of the near-Sun environment. WISPR will observe coronal structures at high spatial and time resolutions, although the observed plane-of-sky will rapidly change because of the fast transit at the perihelia. We present a concise description of the PSP mission, with particular regard to the WISPR instrument, discussing its main scientific goals, targets of observations, and outlining the possible synergies with current and upcoming space missions.

Following, we show a millimeter-wave spotlight imaging concept and its conceptual integration with the K-band system as interesting example of sensor fusion. We also demonstrate the application of computational frequency-diverse imaging for polarimetric imaging and phase retrieval problems. We show that using the concept of computational frequency-diverse imaging and quasi-random measurement bases, high-fidelity images of objects can be retrieved without the need for any mechanical scanning apparatus and phase shifting circuits. Increasing the frequency-band of operation, we also demonstrate a 340 GHz radar developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and its application for standoff detection. We demonstrate a new technique to characterize the point-spread-function (PSF) of radars operating at submillimeter-wave frequencies.

New Paradigms in Defining Optimum Cost Conditions in Thermoelectric Energy Recovery Designs	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	15th European Conference on Thermoelectrics (ECT)	SEP 25-27, 2017	Padua, ITALY	European Thermoelectr Soc, Italian Thermoelectric Assoc, INSTM, ICMATE Inst		Thermoelectric systems; energy recovery; cost analysis; cost-performannce optimization; heat exchanger effects		Cost is just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste heat recovery (WHR) thermoelectric generators (TEG). Prior work [1] has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e.g., the G [$/W] value) can be close to the designs that maximize power, but these design regimes are not necessarily aligned with high system conversion efficiency or power density. Recent work [2-5] further explores the impact of heat exchanger conditions on the optimum TEG fill factors and cost scaling of a waste heat recovery thermoelectric generator with a detailed treatment of the hot side exhaust heat exchanger. The cost scaling analysis considers the overall TEG system costs, including TE material costs, manufacturing costs, and specifically heat exchanger costs; and the performance analysis accounts for heat lost to the environment and updated relationships between the optimum hot-side and cold-side conductances that maximize power output. The optimum fill factor, F-opt, to minimize TEG energy recovery system costs is strongly dependent on the heat leakage fraction, sigma, the mass flow rate of the exhaust, the hot-side heat exchanger effectiveness, heat exchanger UA(u), and interfacial heat flux [1]. A more rigorous analysis and conclusion for the optimum fill factor was recently introduced and characterized at the 14th European Conference on Thermoelectrics [5] in 2016. A new, more comprehensive relationship for F-opt has created an updated, more rigorous relationship for the optimum cost, G(opt), relationship for thermoelectric energy recovery systems. These new [G(opt), F-opt] relationships are explored and characterized to show the inherent design complexities. The heat exchanger costs can often dominate the TEG cost equation and it is critical to fully understand the tradeoff between heat exchanger performance, TEG manufacturing and material costs, optimum TEG fill factors, and TE performance to establish potentially optimum design points within the cost-performance design space. This work explores and characterizes new design tradeoffs and new cost minimization relationships within this cost-performance design space for a typical thermoelectric energy recovery system application where the interplay between optimum TEG fill factors, TE device design parameters, and heat exchanger design parameters can impact system footprint, volume, and mass in weight-sensitive applications. This work shows how heat exchanger UAu, interfacial heat flux, and Fopt govern cost minimization and create and control cost regimes within the overall cost-performance design domain. This shift of emphasis acknowledging the interdependence of optimum TE fill factors, heat exchanger performance, and interfacial heat flux has significant implications on thermoelectric WHR system designs, their performance, and their operation.

Quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on measurement precision, called the Heisenberg limit, which can be achieved for noiseless quantum systems, but is not achievable in general for systems subject to noise. Here we study how measurement precision can be enhanced through quantum error correction, a general method for protecting a quantum system from the damaging effects of noise. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the Heisenberg limit using quantum probes subject to Markovian noise, assuming that noiseless ancilla systems are available, and that fast, accurate quantum processing can be performed. When the sufficient condition is satisfied, the quantum error-correcting code achieving the best possible precision can be found by solving a semidefinite program. We also show that noiseless ancilla are not needed when the signal Hamiltonian and the error operators commute. Finally we provide two explicit, archetypal examples of quantum sensors: qubits undergoing dephasing and a lossy bosonic mode.

Exploring new models for improving planetary rover operations efficiency through the 2016 CanMars Mars Sample Return (MSR) analogue deployment	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Mars; Rover; Analogue mission; Sample return; Mission operations	HABITABILITY	Approaches to rover mission operations were investigated in the framework of the CanMars Mars Sample Return (MSR) analogue mission deployments. Improving the efficiency of operations is a necessity for future planetary missions, including Mars 2020, which seek to combine sample targeting with in situ investigations in the fixed amount of time available in primary science operations and with increasingly high public and science community expectations for results. Analogue missions provide an important opportunity to experiment with mission operation strategies and learn lessons that can be incorporated in future missions. Improving the efficiency of operations was a key objective of the 2015 and 2016 CanMars mission deployment. The mission overall operations organisation for CanMars is described with comparison to current implementation of Mars Exploration Rover and Mars Science Laboratory missions. Approaches being tested included 3-sol plan sequences with increased use of waypoints for teach and return as part of a global Walkabout approach, use of Strategic Observation days to focus the Science Team's efforts, and consideration to improvements in how information is exchanged tactically and strategically in operations.

In the context of HRI, part of the world to be modeled is the human. One option is for the robot to treat the human as a black box and learn a policy for how they act directly. But it can also model the human as an agent, and rely on a "theory of mind" to guide or bias the learning (grey box). We contribute a characterization of the performance of these methods under the optimistic case of having an ideal theory of mind, as well as under different scenarios in which the assumptions behind the robot's theory of mind for the human are wrong, as they inevitably will be in practice. We find that there is a significant sample complexity advantage to theory of mind methods and that they are more robust to covariate shift, but that when enough interaction data is available, black box approaches eventually dominate.

J	Hendricks, TJ				Hendricks, Terry J.			Thermoelectric System Economics: Where the Laws of Thermoelectrics, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer and Economics Intersect	MRS ADVANCES			English	Article								Thermoelectric technology has key benefits and strengths in many terrestrial energy recovery applications. Thermoelectric system cost is a key factor governing final decisions on the use of thermoelectric energy recovery systems in all terrestrial applications; thus cost being just as important as power density or efficiency for the adoption of waste energy recovery (WER) thermoelectric generators (TEG). New integrated cost analysis / thermoelectric analysis approaches have now shown key relationships and interdependencies between overall TEG system costs, including TE material costs, manufacturing costs, and specifically heat exchanger costs; and the TE performance design metrics such as TE material properties, TE device design parameters, heat exchanger performance metrics such as hot-side and cold-side conductances and UA values, and hot side heat flux in achieving optimal TEG WER designs. These new approaches have led to a new thermoelectric system economics paradigm that strongly influences TEG cost and performance decisions. While prior work provided foundations for the latest cost scaling analysis / TE performance analysis, this new work offers new insights and understandings and provides the basis for new thermoelectric system economics. Optimum TEG system cost conditions can now be tied directly to the TE materials, TEG design parameters, and heat exchanger design parameters through critical non-dimensional analysis. The non-dimensional analysis and metrics show the TEG system cost and performance interdependencies and intercouplings in one unifying and cohesive relationship. Prior work by T.J. Hendricks, S.K. Yee, and S. LeBlanc, J of Electronic Mater, 45, (3 ) , 1751-1761, 2015 has shown that the system design that minimizes cost (e.g., the G [$/W] value) can be close to designs that maximize power, but these design regimes are not necessarily aligned with high system conversion efficiency or high specific power. Key sensitivities and interrelationships between critical cost metrics and critical TE performance and design metrics in the new thermoelectric system economics paradigm are explored. Quantitative data showing these sensitivities and their implications on TEG system design in terrestrial WER applications are presented. Critical non-dimensional parameter mapping has shown where heat exchanger cost-dominated conditions, TE material or manufacturing cost-dominated conditions, and combinations of cost conditions control and drive the overall TEG cost and performance. This new cost-performance paradigm shows the required pathways and challenges to achieving TEG system costs of $1-$3/W-elec.

To construct the BBGFL modal solutions, we derive governing equations of the linear eigen-matrix problem and orthonormalization condition. In BBGFL, the Green's function is represented in modal expansions with convergence accelerated by higher order low wavenumber extractions. To obtain a linear eigenvalue problem for the modes, we use two BBGFLs of rectangular waveguides with two dielectric wavenumbers. The orthonormalized mode functions are used to construct the Green's function. Current wavenumber derivatives and Green's function wavenumber derivatives are computed by a single low wavenumber MoM impedance matrix. The wavenumber derivatives are used to accelerate the convergence of modal summations to 6th order. Numerical results are illustrated and compared with the direct MoM method of using free space Green's function. Results show accuracies and computation efficiencies for broadband simulations of Green's functions.

Ocean angular momentum from a recent global state estimate, with assessment of uncertainties	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Earth rotation variations; Satellite geodesy; Satellite gravity; Sea level change; Time variable gravity	MODEL; EXCITATION	Earth rotation studies require accurate knowledge of the global oceanic velocity and mass fields, for proper accounting of ocean angular momentum (OAM) effects on the planetary budget. We analyse a new OAM series (1992-2015) based on the solution of a global general circulation model constrained to most existing ocean data. The impact of the data-constrained optimization on OAM is substantial, and particularly essential for calculating effects of global mean ocean mass changes, which can be important for determining annual cycles and long term trends in OAM. The contributions of sea ice to OAM variations, also estimated, are found to be negligible. Uncertainties in OAM series are assessed by comparison with other available estimates. Results indicate low signal-to-noise ratios for all the analysed OAM series. Comparisons with geodetic, atmospheric and hydrologic data, in the context of the planetary angular momentum budget, point to the continued need for improvements in some or all of the series. Possible paths are offered for producing better OAM estimates in the future.	[Quinn, K. J.; Ponte, R.

J	Hawthorne, JC; Thomas, AM; Ampuero, JP				Hawthorne, Jessica C.; Thomas, Amanda M.; Ampuero, Jean-Paul			The rupture extent of low frequency earthquakes near Parkfield, CA	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Transient deformation; Earthquake source observations; Rheology and friction of fault zones; Continental tectonics: strike-slip and transform	SAN-ANDREAS FAULT; THERMO-PORO-MECHANICS; NON-VOLCANIC TREMOR; SLOW SLIP; EPISODIC TREMOR; SOURCE PARAMETERS; FRICTIONAL-PROPERTIES; SUBDUCTION INTERFACE; SEISMIC EVIDENCE; ELASTIC FIELD	The low frequency earthquakes (LFEs) that constitute tectonic tremor are often inferred to be slow: to have durations of 0.2-0.5 s, a factor of 10-100 longer than those of typical M-W 1-2 earthquakes. Here we examine LFEs near Parkfield, CA in order to assess several proposed explanations for LFEs' long durations. We determine LFE rupture areas and location distributions using a new approach, similar to directivity analysis, where we examine how signals coming from various locations within LFEs' finite rupture extents create differences in the apparent source time functions recorded at various stations. We use synthetic ruptures to determine how much the LFE signals recorded at each station would be modified by spatial variations of the source-station traveltime within the rupture area given various possible rupture diameters, and then compare those synthetics with the data. Our synthetics show that the methodology can identify interstation variations created by heterogeneous slip distributions or complex rupture edges, and thus lets us estimate LFE rupture extents for unilateral or bilateral ruptures. To obtain robust estimates of the sources' similarity across stations, we stack signals from thousands of LFEs, using an empirical Green's function approach to isolate the LFEs' apparent source time functions from the path effects. Our analysis of LFEs in Parkfield implies that LFEs' apparent source time functions are similar across stations at frequencies up to 8-16 Hz, depending on the family. The interstation coherence observed at these relatively high frequencies, or short wavelengths (down to 0.2-0.5 km), suggest that LFEs in each of the seven families examined occur on asperities. They are clustered in patches with sub-1-km diameters. The individual LFEs' rupture diameters are estimated to be smaller than 1.1 km for all families, and smaller than 0.5 km and 1 km for the two shallowest families, which were previously found to have 0.2-s durations. Coupling the diameters with the durations suggests that it is possible to model these M-W 1-2 LFEs with earthquake-like rupture speeds: around 70 per cent of the shear wave speed. However, that rupture speed matches the data only at the edge of our uncertainty estimates for the family with highest coherence. The data for that family are better matched if LFEs have rupture velocities smaller than 40 per cent of the shear wave speed, or if LFEs have different rupture dynamics. They could have long rise times, contain composite sub-ruptures, or have slip distributions that persist from event to event.

Here, we developed two multimodality imaging systems which are integrated PA/US and integrated OCT/NIR fluorescence which can obtain layered architecture and vasculature simultaneously. In vivo imaging of rectum wall from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with these two imaging systems were demonstrated. Both imaging systems enable the use of one imaging probe for performing two different imaging, thereby improving prognosis by early detection and reducing costs. For integrated PA/US, the architectural morphology and vasculature of the rectum wall were visualized without the usage of contrast agent, but slow imaging speed and usage of match medium are the main limitations for clinical translation. With regard to the integrated OCT/NIR fluorescence, it is able to perform high speed imaging, however the addition of contrast agent and limited imaging depth are the main concern for clinical application.

The NASA Roadmap to Ocean Worlds	ASTROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Roadmap; Enceladus; Titan; Europa; Triton; NASA	SUBSURFACE OCEAN; ICE SHELL; EUROPA; WATER; ENCELADUS; SATELLITES; EVOLUTION; INTERIOR; PLANETS; CONSTRAINTS	In this article, we summarize the work of the NASA Outer Planets Assessment Group (OPAG) Roadmaps to Ocean Worlds (ROW) group. The aim of this group is to assemble the scientific framework that will guide the exploration of ocean worlds, and to identify and prioritize science objectives for ocean worlds over the next several decades. The overarching goal of an Ocean Worlds exploration program as defined by ROW is to "identify ocean worlds, characterize their oceans, evaluate their habitability, search for life, and ultimately understand any life we find." The ROW team supports the creation of an exploration program that studies the full spectrum of ocean worlds, that is, not just the exploration of known ocean worlds such as Europa but candidate ocean worlds such as Triton as well. The ROW team finds that the confirmed ocean worlds Enceladus, Titan, and Europa are the highest priority bodies to target in the near term to address ROW goals. Triton is the highest priority candidate ocean world to target in the near term. A major finding of this study is that, to map out a coherent Ocean Worlds Program, significant input is required from studies here on Earth; rigorous Research and Analysis studies are called for to enable some future ocean worlds missions to be thoughtfully planned and undertaken. A second finding is that progress needs to be made in the area of collaborations between Earth ocean scientists and extraterrestrial ocean scientists.

Ultrastable environment control for the NEID spectrometer: design and performance demonstration	JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						spectrometers; radial velocities; vacuum systems; temperature control		Two key areas of emphasis in contemporary experimental exoplanet science are the detailed characterization of transiting terrestrial planets and the search for Earth analog planets to be targeted by future imaging missions. Both of these pursuits are dependent on an order-of-magnitude improvement in the measurement of stellar radial velocities (RV), setting a requirement on single-measurement instrumental uncertainty of order 10 cm/s. Achieving such extraordinary precision on a high-resolution spectrometer requires thermomechanically stabilizing the instrument to unprecedented levels. We describe the environment control system (ECS) of the NEID spectrometer, which will be commissioned on the 3.5-m WIYN Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in 2019, and has a performance specification of on-sky RV precision <50 cm/s. Because NEID's optical table and mounts are made from aluminum, which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion, sub-milliKelvin temperature control is especially critical. NEID inherits its ECS from that of the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF), but with modifications for improved performance and operation near room temperature. Our full-system stability test shows the NEID system exceeds the already impressive performance of HPF, maintaining vacuum pressures below 10(-6) Torr and a root mean square (RMS) temperature stability better than 0.4 mK over 30 days. Our ECS design is fully open-source; the design of our temperature-controlled vacuum chamber has already been made public, and here we release the electrical schematics for our custom temperature monitoring and control system.

However, given the extreme brightness ratio and small angular separation between planets and their host stars, the planet signal-to-noise ratio will likely be limited by the unwanted coupling of starlight into the fiber. To address this issue, we utilize a wavefront control loop and a deformable mirror to systematically reject starlight from the fiber by measuring what is transmitted through the fiber. The wavefront control algorithm is based on the formalism of electric field conjugation (EFC), which in our case accounts for the spatial mode selectivity of the fiber. This is achieved by using a control output that is the overlap integral of the electric field with the fundamental mode of a single-mode fiber. This quantity can be estimated by pairwise image plane probes injected using a deformable mirror. We present simulation and laboratory results that demonstrate our approach offers a significant improvement in starlight suppression through the fiber relative to a conventional EFC controller. With our experimental setup, which provides an initial normalized intensity of 3 x 10(-4) in the fiber at an angular separation of 4 lambda/D, we obtain a final normalized intensity of 3 x 10(-6) in monochromatic light at lambda = 635 nm through the fiber (100x suppression factor) and 2 x 10(-5) in Delta lambda/lambda = 8% broadband light about lambda = 625 nm (10x suppression factor). The fiber-based approach improves the sensitivity of spectral measurements at high contrast and may serve as an integral part of future space-based exoplanet imaging missions as well as ground-based instruments.

On choosing state variables for piecewise-smooth dynamical system simulations	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Restoring force model; Bilinear hysteresis model; Bouc-Wen model; BWBN model; Hybrid dynamical system; State event location algorithm; Bond graph theory; Flow-controlled system; Effort-controlled system	RANDOM VIBRATION; IDENTIFICATION	Choosing state variables in a state-space representation of a nonlinear dynamical system is a nonunique procedure for a given input-output relationship and therefore a potentially challenging task. It can be even more challenging when there are piecewise-defined restoring forces, as in bilinear hysteresis or Bouc-Wen models, which are just two of many such engineering mechanics models. Using various piecewise-smooth models, we make use of flow- and effort-controlled system concepts, common to bond graph theory, to initiate our state variable selection task, and we view numerical simulation as being within the framework of hybrid dynamical systems. In order to develop accurate and efficient time integration, we incorporate MATLAB's state event location algorithm, which is a mathematically sound numerical solver that deserves to be better known in the engineering mechanics community. We show that different choices of state variables can affect state event implementation, which in turn can significantly affect accuracy and efficiency, as judged by tolerance proportionality and work-accuracy diagrams. Programming details of state event location are included to facilitate application to other models involving piecewise-defined restoring forces. In particular, one version of the Bouc-Wen-Baber-Noori (BWBN) class of models is implemented as a demonstration.

Achromatization method for multichannel fluorescence imaging systems	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fluorescence microscopy; optical design and fabrication; medical optics and biotechnology; diagnostic instrumentation	POINT	An achromatization method optimized for dual-channel imaging is developed. Dichroic mirrors are employed to split and recombine narrowband signals, and separation between catoptric components is used to minimize the longitudinal chromatic shift. An achromatic system based on this principle could be built from singlet lenses, since refractive element properties such as dispersion and power are not utilized to optimize wavelength-dependent performance. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed solution, a prototype miniature fluorescence microscope optimized for two emission lines of acridine orange (525 and 650 nm) is built. To reduce the cost and accelerate assembly, the system is built from commercially available optical components. The optical train consisted of two plastic singlet lenses combined with a pair of dichroic mirrors. Optical performance of the prototype is evaluated by imaging a bar line target at both design wavelengths. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed design strategy, the achromatic system prototype is used to measure a two-part white blood cells differential count on a venous blood sample. Data from the prototype fluorescence microscope are compared against results from a commercially available blood analyzer, and the difference between both instruments is within 20%.

An equation for cloud-base height tendency isolates the individual cloud-modulating mechanisms that control the evolution of boundary-layer liquid-water static energy (S-1) and total water mixing ratio (qT). With a suitable spin-up procedure, the control simulation performs admirably compared with observed estimates of liquid water content, vertical velocity variance, and radiative fluxes sampled during an aircraft field campaign. Investigation of the cloud response to various environmental forcing scenarios was addressed through a suite of sensitivity simulations, including variations in subsidence velocity, surface fluxes, wind shear near the inversion, and radiative forcing. In the control simulation, rising cloud-base tendencies are associated with entrainment warming/drying and short-wave absorption, whereas lowering cloud-base tendencies are driven by long-wave cooling. Even in the presence of substantial afternoon solar heating, entrainment fluxes remained active. The thin cloud demonstrated unexpected resiliency, with mixed-layer analysis indicating that, as the short-wave flux decreases later in the afternoon, the relative contribution of long-wave cooling often becomes large enough to offset entrainment warming/drying and result in a reversal of cloud-base tendency. The evolution of cloud-base tendency is found to be insensitive to the net radiative flux divergence for most of the simulations (liquid water path ranging from similar to 10-50 g/m(2)). Error analysis in comparison with LES S-1 and qT budgets suggests that our method of entrainment flux calculation could be improved by a more complete understanding of entrainment-layer physics.

J	Banuti, DT				Banuti, Daniel T.			The Latent Heat of Supercritical Fluids	PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pseudoboiling; Widom line; supercritical; transcritical; phase transition	WIDOM-LINE; TRANSITION; DENSITY	The article discusses the notion of a supercritical latent heat during 'pseudoboiling': Experimental, numerical, and theoretical evidence show that the supercritical state space is not homogeneous, but can be divided into liquid-like and gas-like domains, separated by an extension to the coexistence line - the Widom line. The key concept are two limit states of ideal liquid and ideal gas, characterized by constant heat capacities, and analyze the transition between them. Then, analogous to subcritical vaporization, a supercritical state transition from liquid to gaseous overcomes intermolecular attractive forces, albeit over a finite temperature interval rather than at an equilibrium temperature. This distributed latent heat is in fact approximately invariant with respect to pressure for (0 < p < 3p(cr)) and is thus valid at subcritical and supercritical conditions. This view also changes the perspective on subcritical latent heat: while it is an accurate representation of the required energy at very low pressures, the contribution of the distributed latent heat dominates the equilibrium latent heat as the critical pressure is approached.

We exploit the well-conditioned property of every decomposition component by integrating the multiresolution framework into the implicitly restarted Lanczos method. We achieve this combination by proposing an extension-refinement iterative scheme, in which the intrinsic idea is to decompose the target spectrum into several segments such that the corresponding eigenproblem in each segment is well-conditioned.

Reappraisal of incentives ameliorates choking under pressure and is correlated with changes in the neural representations of incentives	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						choking; ventral striatum; skin conductance; reappraisal	PERFORMANCE DECREMENTS; EMOTION REGULATION; SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS; WORKING-MEMORY; REWARD; MODEL; ANTICIPATION; STRATEGIES; FRAGILITY; FMRI	It has been observed that the performing for high stakes can, paradoxically, lead to uncharacteristically poor performance. Here we investigate a novel approach to attenuating such choking under pressure by instructing participants performing a demanding motor task that rewards successful performance with a monetary gain, to reappraise this incentive as a monetary loss for unsuccessful performance. We show that when participants applied this simple strategy, choking was significantly reduced. This strategy also influenced participants neural and physiological activity. When participants reappraised the incentive as a potential monetary loss, the representation of the magnitude of the incentive in the ventral striatum Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal was attenuated. In addition, individual differences in the degree of attenuation of the neural response to incentive predicted the effectiveness of the reappraisal strategy in reducing choking. Furthermore, participants skin conductance changed in proportion to the magnitude of the incentive being played for, and was exaggerated on high incentive trials on which participants failed. Reappraisal of the incentive abolished this exaggerated skin conductance response. This represents the first experimental association of sympathetic arousal with choking. Taken together, these results suggest that reappraisal of the incentive is indeed a promising intervention for attenuating choking under pressure.

A 3D printed TE10 rectangular to TE01 circular waveguide transition for polymer waveguide characterization	2019 92ND ARFTG MICROWAVE MEASUREMENT CONFERENCE (ARFTG)			English	Proceedings Paper	92nd ARFTG Microwave Measurement Conference (ARFTG)	JAN 19-22, 2019	Orlando, FL	IEEE, MTT S, ARFTG		rectangular to circular transition; mode transducer; polymer waveguide; mm-wave	DESIGN	In this paper we present a copper plated 3D printed implementation of the Marie rectangular to circular wave-guide transition. The copper plated 3D printed structure allows to overcome machining limitation when dealing with curved surfaces, confining the signal propagation in air, thus avoiding losses from the printing polymers. waveguide flanges are employed at both the rectangular (WR-12) and circular port to perform a full TRL calibration when the transitions are used in a VNA environment. A step diameter taper is used on the circular port of the transition to facilitate testing of circular polymer waveguides of different diameters. Experimental characterization is carried out for multiple samples of polymer (i.e., Teflon) waveguides in the 65-90 GIlz range.

We consider a non-myopic version of Cournot competition, where each firm selects either profit maximization (as in the classical model) or revenue maximization (by masquerading as a firm with zero production costs). We consider many non-identical firms with linear demand functions and show existence of pure Nash equilibria, that simple dynamics will produce such an equilibrium, and that some natural dynamics converge within linear time. Furthermore, we compare the outcome of the non-myopic Cournot competition with that of the standard Cournot competition. Prices in the non-myopic game are lower and the firms, in total, produce more and have a lower aggregate utility. We also briefly consider a non-myopic version of Bertrand competition, and find that prices increase relative to the classical model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The backscattering ratio of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko dust coma as seen by OSIRIS onboard Rosetta	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						scattering; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric; comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	PHASE FUNCTION	Remote sensing observations of dust particles ejected from comets provide important hints on the intimate nature of the materials composing these primitive objects. The measurement of dust coma backscattering ratio, BSR, defined as the ratio of the reflectance at phase angle 0 degrees and 30 degrees, helps tuning theoretical models aimed at solving the inverse scattering problem deriving information on the nature of the ejected particles. The Rosetta/OSIRIS camera sampled the coma phase function of comet 67P, with four series acquired at low phase angles from 2015 January to 2016 May. We also added previously published data to our analysis to increase the temporal resolution of our findings. We measured a BSR in the range similar to [1.7-3.6], broader than the range found in literature from ground-based observations of other comets. We found that during the post-perihelion phase, the BSR is systematically larger than the classical cometary dust values only for nucleocentric distances smaller than similar to 100 km. We explain this trend in terms of a cloud of chunks orbiting the nucleus at distances <100 km ejected during perihelion and slowly collapsing on the nucleus over a few months because of the coma gas drag. This also implies that the threshold particle size for the dust phase function to become similar to the nucleus phase function is between 2.5 mm and 0.1 m, taking into account previous Rosetta findings.

Tracking the variable jets of V404 Cygni during its 2015 outburst	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; stars: individual (V404 Cygni, GS 2023+338); ISM: jets and outflows; radio continuum: stars; submillmetre: stars; X-rays: binaries	X-RAY BINARIES; TRANSIENT GS 2023+338; BROAD-BAND SPECTRUM; HARD STATE; SYNCHROTRON EMISSION; MULTIPLE EJECTIONS; RELATIVISTIC JETS; ACCRETION DISC; RADIO-EMISSION; MINI-OUTBURSTS	We present multi frequency monitoring observations of the black hole X-ray binary V404 Cygni throughout its 2015 June outburst. Our data set includes radio and mm/sub-mm photometry, taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, Arc-Minute MicroKelvin Imager Large Array, Sub-millimeter Array, James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, and the Northern Extended Millimetre Array, combined with publicly available infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray measurements. With these data, we report detailed diagnostics of the spectral and variability properties of the jet emission observed during different stages of this outburst. These diagnostics show that emission from discrete jet ejecta dominated the jet emission during the brightest stages of the outburst. We find that the ejecta became fainter, slower, less frequent, and less energetic, before the emission transitioned (over 1-2 d) to being dominated by a compact jet, as the outburst decayed towards quiescence. While the broad-band spectrum of this compact jet showed very little evolution throughout the outburst decay (with the optically thick to thin synchrotron jet spectral break residing in the near-infrared/optical bands; similar to 2-5 x 10(14) Hz), the emission still remained intermittently variable at mm/sub-mm frequencies. Additionally, we present a comparison between the radio jet emission throughout the 2015 and previous 1989 outbursts, confirming that the radio emission in the 2015 outburst decayed significantly faster than in 1989. Lastly, we detail our sub-mm observations taken during the 2015 December mini-outburst of V404 Cygni, which demonstrate that, similar to the main outburst, the source was likely launching jet ejecta during this short period of renewed activity.

A fast radio burst with a low dispersion measure	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods: data analysis; galaxies: statistics; radio continuum: transients	SKY SURVEY; GALAXY	Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond pulses of radio emission of seemingly extragalactic origin. More than 50 FRBs have now been detected, with only one seen to repeat. Here we present a new FRB discovery, FRB 110214, which was detected in the high-latitude portion of the high Time Resolution Universe South survey at the Parkes telescope. FRB 110214 has one of the lowest dispersion measures of any known FRB (DM = 168.8 +/- 0.5 pc cm(-3)), and was detected in two beams of the Parkes multibeam receiver. A triangulation of the burst origin on the sky identified three possible regions in the beam pattern where it may have originated, all in sidelobes of the primary detection beam. Depending on the true location of the burst the intrinsic fluence is estimated to fall in the range of 50-2000 Jy ms, making FRB 110214 one of the highest fluence FRBs detected with the Parkes telescope. No repeating pulses were seen in almost 100 h of follow-up observations with the Parkes telescope down to a limiting fluence of 0.3 Jy ms for a 2 ms pulse. Similar low DM, ultrabright FRBs may be detected in telescope sidelobes in the future, making careful modelling of multibeam instrument beam patterns of utmost importance for upcoming FRB surveys.

Tests of gravitational symmetries with pulsar binary J1713+0747	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; binaries: general; stars: neutron; pulsars: individual (PSR J1713+0747)	STRONG EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE; RELATIVISTIC GRAVITY; LORENTZ INVARIANCE; CONSERVATION-LAWS; SCALAR THEORIES; MASS; DENSITY; LIMITS; STARS	Symmetries play a fundamental role in modern theories of gravity. The strong equivalence principle (SEP) constitutes a collection of gravitational symmetries which are all implemented by general relativity. Alternative theories, however, are generally expected to violate some aspects of SEP. We test three aspects of SEP using observed change rates in the orbital period and eccentricity of binary pulsar J1713+0747: (1) the gravitational constant's constancy as part of locational invariance of gravitation; (2) the universality of free fall (UFF) for strongly self-gravitating bodies; (3) the post-Newtonian parameter to in gravitational Lorentz invariance. Based on the pulsar timing result of the combined data set from the North American Nanohertz Gravitational Observatory and the European Pulsar Timing Array, we find (G) over dot/G = (-0.1 +/- 0.9) x 10(-12) yr(-1) , which is weaker than Solar system limits, but applies for strongly self-gravitating objects. Furthermore, we obtain an improved test for a UFF violation by a strongly self-gravitating mass falling in the gravitational field of our Galaxy, with a limit of vertical bar Delta vertical bar< 0.002 (95 per cent C.L.). Finally, we derive an improved limit on the self-acceleration of a gravitationally bound rotating body, to a preferred reference frame in the Universe, with -3 x 10(-20) < <(alpha)over cap>(3) < 4 x 10(-20) (95 per cent C.L.). These results are based on direct UFF and (alpha) over cap (3 )tests using pulsar binaries, and they overcome various limitations of previous tests of this kind.

We constrained the rotation velocity for our kinematic sample in an ORELSE field, containing the SC1604 supercluster, by fitting high-resolution semi-analytical models to the data. We constructed the stellar-mass/B-band Tully-Fisher relation and found no dependence of the intrinsic scatter on both local and global environment. Moreover, we compared the stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio (M-*/M-d(ya)) of SC1604 galaxies to those residing in less dense local environment by leveraging data from the HR-COSMOS sample. We found that, at fixed stellar mass, SC1604 galaxies have similar to 30 per cent smaller dynamical masses on average. By comparing the distributions of the galaxy parameters that define M-dyn (i.e., circular velocity and the characteristic radius r(2)(.2)) between SC1604 and HR-COSMOS, we found that smaller dynamical masses are mostly caused by smaller r(2)(.2) for SC1604 galaxies. We also observed that SC1604 galaxies in general show similar to 20 per cent lower stellar specific angular momentum (j(*)) with respect to the HR-COSMOS sample. Adopting literature estimates for (1) the excess rate of galaxy-galaxy mergers in intermediate/high-density environments and (2) the average amount of j(*), loss per merger event, we investigated the possibility that galaxy mergers are mainly responsible for the loss of angular momentum in higher density environments.

These analyses differ in many aspects: the data sets, the shear and photometric redshift estimation algorithms, the theory model assumptions, and the inference pipelines. To assess the robustness of the existing cosmic shear results, we present in this paper a unified analysis of four of the recent cosmic shear surveys: the Deep Lens Survey (DLL), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SV), and the 450 deg(2) release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIDS-450). By using a unified pipeline, we show how the cosmological constraints are sensitive to the various details of the pipeline. We identify several analysis choices that can shift the cosmological constraints by a significant fraction of the uncertainties. For our fiducial analysis choice, considering a Gaussian covariance, conservative scale cuts, assuming no baryonic feedback contamination, identical cosmological parameter priors and intrinsic alignment treatments, we find the constraints (mean, 16 per cent and 84 per cent confidence intervals) on the parameter S-8 = sigma(8)(Omega(m)/0.3)(0.5) to be S-8 = 0.942(-0.045)(+0.046)(DLS), 0.657(-0.070)(+0.071)(CFHTLenS), 0.844(-0.061)(+0.062) (DES-SV), and 0.755(-0.049)(+0.048)(KiDS-450). From the goodness-of-fit and the Bayesian evidence ratio, we determine that amongst the four surveys, the two more recent surveys, DES-SV and KiDS-450, have acceptable goodness of fit and are consistent with each other. The combined constraints are S-8 = 0.790(-0.041)(+0.042), which is in good agreement with the first year of DES cosmic shear results and recent CMB constraints from the Planck satellite.

Seasonal changes in plant-water relations influence patterns of leaf display in Miombo woodlands: evidence of water conservative strategies	TREE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						hydraulic conductivity; leaf phenology; Miombo woodlands; plant-water relations; xylem safety margin	HYDRAULIC SAFETY MARGINS; DEVELOPING LEAVES; XYLEM CAVITATION; DRY FOREST; SOIL-WATER; PHENOLOGY; TREE; EMBOLISM; SAVANNA; STEM	Water availability has frequently been linked to seasonal leaf display in seasonally dry ecosystems, but there have been few ecohydrological investigations of this link. Miombo woodland is a dominant seasonally dry tropical forest ecosystem type in southern Africa; however, there are few data on the relationship between seasonal dynamics in plant-water relations and patterns of leaf display for Miombo woodland. Here we investigate this relationship among nine key Miombo woodland tree species differing in drought tolerance ability and leaf phenology. Results of this study showed that seasonal patterns of leaf phenology varied significantly with seasonal changes in stem water relations among the nine species. Leaf shedding coincided with the attainment of seasonal minimum stem water potential. Leaf flush occurred following xylem rehydration at the peak of the dry season suggesting that endogenous plant factors play a pivotal role in seasonal leaf display in this forest type. Drought-tolerant deciduous species suffered significantly higher seasonal losses in xylem hydraulic conductivity than the drought-intolerant semi-evergreen tree species (P < 0.05). There was a significant and positive correlation between species drought tolerance index and species' seasonal loss in hydraulic conductivity (P < 0.05), confirming the ecological role of long-distance xylem transport in this seasonally dry tropical forest. Our results reveal that water stress in seasonally dry tropical forests selects for water conservative traits that protect the vulnerable xylem transport system. Therefore, seasonal rhythms in xylem transport dictate patterns of leaf display in seasonally dry tropical forests.

Observations in the NIR are also crucial for our understanding of the origins and evolution of these events, further improving their cosmological utility. Any future experiments in the rest-frame NIR will require knowledge of the SN Ia NIR spectroscopic diversity, which is currently based on a small sample of observed spectra. Along with the accompanying paper, Phillips et al., we introduce the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), to follow-up nearby SNe Ia in both the optical and the NIR. In particular, this paper focuses on the CSP-II NIR spectroscopy program, describing the survey strategy, instrumental setups, data reduction, sample characteristics, and future analyses on the data set. In collaboration with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) Supernova Group, we obtained 661 NIR spectra of 157 SNe Ia. Within this sample, 451 NIR spectra of 90 SNe Ia have corresponding CSP-II follow-up light curves. Such a sample will allow detailed studies of the NIR spectroscopic properties of SNe Ia, providing a different perspective on the properties of the unburned material; the radioactive and stable nickel produced; progenitor magnetic fields; and searches for possible signatures of companion stars.

Chahine's rule, a widely cited heuristic for hydrogen adsorption, sets a maximum adsorptive uptake of 1 wt % hydrogen at 77 K per 500 m(2) of the adsorbent surface area. High-pressure hydrogen adsorption measurements in a Sieverts apparatus showed that PECONF-4 exceeds Chahine's rule by 50%. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of PECONF-4 was measured redundantly with nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide and found to be between 569 +/- 2 and 676 +/- 13 m(2) g(-1). Furthermore, hydrogen on PECONF-4 has a high heat of adsorption, in excess of 9 kJ mol(-1).

J	de Bodt, E; Cousin, JG; Roll, R				de Bodt, Eric; Cousin, Jean-Gabriel; Roll, Richard			Improved method for detecting acquirer fixed effects	JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE			English	Article						Mergers and acquisitions; Fixed effects; Attrition; Panel data	BAD BIDDERS; CORPORATE; MERGER; MARKET; MANAGERS; RETURNS; STYLE; FIRMS	Large merger and acquisition (M&A) samples feature the pervasive presence of repetitive acquirers. They offer an attractive empirical context for revealing the presence of acquirer fixed effects (permanent abnormal performance). But panel data M&A are quite heterogeneous; just a few acquirers undertake many M&As. Does this feature affect statistical inference? To investigate the issue, our study relies on simulations based on real data sets. The results suggest the existence of a bias, confirming suspicions reported in the extant literature about the validity of fixed-effect regression based statistics (R-square, adjusted R-square and fixed effects Fisher tests) used to detect the presence and significance of acquirer fixed effects. We introduce a new resampling method to detect acquirer fixed effects with attractive statistical properties (size and power) for samples of acquirers that complete at least five acquisitions. The proposed method confirms the presence of acquirer fixed effects but only for a marginal fraction of the acquirer population. This result is robust to endogenous attrition and varying time periods between successive transactions.

ML techniques are becoming increasingly widespread in seismology, with applications ranging from identifying unseen signals and patterns to extracting features that might improve our physical understanding. The survey of the applications in seismology presented here serves as a catalyst for further use of ML. Five research areas in seismology are surveyed in which ML classification, regression, clustering algorithms show promise: earthquake detection and phase picking, earthquake early warning (EEW), ground-motion prediction, seismic tomography, and earthquake geodesy. We conclude by discussing the need for a hybrid approach combining data-driven ML with traditional physical modeling.

Unlike strong-motion accelerometer recordings that are affected by baseline offsets during very strong shaking, GNSS data record displacement with fidelity down to 0 Hz. Unfortunately, fully processed GNSS waveform data are still scarce because of limited public availability and the highly technical nature of GNSS processing. In an effort to further the use and adoption of high-rate (HR) GNSS for earthquake seismology, ground-motion studies, and structural monitoring applications, we describe and make available a database of fully curated HR-GNSS displacement waveforms for significant earthquakes. We include data from HR-GNSS networks at near-source to regional distances (1-1000 km) for 29 earthquakes between M-w 6.0 and 9.0 worldwide. As a demonstration of the utility of this dataset, we model the magnitude scaling properties of peak ground displacements (PGDs) for these events. In addition to tripling the number of earthquakes used in previous PGD scaling studies, the number of data points over a range of distances and magnitudes is dramatically increased. The data are made available as a compressed archive with the article.

While the existence of device-independent protocols for tasks such as randomness expansion and quantum key distribution has recently been established, the underlying proofs of security remain very challenging, yield rather poor key rates, and demand very high quality quantum devices, thus making them all but impossible to implement in practice. We introduce a technique for the analysis of device-independent cryptographic protocols. We provide a flexible protocol and give a security proof that provides quantitative bounds that are asymptotically tight, even in the presence of general quantum adversaries. At a high level our approach amounts to establishing a reduction to the scenario in which the untrusted device operates in an identical and independent way in each round of the protocol. This is achieved by leveraging the sequential nature of the protocol and makes use of a newly developed tool, the "entropy accumulation theorem" of Dupuis, Fawzi, and Renner [Entropy Accumulation, preprint, 2016]. As concrete applications we give simple and modular security proofs for device-independent quantum key distribution and randomness expansion protocols based on the CHSH inequality. For both tasks, we establish essentially optimal asymptotic key rates and noise tolerance. In view of recent experimental progress, which has culminated in loophole-free Bell tests, it is likely that these protocols can be practically implemented in the near future.

Such taphonomic variability complicates both the description of microbial elements preserved within geologic materials and the potential interpretation of microbial biomarkers. This study uses a taphonomic assessment to explore the preservation of different microbial components within silicified microbial mats of the late Mesoproterozoic (similar to 1.0 Ga) Angmaat Formation, Bylot Supergroup, Baffin Island. The Angmaat Formation consists of unmetamorphosed and essentially undeformed strata that represent intertidal to supratidal deposition within an evaporative microbial flat. Early diagenetic silicification preserved microbial communities across a range of environments, from those episodically exposed to persistently submerged. Here, we present the development of a new methodology involving the use of high-resolution image mosaics to investigate the taphonomy of microfossils preserved in these mats. A taphonomic grade is assigned using a modified classification that accounts for both the taphonomic preservation state (good, fair, poor) of individual microfossils, as well as the degree of compaction of the overall mat. We show that although various taphonomic states occur within each of the silicified mats, the overall taphonomic assessment differentiates between well-preserved mats that are interpreted to have been silicified during active growth, to highly degraded and compacted mats that are interpreted to represent preservation during later stages of biological decomposition. These data indicate that even small changes in the timing of silicification may have substantial implications on our identification of microbial biomarkers and, therefore, our interpretation of early Earth ecosystems.

Thermal, Deformation, and Degassing Remote Sensing Time Series (CE 2000-2017) at the 47 most Active Volcanoes in Latin America: Implications for Volcanic Systems	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article							SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO; MODERATE-MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKES; CENTRAL ANDES; SOUTHERN ANDES; VILLARRICA VOLCANO; COPAHUE VOLCANO; LASCAR VOLCANO; PACAYA VOLCANO; EXTRUSION RATE; CORDON CAULLE	Volcanoes are hazardous to local and global populations, but only a fraction are continuously monitored by ground-based sensors. For example, in Latin America, more than 60% of Holocene volcanoes are unmonitored, meaning long-term multiparameter data sets of volcanic activity are rare and sparse. We use satellite observations of degassing, thermal anomalies, and surface deformation spanning 17years at 47 of the most active volcanoes in Latin America and compare these data sets to ground-based observations archived by the Global Volcanism Program. This first comparison of multisatellite time series on a regional scale provides information regarding volcanic behavior during, noneruptive, pre-eruptive, syneruptive, and posteruptive periods. For example, at Copahue volcano, deviations from background activity in all three types of satellite measurements were manifested months to years in advance of renewed eruptive activity in 2012. By quantifying the amount of degassing, thermal output, and deformation measured at each of these volcanoes, we test the classification of these volcanoes as open or closed volcanic systems. We find that similar to 28% of the volcanoes do not fall into either classification, and the rest show elements of both, demonstrating a dynamic range of behavior that can change over time. Finally, we recommend how volcano monitoring could be improved through better coordination of available satellite-based capabilities and new instruments.

More often than not, however, impulsive signals are mere nuisance signals. One of the most fundamentaland difficulttasks in EEW is to rapidly and reliably discriminate real local earthquake signals from all other signals. This discrimination is necessarily based on very little information, typically a few seconds worth of seismic waveforms from a small number of stations. As a result, current EEW systems struggle to avoid discrimination errors and suffer from false and missed alerts. In this study we show how modern machine learning classifiers can strongly improve real-time signal/noise discrimination. We develop and compare a series of nonlinear classifiers with variable architecture depths, including fully connected, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and a model that combines a generative adversarial network with a random forest. We train all classifiers on the same data set, which includes 374k local earthquake records (M3.0-9.1) and 946k impulsive noise signals. We find that all classifiers outperform existing simple linear classifiers and that complex models trained directly on the raw signals yield the greatest degree of improvement. Using 3-s-long waveform snippets, the convolutional neural network and the generative adversarial network with a random forest classifiers both reach 99.5% precision and 99.3% recall on an independent validation data set. Most misclassifications stem from impulsive teleseismic records, and from incorrectly labeled records in the data set. Our results suggest that machine learning classifiers can strongly improve the reliability and speed of EEW alerts. Plain Language Summary Seismic stations record not only earthquake signals but also a wide variety of nuisance signals. Some of these nuisance signals are impulsive and can initially look very similar to real earthquake signals. This is a problem for earthquake early warning (EEW) algorithms, which sometimes misinterpret such signals as being real earthquake signals, and which may then send out false alerts. For each registered impulsive signal, EEW systems need to decide (or, classify) in real-time whether or not the signal stems from an actual earthquake. State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) classifiers have been shown to strongly outperform more standard linear classifiers in a wide range of classification problems. Here we analyze the performance of a variety of different ML classifiers to identify which type of classifier leads to the most reliable signal/noise discrimination in an EEW context. We find that we can successfully train complex deep learning classifiers that can discriminate between nuisance and earthquake signals very reliably (accuracy of 99.5%). Less complex ML classifiers also outperform a linear classifier, but with significantly higher error rates. The deep ML classifiers may allow EEW systems to almost entirely avoid false and missed signal detections.

PhaseLink: A Deep Learning Approach to Seismic Phase Association	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						phase association; deep learning; earthquake detection; earthquake monitoring	EARTHQUAKE; PICKING; NETWORK	Seismic phase association is a fundamental task in seismology that pertains to linking together phase detections on different sensors that originate from a common earthquake. It is widely employed to detect earthquakes on permanent and temporary seismic networks and underlies most seismicity catalogs produced around the world. This task can be challenging because the number of sources is unknown, events frequently overlap in time, or can occur simultaneously in different parts of a network. We present PhaseLink, a framework based on recent advances in deep learning for grid-free earthquake phase association. Our approach learns to link phases together that share a common origin and is trained entirely on millions of synthetic sequences of P and S wave arrival times generated using a 1-D velocity model. Our approach is simple to implement for any tectonic regime, suitable for real-time processing, and can naturally incorporate errors in arrival time picks. Rather than tuning a set of ad hoc hyperparameters to improve performance, PhaseLink can be improved by simply adding examples of problematic cases to the training data set. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PhaseLink on a challenging sequence from southern California and synthesized sequences from Japan designed to test the point at which the method fails. For the examined data sets, PhaseLink can precisely associate phases to events that occur only approximate to 12s apart in origin time. This approach is expected to improve the resolution of seismicity catalogs, add stability to real-time seismic monitoring, and streamline automated processing of large seismic data sets.

In animals it has been shown to enable a stimulus to indicate the current value of a reinforcer. However, the exact nature of the current value representations in humans remains unknown. Specifically, do neurons of the human amygdala represent current value signals only in tasks requiring valuation? We recorded from 406 neurons in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus of 6 neurosurgical patients while subjects repeatedly viewed 40 different pictures of sweet or salty "junk food" items in 2 different tasks. Neural activity during stimulus inspection in a valuation task reflected food preferences in the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. Notably, only left amygdala activity represented these food preferences even in a sweet-salty classification task. Valuation signals of the left amygdala thus appear to be stimulus-, not-task driven.

Twinning may degrade crystal quality and affect nonlinear optical properties, in particular if crystals are composed of twin domains with opposing polarities. Here, we use measurements of optical activity to demonstrate the existence of inversion twins within single crystals of (KABO). We determine the optical rotatory dispersion of YAB and KABO throughout the visible spectrum using a spectrophotometer with rotatable polarizers. Space-resolved measurements of the optical rotation can be related to the twin structure and give estimates on the extent of twinning. The reported dispersion relations for the rotatory power of YAB and KABO may be used to assess crystal quality and to select twin-free specimens.

Surface Roughness and Gravitational Slope Distributions of Vesta and Ceres	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						asteroid; surface; roughness; impact cratering; impact ejecta	TOPOGRAPHIC ROUGHNESS; GRAVITY-FIELD; INTERIOR STRUCTURE; GEOLOGIC FEATURES; ROTATION PERIOD; SPIN POLE; 433 EROS; MERCURY; SHAPE; MARS	Heavily cratered terrains dominate the surfaces of asteroid 4 Vesta and dwarf planet 1 Ceres. The data from the Dawn spacecraft allowed reconstruction of high-resolution shape models of these bodies. We used the stereophotoclinometric shape models to compute gravitational slopes and topographic roughness of Vesta and Ceres. We compute the slope distributions of Vesta and Ceres and compare them to those of the other bodies with heavily cratered terrains. The distribution of slopes of Vesta and Ceres has a kink at approximate to 34 degrees. The slope distribution is steeper for slopes higher than approximate to 34 degrees. The Moon and Mars have a similar kink but at a lower (shallower) slope (approximate to 29 degrees-30 degrees). We hypothesize that this kink corresponds to the angle of repose, which is higher on the two minor bodies compared to that of Mars and the Moon. We have also analyzed the topographic roughness of Vesta and Ceres. Vesta's topography is characterized by lower roughness in the southern hemisphere that was resurfaced by giant impacts. The roughness of Ceres is mostly controlled by regional-scale geology with no significant large-scale variations. Large, fresh craters have smooth ejecta blankets on both Vesta and Ceres unlike previously observed rough ejecta on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury. On Ceres, the smooth ejecta craters also have smooth floors explained by impact slurry. Lineaments of elevated roughness are abundant on Ceres, whereas are nearly absent on Vesta. The roughness maps we produced provide a synoptic view of the surface texture and could be used to aid geologic mapping. Plain Language Summary We have computed and analyzed surface slopes of Vesta and Ceres. We find a deficiency of slopes steeper than a certain critical angle. We hypothesize that this angle is the angle of repose. Angle of repose is the natural maximum angle at which a pile of granular material can stay at rest. In addition, we find that this critical angle is approximately 4 degrees-5 degrees higher on Ceres and Vesta compared to Moon and Mars. This reason of this difference is unknown. We have also looked at the surface of roughness of Vesta and Ceres. We found that large, fresh craters on Vesta and Ceres have smooth surroundings, unlike craters on the Moon, Mars, and Mercury that have rough surroundings. On Ceres, craters also have smooth floors explained by impact slurry. Rays of high roughness are often seen on Ceres, whereas are nearly absent on Vesta. The roughness maps we produced provide a global view of the surface texture and could be used to aid geologic mapping.	[Ermakov, Anton I.; Scully, Jennifer E.

Water Vapor Contribution to Ceres' Exosphere From Observed Surface Ice and Postulated Ice-Exposing Impacts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Ceres; water ice stability; impact craters; exosphere	SHALLOW SUBSURFACE; GROUND ICE; MODEL; PREDICTIONS; CONSTRAINTS; DEPOSITS; HISTORY; BELT	Telescopic observations have detected an exosphere around Ceres, composed of either water vapor or its photolytic products. Proposed mechanisms for its formation include sublimation or sputtering from solar energetic particles of buried ice, surface ice, or an optically thin seasonal polar cap. We estimate the amount of water vapor produced by known exposures of water ice, detected in Dawn spacecraft image and spectral data and by ice exposures from subresolution impact craters. We use thermal and sublimation modeling to take into account slope, orientation, and, in the case of water ice within craters, shadowing due to crater walls. We use a Monte Carlo approach to calculate the number of ice-exposing impacts, where they occur on Ceres' surface, and how long the ice within the impact crater remains bright (e.g., less than one monolayer of sublimation lag). We find that the observed water ice patches on Ceres could account for 0.06kg/s of water vapor to (with Oxo crater as the main contributor) and that ice-exposing impacts that remain bright in appearance after one Ceres year supply 0.08-0.56kg/s of vapor, depending on the regolith volume fraction of the ice. While water ice has not been detected to date at Occator crater, if it were present we find that Occator is unlikely to be a major contributor of vapor. We find a typical background water vapor production rate from all of Ceres, combining surface and buried ice, of about a few tenths of a kilogram per second. Plain Language Summary Ceres, the closest dwarf planet to the Sun, may be periodically surrounded with water vapor. This water vapor could be coming from water ice, either exposed at the surface or buried, undergoing temperature changes during Ceres' day and year. Vapor could also be released from ice that is bombarded by solar energetic particles. In this paper, we calculate how much water vapor could be produced from ice currently exposed on the surface of Ceres due to changes in temperature. We calculate the water vapor produced from observed surface water ice patches identified in Dawn spacecraft mission data. We also calculate water vapor produced from likely water ice patches that are exposed to space after a new impact crater forms but are too small to be seen by the Dawn spacecraft's instruments. We find that from these sources plus water vapor produced from buried water ice tables (calculated in other papers), about a few tenths of a kilogram per second of water vapor is likely to be escaping Ceres at the present day.

Abiotic Input of Fixed Nitrogen by Bolide Impacts to Gale Crater During the Hesperian: Insights From the Mars Science Laboratory	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						Mars; nitrogen fixation; nitrates; bolide impacts; Gale crater; Curiosity	ROCKNEST AEOLIAN DEPOSIT; NITRIC-OXIDE; NOX PRODUCTION; EARLY EARTH; EVOLUTION; ATMOSPHERE; FIXATION; HYDROGEN; SEDIMENTARY; VOLCANISM	Molecular hydrogen (H-2) from volcanic emissions is suggested to warm the Martian surface when carbon dioxide (CO2) levels dropped from the Noachian (4100 to 3700 Myr) to the Hesperian (3700 to 3000 Myr). Its presence is expected to shift the conversion of molecular nitrogen (N-2) into different forms of fixed nitrogen (N). Here we present experimental data and theoretical calculations that investigate the efficiency of nitrogen fixation by bolide impacts in CO2-N-2 atmospheres with or without H-2. Surprisingly, nitric oxide (NO) was produced more efficiently in 20% H-2 in spite of being a reducing agent and not likely to increase the rate of nitrogen oxidation. Nevertheless, its presence led to a faster cooling of the shock wave raising the freeze-out temperature of NO resulting in an enhanced yield. We estimate that the nitrogen fixation rate by bolide impacts varied from 7x10(-4) to 2x10(-3)gNMyr(-1)cm(-2) and could imply fluvial concentration to explain the nitrogen (1.40.7gNMyr(-1)cm(-2)) detected as nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) by Curiosity at Yellowknife Bay. One possible explanation is that the nitrogen detected in the lacustrine sediments at Gale was deposited entirely on the crater's surface and was subsequently dissolved and transported by superficial and ground waters to the lake during favorable wet climatic conditions. The nitrogen content sharply decreases in younger sediments of the Murray formation suggesting a decline of H-2 in the atmosphere and the rise of oxidizing conditions causing a shortage in the supply to putative microbial life. Plain Language Summary Climate models are able to warm early Mars when CO2 sources were strong but fail at later times when liquid water still flowed on the surface. A possible solution for the climate puzzle is the presence of abundant H-2 arising from volcanic emissions that could have kept the planet from freezing. H-2 could have also played a key role in the chemistry of the atmosphere. Curiosity discovered the presence of nitrites and nitrates, forms of fixed nitrogen that are required for the origin and sustainability of life in sediments in Gale crater. Here we present theoretical and experimental data that quantify the conversion of molecular nitrogen into fixed nitrogen in the presence and absence of H-2 by the entry shocks of asteroids in the Martian atmosphere and surface. Fixed nitrogen was originally deposited on the surface of Gale crater and then transported to the lake during favorable wet climatic conditions. We found that H-2 is required to yield sufficient fixed nitrogen to explain its detection. The levels of fixed nitrogen sharply dropped in younger sediments suggesting a decline of H-2 in the atmosphere and the rise of oxidizing conditions causing a nitrogen crisis to putative microbial communities.

Alan			Geologic Landforms and Chronostratigraphic History of Charon as Revealed by a Hemispheric Geologic Map	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS			English	Article						New Horizons; Charon; geologic map; tectonics; ice; comparative planetology	PLUTO; IMAGER; ICE	Geologic mapping has been used for over 200years as a technique to synthesize a complicated surface into a more simplified product, identifying similar types of surface features, and placing them into a relative stratigraphy. Geomorphologic mapping has applied those principles to other terrestrial bodies throughout the solar system and has formed an important product set to understand these surfaces, plan future exploration, and conduct different scientific endeavors. We created a geomorphologic map of the New Horizons encounter hemisphere of Pluto's binary companion, Charon. Ten primary geomorphologic unit categories were identified, covering approximately 35% of Charon's surface, and we used lower resolution data to speculate about other regions of Charon. Over 1,000 linear features were mapped, nearly 90% of them are tectonic in nature, and we use these to provide evidence of Charon being active in its past. Additionally, we placed the mapped features into a chronostratigraphic sequence, and we present a possible surface history for the body. The northern terrain typified by large crustal blocks is the oldest, having fractured early in Charon's history, and potentially similar blocks were submerged in a cryoflow of which the now solid surface of Vulcan Planitia is the remnant today. Plain Language Summary Planetary scientists will create geologic maps of a surface to perform different kinds of studies. Geologic maps identify features of different types and help to distill many different kinds of data into an easier to use format from which scientific investigations can be done. We have created such a map for Pluto's largest companion, Charon, imaged during the flyby of New Horizons in July 2015. This geologic map covers approximately 35% of the best-imaged region of Charon, and we mapped 16 different geologic units, over 1,000 linear features, and a variety of albedo features. We developed a chronology that places these features in time-order, and we provide potential interpretations of the different features that we mapped. We found that Charon has potentially one of the most convincing examples of possible large cryoflow(s) of any heretofore imaged body in the solar system.

Initially, high-dimensional data are projected into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclical monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semiparametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. Our procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-the pairwise distances between data points are preserved through random projections. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner data set.

Downscaling Vertical GPS Observations to Derive Watershed-Scale Hydrologic Loading in the Northern Rockies	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL REFERENCE FRAME; STORAGE; PRECIPITATION; DETECTABILITY; DEFORMATION; PREDICTION; COMPONENT; PATTERNS; UPLIFT; EARTH	GPS time series of vertical displacement include the elastic response of the Earth to a combination of regional and local loading signals arising from hydrologic mass transfer. The regional loading, controlled by seasonal, synoptic precipitation patterns, dominates the displacement of individual stations and is highly correlated among stations with separation distances from 10 to 300km. The local loading, controlled by small-scale precipitation and storage variability, has much shorter correlation lengths of <30km. We develop a new method to separate the regional and local contributions using common mode analysis and show that GPS is capable of measuring the local hydrologic load changes at watershed scales of tens of kilometers. Using this methodology, GPS-measured displacement provides an integrated measurement of hydrologic load at a spatial scale between the existing long-wavelength resolution of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and point measurement resolution of a precipitation station. Thus, GPS time series record critical observations for monitoring integrated hydrologic budgets at scales useful for water management and assessment of the hydro-ecological response to climate change. Plain Language Summary Even though estimating water quantity is critical for human communities, there are few good methods for doing so, especially in areas with lots of topography. Snow measurements and weather stations are only point observations that do not always represent the surrounding area, and satellite observations do not resolve small mountain watersheds well. We leverage the fact that the surface of the Earth is displaced by the weight of water, and that this deflection can be measured with GPS, to more accurately estimate water loading and unloading. We do this in snowpack-dominated areas of the northern Rockies and show that these methods complement the available tools.	[Knappe, E.; Bendick, R.; Martens, H. R.; Gardner, W.

Nanoporous Gold as a Highly Selective and Active Carbon Dioxide Reduction Catalyst	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						CO2 reduction; nanoporous cathode; pH gradient; grain boundaries; electrocatalysis	ELECTROCHEMICAL CO2 REDUCTION; COPPER; ELECTROREDUCTION; CONVERSION; SIZE	Electrochemical conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals is a promising approach for transforming CO2 into sustainably produced fuels and/or chemical feedstocks for industrial synthesis. We report that nanoporous gold (np-Au) films, with pore sizes ranging from 10 to 30 nm, represent promising electrocatalytic architectures for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their large electrochemically active surface area, relative abundance of grain boundaries, and ability to support pH gradients inside the nanoporous network. Electrochemical studies show that np-Au films support partial current densities for the conversion of CO2 to CO in excess of 6 mA cm(-2) at a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 99% in aqueous electrolytes (50 mM K2CO3 saturated with CO2). Moreover, np-Au films are able to maintain Faradaic efficiency greater than 80% for CO2 production over prolonged periods of continuous operation (110 h). Electrocatalytic experiments at different electrolyte concentrations demonstrate that the pore diameter of nanoporous cathodes represents a critical parameter for creating and controlling local pH gradients inside the porous network of metal ligaments. These results demonstrate the merits of nanoporous metal films for the CO2RR and offer an interesting architecture for highly selective electrocatalysis capable of sustaining high catalytic currents over prolonged periods.

Expedition 361 Scientists	A New Seismic Stratigraphy in the Indian-Atlantic Ocean Gateway Resembles Major Paleo-Oceanographic Changes of the Last 7 Ma	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Agulhas Plateau; seismic reflection method; contourites; physical properties	DEEP-WATER CIRCULATION; AGULHAS PLATEAU; MARINE SEDIMENT; LATE MIOCENE; OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; BULK-DENSITY; SEA-LEVEL; PLIOCENE; IMPACTS; CLIMATE	The exchange of water masses between the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic constitutes an integral interocean link in the global thermohaline circulation. Long-term changes in deep water flow have been studied using seismic reflection profiles but the seismic stratigraphy was poorly constrained and not resolved for the time period from the late Miocene onward. Here we present results from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1475 (Agulhas Plateau) located over a sediment drift proximal to the entrance of North Atlantic Deep Water into the Southern Ocean and South Indian Ocean. Site U1475 comprises a complete carbonate-rich stratigraphic section of the last similar to 7 Ma that provides an archive of climate-induced variations in ocean circulation. Six marker reflectors occurring in the upper 300 m of the drift are identified here for the first time. The formation of these reflectors is mainly due to density changes that are mostly caused by changes in biogenic versus terrigenous sediment deposition. Synthetic seismograms allow age assignments for the horizons based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Prominent reflectors are related to late Pleistocene glacial/interglacial variability, the middle and early Pleistocene transitions, and the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciation. A peculiar early Pliocene interval (similar to 5.3-4.0 Ma) bounded by two reflectors is characterized by fourfold elevated sedimentation rates (> 10 cm/kyr) and the occurrence of sediment waves. We argue that this enhanced sediment transport to the Agulhas Plateau was caused by a reorganization of the bottom current circulation pattern due to maximized inflow of North Atlantic Deep Water.

Robust Digital Filter Structures: A Direct Approach	IEEE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							STABLE MULTIDIMENSIONAL POLYNOMIALS; PARASITIC-OSCILLATIONS; LATTICE STRUCTURES; TRANSFER-MATRICES; STABILITY-TEST; DESIGN; SENSITIVITY; REALIZATION; BANKS; IMPLEMENTATION	One of the many contributions of Prof. Fettweis was the invention of wave digital filters. These filters are obtained from classical RLC filters, in particular doubly terminated lossless two-ports, by using some transformations. Namely, the voltages and currents in the circuit elements are transformed into wave-variables and then a bilinear transformation is performed. If the wave transformation is performed appropriately it results in a realizable digital filter structure which furthermore enjoys a number of robustness properties such as low passband sensitivity, low roundoff noise, and freedom from limit cycle oscillations. Prof. Fettweis and his colleagues also showed that these properties are due to the inheritence of passivity properties from the continuous-time domain into the digital filter domain. Subsequent to this landmark work, a number of researchers worked on the problem of obtaining robust digital filter structures without starting from continuoustime circuits. One of these is the structurally bounded or structurally passive class of digital filters. These structures are based on inducing structural passivity directly into the implementation and are therefore simpler, both conceptually and from a practical viewpoint. They are also more general and lead to new structures which have no natural connection to electrical circuits. This paper gives an overview of some of these developments.	[Vaidyanathan, P.

Symmetry Incorporated Cost-Effective Architectures for Two-Dimensional Digital Filters	IEEE CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							DESIGN; REALIZATION	Professor Fettweis as far back as 1977 published a paper generalizing McClellan transformation to obtain circular symmetry in 2-D and spherical, hyper-spherical symmetries in multidimensional digital filters [1]. This survey paper presents state-of-the-art two-dimensional (2-D) VLSI digital filter architectures possessing various symmetries in the filter magnitude response. Preceding the symmetry structures, a generalized formulation is given that allows the derivation of various new 2-D VLSI filter structures of any order without global broadcast. Following this, two types (namely, Type 1 [20] and Type 3 [21], [25], [26]) of cost-effective 2-D magnitude symmetry filter architectures possessing diagonal, four-fold rotational, quadrantal, and octagonal symmetries with reduced number of multipliers are given. By combining the identities of the Types-1 and 3 symmetry filter structures, multimode 2-D symmetry filters which enable the above four symmetry modes are discussed. The Type-1 and Type-3 multimode filters can result in a 65.3% cost reduction in terms of number of multipliers compared with the sum of the multipliers of the four individual Type-1 symmetry filter structures studied in this paper. Furthermore, Type-3 has shorter critical path than Type-1 multimode filter. The paper is concluded with the presentation of a 2-D filter design example and a corresponding structure.

Spin-Up of the Southern Hemisphere Super Gyre	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							EQUATORIAL CURRENT BIFURCATION; SST DIPOLE EVENTS; INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; SEA-LEVEL; OCEAN CIRCULATION; AGULHAS LEAKAGE; EXPENDABLE BATHYTHERMOGRAPH; SUBTROPICAL GYRE; TASMAN LEAKAGE	This study investigates the variability of the Southern Hemisphere super gyre (SHSG), using remotely sensed altimeter measurements, in situ Argo observations, and results from an ocean state estimate of the Consortium for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean. Analyses of altimeter data show large trends of sea surface height, and their positive-negative contrast suggests a strengthening of subtropical gyres in all the three Southern Hemisphere oceans since 1993. Analyses of Argo data and the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean estimate indicate that these dynamic signals of southern subtropical gyres extend to at least 2,000m. The three southern subtropical gyres are interconnected through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages and vary consistently during the period 1993-2016. The Tasman and Agulhas leakages also show an increasing trend of inter-ocean water exchange with a typical increase of similar to 2 Sv (1 Sv=10(6)m(3)/s) per decade, indicative of a two-decade-long spin-up of the SHSG. The strengthening and poleward shift of westerly winds are associated with an increasing southern annular mode, which affect the midlatitude and high-latitude Southern Hemisphere oceans and contribute to the spin-up of the SHSG. Plain Language Summary The Southern Hemisphere super gyre (SHSG) is an interconnected circulation system of the southern subtropical gyres. It sweeps out of the Tasman Sea, transports water westward, and feeds the upper limb of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages. The SHSG absorbs substantial quantities of atmospheric gases, such as oxygen and CO2, thus directly contributing to climate change. In this study, we analyze remotely sensed altimeter measurements, in situ observations, and outputs of an ocean general circulation model. The results reveal a two-decade-long spin-up of the SHSG. The inter-ocean exchange through the Tasman and Agulhas leakages shows an increasing trend during the period 1993-2016. This long-term trend may be attributed to changes in westerly winds associated with an increasing southern annular mode.

Southern Ocean Biogeochemical Float Deployment Strategy, With Example From the Greenwich Meridian Line (GO-SHIP A12)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS			English	Article							TOTAL GEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION; ANTARCTIC INTERMEDIATE WATER; GLOBAL OCEAN; SEA-ICE; PROFILING FLOATS; OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; MAUD-RISE; HEAT; CARBON	Biogeochemical Argo floats, profiling to 2,000-m depth, are being deployed throughout the Southern Ocean by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling program (SOCCOM). The goal is 200 floats by 2020, to provide the first full set of annual cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, and optical properties across multiple oceanographic regimes. Building from no prior coverage to a sparse array, deployments are based on prior knowledge of water mass properties, mean frontal locations, mean circulation and eddy variability, winds, air-sea heat/freshwater/carbon exchange, prior Argo trajectories, and float simulations in the Southern Ocean State Estimate and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Twelve floats deployed from the 2014-2015 Polarstern cruise from South Africa to Antarctica are used as a test case to evaluate the deployment strategy adopted for SOCCOM's 20 deployment cruises and 126 floats to date. After several years, these floats continue to represent the deployment zones targeted in advance: (1) Weddell Gyre sea ice zone, observing the Antarctic Slope Front, and a decadally-rare polynya over Maud Rise; (2) Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) including the topographically steered Southern Zone chimney where upwelling carbon/nutrient-rich deep waters produce surprisingly large carbon dioxide outgassing; (3) Subantarctic and Subtropical zones between the ACC and Africa; and (4) Cape Basin. Argo floats and eddy-resolving HYCOM simulations were the best predictors of individual SOCCOM float pathways, with uncertainty after 2years of order 1,000km in the sea ice zone and more than double that in and north of the ACC. Plain Language Summary The Southern Ocean, which surrounds Antarctica, is a huge, very sparsely observed region. But we know from the decades of observations and from computer models that the Southern Ocean is a major player in the Earth's climate, taking up a significant fraction of the excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and absorbing a large fraction of the extra heat that results from that extra carbon dioxide. The extra carbon dioxide is also acidifying the Southern Ocean waters. To observe these, we are expanding one of the major ocean-observing systems: Argo profiling floats that measure temperature and salinity to 2,000-m depth every 10days. SOCCOM has (1) added extra sensors that measure the ocean's pH, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll, and particles; (2) developed algorithms to derive the rest of the carbon budget terms, and (3) vigorously expanded Argo into the enormous seasonal ice zone. We are deploying about 30 floats per year all around Antarctica. We describe our strategy for float deployments in 2014 in the large region between Africa and Antarctica, describing the circulation, water properties, and forcing of this region. We evaluate how well we met our goal of sampling each of the distinct oceanographic regimes.	[Talley, L. D.; Rosso, I.; Mazloff, M.

J	Sauer, K; Baumgartel, K; Sydora, R; Winterhalter, D				Sauer, Konrad; Baumgaertel, Klaus; Sydora, Richard; Winterhalter, Daniel			Parametric Decay of Ream-Generated Langmuir Waves and Three-wave Interaction in Plateau Plasmas: Implicatoins for Type III Radiation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article							FINE-STRUCTURE; FREQUENCY; BURSTS; OSCILLATIONS; INSTABILITY; RELEVANCE; COLLAPSE	Inspired by the results of particle-in-cell simulations on beam-plasma interaction, we present a mechanism for the generation of radio waves in solar type III bursts which provides a closed chain of the conversion processes from beam-generated Langmuir waves into electromagnetic emission. The mechanism is characterized by two key steps. The first is a hitherto unknown parametric decay process in which the primary wave directly decays to low-k Langmuir waves (plasma oscillations) and ion acoustic waves. This decay becomes possible due to changes in the dispersion properties of longitudinal waves initiated by the presence of a beam or a plateau in the electron velocity distribution. A resonant three-wave interaction is established between the beam-induced Langmuir wave, the plasma oscillations, and the ion acoustic wave. Due to weak damping of the waves involved, this interaction persists after the beam has relaxed to a plateau and lasts as long as the latter exists. In the second step, low-k Langmuir waves in the range of "optical wavelengths" can linearly couple to obliquely propagating radio waves at the plasma frequency in a wave number region around the cross points where quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse modes approach each other. Our model does not need the persistence of the beam and the associated instability for radiation to be produced. Although the theory is local with respect to the plasma frequency, it may open a way to overcome Sturrock's (1964) dilemma of rapid beam relaxation on the one side and long-lived radiation on the other. The observed frequency variation is suggested to arise by "adiabatic" motion of the beam-created interaction region through the heliospheric plasma of decreasing electron density. Implications for the interpretation of in situ Langmuir waveforms and the diversity of their frequency spectra are discussed. Plain Language Summary The problem treated in our work belongs to one of the most investigated subjects of plasma physics, the interaction of a fast electron beam with a plasma. We focus on the generation of radio waves in this interaction and provide a closed chain of conversion processes from beam-generated Langmuir waves into electromagnetic emission. Key step is a hitherto unknown parametric decay process in which the primary wave directly decays into Langmuir waves of nearly zero wave number (Langmuir oscillations) and ion acoustic waves. This decay process becomes possible due to changes in the dispersion properties of the beam-plasma system induced by the beam itself and its subsequent relaxation to a plateau. The presence of Langmuir waves of "optical" wavelengths is the presupposition for mode coupling to radio waves. Our conclusions are based on 1-D particle simulations, solutions of the Zakharov equations, and analytical efforts. There are implications for the interpretation of so-called solar type III radio bursts. Sturrock (1964) pointed in this context to the discrepancy of rapid beam relaxation on the one side and long-lived radiation on the other. Our results may provide a way to overcome this dilemma.

This discrepancy was observed in the longest-wavelength filter of the camera (the longpass R7 filter with system lambda(eff) = 1,009 nm) and consisted of a reduction in contrast between bright and dark regions. Here we describe and characterize this effect. We propose that the effect arises because long-wavelength photons close to the silicon band-gap at 1,100 nm are allowed through the R7 filter, pass through the bulk charge-coupled device, scatter from the backside, pass through the charge-coupled device again, and are registered in a pixel other than the pixel through which they originally entered. Based on this hypothesis we develop a model capable of accurately simulating the effect, and correct for it. We present preliminary results from testing this correction on preflight, as well as in-flight, images. The effect is small, but in some specific cases in small regions of high contrast, the effect is significant. In in-flight images of Martian terrain we observed the signal in dark shadows to be artificially inflated by up to similar to 33% and analysis of early-mission calibration target images indicated that the reduced contrast due to the artifact is equivalent to > 100 DN (full well = 4095 DN) for a hypothetical perfectly dark pixel.

Study of Terrestrial Glints Based on DSCOVR Observations	EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE			English	Article							ORIENTED ICE CRYSTALS; SCATTERING; PARTICLES; EARTH	Small flashes of reflected light-called glints-are found in images taken by spacecraft observing the Earth, and occur due to specularly reflected solar radiation. These glints have been found over both ocean and land. Using Deep Space Climate Observatory observations, we show that glints over land are due to specular reflection off horizontally oriented ice platelets floating in the air, while glints over ocean have contributions from reflection off either platelets floating above the ocean or a relatively smooth ocean surface. We use a radiative transfer model to simulate different kinds of glints and to explore their properties. This technique of comparing observations of terrestrial glints with model simulations may provide new information relevant to atmospheric dynamics and the search for habitable exoplanets.

The result is an earthquake potential score that characterizes the current state of progress of a defined geographic region through its nominal earthquake "cycle." The count of small earthquakes since the last large earthquake is the natural time that has elapsed since the last large earthquake (Varotsos et al., 2006, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.021123). In addition to natural time, earthquake sequences can also be analyzed using Shannon information entropy ("information"), an idea that was pioneered by Shannon (1948, https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x). As a first step to add seismic information entropy into the nowcasting method, we incorporate magnitude information into the natural time counts by using event self-information. We find in this first application of seismic information entropy that the earthquake potential score values are similar to the values using only natural time. However, other characteristics of earthquake sequences, including the interevent time intervals, or the departure of higher magnitude events from the magnitude-frequency scaling line, may contain additional information.

We first train Markov models to describe the lane-change environment for an automated vehicle under assumed traffic patterns. Parameters in the environment model are trained using traffic data and calibrated using control improvisation. Then, based on human lane-change behavior, we train a voluntary lane-change policy using explicit-duration Markov decision process. Parameters in the lane-change policy are calibrated through control improvisation to allow an automated car to voluntarily change lanes while avoiding overly frequent lane-change maneuvers under various traffic environments.

In these contexts, reconciliation is often performed using maximum parsimony under the Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) event model. In general, the number of maximum parsimony reconciliations (MPRs) can grow exponentially with the size of the trees. While a number of previous efforts have been made to count the number of MPRs, find representative MPRs, and compute the frequencies of events across the space of MPRs, little is known about the structure of MPR space. In particular, how different are MPRs in terms of the events that they comprise? One way to address this question is to compute the diameter of MPR space, defined to be the maximum number of DTL events that distinguish any two MPRs in the solution space. We show how to compute the diameter of MPR space in polynomial time and then apply this algorithm to a large biological dataset to study the variability of events.

The common origin and alteration history of the hypabyssal and volcanic phases of the Wadi Tarr albitite complex, southern Sinai, Egypt	LITHOS			English	Article						Albitite; Fenitization; Sodic amphibole; Cupola; Intrusive carbonate; Sinai; Arabian-Nubian Shield	ARABIAN-NUBIAN SHIELD; KATHERINA RING COMPLEX; A-TYPE GRANITES; CALC-ALKALINE; CLINOPYROXENE COMPOSITION; SEDIMENTARY SUCCESSIONS; EASTERN DESERT; CORE COMPLEX; EVOLUTION; PENINSULA	New data and interpretations are presented for the igneous albitites of the Wadi Tarr area, southern Sinai, Egypt The albitite masses are isolated in outcrop from any granitic intrusions and have intrusive contacts against the country rocks without any structural control. They have marginal zones of brecdas with jigsaw-fit angular clasts suggesting explosive, in-situ formation. The albitites are of two types: the western, medium-grained, hypabyssal albitite and the eastern, fine-grained porphyritic albitite. The field relations suggest emplacement at different levels in a magmatic cupola: the hypabyssal texture and steeply dipping slope of the upper contact of the western albitite imply deeper emplacement whereas the gently dipping contacts and porphyritic texture of the eastern albitite masses indicate that they define the probable location of the cupola apex. Both types of albitites consist of albite (92-97%) with minor amounts of quartz, K-feldspar and biotite. The accessory minerals include Fe-oxides, augite, sulphides, zircon, rutile, xenotime, titanite, allanite and monazite. The whole-rock compositions of the hypabyssal and porphyritic albitites are closely related, but the porphyritic type has lower abundances of Sr, Ba, Y, Nb, Th and Zr. We show that the hypabyssal and porphyritic albitites have a common petrogenetic origin, most likely as late-stage cumulates from a fractionating, strongly alkaline A-type magma, consistent with the compositions of the mafic minerals.The source magma was probably a tephritic liquid; we use MELTS models to show that only a sufficiently alkaline magma follows a differentiation path that both avoids quartz saturation and encounters the alkali feldspar solvus, reaching a residual liquid in equilibrium with highly sodic feldspar. Although the MELTS results show a chemically consistent means of forming igneous albitite, they are incomplete in that physical segregation mechanisms are still required to isolate the albite from mafic minerals and or a low-temperature aqueous alteration stage is needed to leach K from the feldspar. Alteration surrounding the Wadi Tarr albitites is extensive and dominated by alkali metasomatism similar to fenitization. Alteration in the marginal breccia zone of the albitite is dominated by precipitation of amphibole and carbonate in veins and in the breccia matrix, whereas the volcanic country rocks show replacement of feldspars by sericite, carbonate and epidote as well as vein carbonate. The altered volcanic country rocks show lower concentrations of Fe2O3, Sr, Cu, Pb, Ba and Ce, accompanied by higher concentrations of Na2O and MgO compared to unaltered equivalent samples.

This effort has been mostly restricted to the slow and painstaking manual digitalization of the calving front positions in thousands of satellite imagery products. Here, we have developed a machine learning toolkit to automatically detect glacier calving front margins in satellite imagery. The toolkit is based on semantic image segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a modified U-Net architecture to isolate the calving fronts from satellite images after having been trained with a dataset of images and their corresponding manually-determined calving fronts. As a case study we train our neural network on a varied set of Landsat images with lowered resolutions from Jakobshavn, Sverdrup, and Kangerlussuaq glaciers, Greenland and test the results on images from Helheim glacier, Greenland to evaluate the performance of the approach. The neural network is able to identify the calving front in new images with a mean deviation of 96.3 m from the true fronts, equivalent to 1.97 pixels on average, while the corresponding error for manually-determined fronts on the same resolution images is 92.5 m (1.89 pixels). We find that the trained neural network significantly outperforms common edge detection techniques, and can be used to continuously map out calving-ice fronts with a variety of data products.

The focal plane arrays (FPAs) Noiie Equivalent Temperature Difference (NE Delta T), Quantum Efficiency (eta), Dark Current Density (J(D)), and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) performance were measured at operating temperatures. High performance 640 x 512 array format MWIR High Operating Temperature (HOT) FPA has typical NE Delta T similar to 19 mK, J(D) similar to 6.2 x 10(-7) A/cm(2), and eta similar to 53% using 3-5 pm band pass filter at 115 K operating temperatures. Best performance 640 x 512 array format LWIR FPA has NE Delta T similar to 25 mK, J(D) similar to 2.5 x 10(-5) A/cm(2) and eta similar to 41% using 8-9.4 mu m band pass filter at 60 K operating temperatures. For MTF investigation, a novel direct one-to-one image approach of Line Spread Function (LSF) and Edge Spread Function (ESF) are patterned onto substrate-removed FPAs. The direct ISF and ESF image are produced by 1000 A degrees thick gold layer deposition. The direct image horizontal and vertical MTFs are compared with projected knife-edge ESF-derived MTFs and results indicate that direct image MTFs have higher values compared to projected knife-edge ESF-derived MTFs at a Nyquist frequency. However, direct image MIT requires no lens MTF correction. The only relevant requirement for the direct image MTF is for the deposited pattern and substrate to be extremely thinned in which the HOT-BIRD FPAs fulfilled for this investigation.

After achieving orbit at Saturn in 2004, Cassini collected science data throughout its four-year prime mission (2004-2008) and nine-year extended mission (2008-2017). The Cassini Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) is perhaps the spacecraft subsystem that must satisfy the most mission and science pointing requirements. The performance of the Cassini AACS design was superb from launch through end of mission. All key mission and science requirements were met with significant margins. Overviews of the Cassini attitude control system design and flight performance (in 1997-2017) are given in this paper. Processes taken by the attitude control operations team to guard against human errors are also outlined. Cassini flight experience and many lessons learned are equally applicable to the safe operations of other interplanetary missions.

The purpose of the project was to develop and mature aerodynamic decelerator technologies for landing large mass payloads on the surface of Mars. The technologies included an attached toroidal Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, a ballute, and supersonic parachutes. Two flight tests were conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility. Sufficient data were acquired to reconstruct the vehicle trajectory, main motor thrust, atmosphere, and aerodynamics for these two flight tests. This paper describes the instrumentation, analysis techniques, acquired data, and reconstruction results from these two flight tests. A technique for processing gimballed inertial measurement unit data is developed in which the inertial flight path of the instrument is reconstructed, which is then mapped back to the vehicle body frame as a postprocessing step.

Heterogeneous retreat and ice melt of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							AMUNDSEN SEA EMBAYMENT; GROUNDING LINE RETREAT; KOHLER GLACIERS; PINE ISLAND; SHELVES; SMITH	The glaciers flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, have undergone acceleration and grounding line retreat over the past few decades that may yield an irreversible mass loss. Using a constellation of satellites, we detect the evolution of ice velocity, ice thinning, and grounding line retreat of Thwaites Glacier from 1992 to 2017. The results reveal a complex pattern of retreat and icemelt, with sectors retreating at 0.8 km/year and floating icemelting at 200m/year, while others retreat at 0.3 km/year with icemelting 10 times slower. We interpret the results in terms of buoyancy/slope-driven seawater intrusion along preferential channels at tidal frequencies leading to more efficient melt in newly formed cavities. Such complexities in ice-ocean interaction are not currently represented in coupled ice sheet/ocean models.

In Ref. [1], we generalized the notion of gapped phase to one of foliated fracton phase by allowing the addition of layers of gapped two-dimensional resources in the adiabatic evolution between gapped three-dimensional models. Moreover, we showed that the X-cube model is a fixed point of one such phase. In this paper, according to this definition, we look for universal properties of such phases which remain invariant throughout the entire phase. We propose multipartite entanglement quantities, generalizing the proposal of topological entanglement entropy designed for conventional topological phases. We present arguments for the universality of these quantities and show that they attain non-zero constant value in non-trivial foliated fracton phases.

Swimming to Stability: Structural and Dynamical Control via Active Doping	ACS NANO			English	Article						dynamic assembly; active matter; colloidal gel; depletion; Brownian dynamics	COLLOIDAL GELS; ASSEMBLING NANOPARTICLES; PHASE-SEPARATION; SIMULATIONS; PARTICLES; KINETICS; RHEOLOGY; VALENCE	External fields can decidedly alter the free energy landscape of soft materials and can be exploited as a powerful tool for the assembly of targeted nanostructures and colloidal materials. Here, we use computer simulations to demonstrate that nonequilibrium internal fields or forces-forces that are generated by driven components within a system-in the form of active particles can precisely modulate the dynamical free energy landscape of a model soft material, a colloidal gel. Embedding a small fraction of active particles within a gel can provide a unique pathway for the dynamically frustrated network to circumvent the kinetic barriers associated with reaching a lower free energy state through thermal fluctuations alone. Moreover, by carefully tuning the active particle properties (the propulsive swim force and persistence length) in comparison to those of the gel, the active particles may induce depletion-like forces between the constituent particles of the gel despite there being no geometric size asymmetry between the particles. These resulting forces can rapidly push the system toward disparate regions of phase space. Intriguingly, the state of the material can be altered by tuning macroscopic transport properties such as the solvent viscosity. Our findings highlight the potential wide-ranging structural and kinetic control facilitated by varying the dynamical properties of a remarkably small fraction of driven particles embedded in a host material.

Digital Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification on a Commercial Membrane	ACS SENSORS			English	Article						digital LAMP; membrane; microfluidic; droplets; nucleic acid; paper-based analytical device; PCR	POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION; ABSOLUTE QUANTIFICATION; RAPID DETECTION; ARRAY; CHIP; PCR; DROPLETS; FLOW; LAMP; GENERATION	In this work, we report digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) or reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) on a commercial membrane, without the need for complex chip fabrication or use of specialized equipment. Due to the pore size distribution, the theoretical error for digital LAMP on these membranes was analyzed, using a combination of Random Distribution Model and Multivolume Theory. A facile peel-off process was developed for effective droplet formation on the commercial track-etched polycarbonate (PCTE) membrane. Each pore functions as an individual nanoreactor for single DNA amplification. Absolute quantification of bacteria genomic DNA was realized with a dynamic range from 11 to 1.1 X 10(5) copies/mu L. One-step digital RT-LAMP was also successfully performed on the membrane for the quantification of MS2 virus in wastewater. With the introduction of new probes, the positive pores can be easily distinguished from negative ones with 100 times difference in fluorescence intensities. Finally, the cost of a disposable membrane is less than $0.10/piece, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most inexpensive way to perform digital LAMP. The membrane system offers opportunities for point-of-care users or common laboratories to perform digital quantification, single cell analysis, or other bioassays in an inexpensive, flexible, and simplified way.

Dynamics in the Phobos environment	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Phobos; Small body exploration; Astrodynamics; Surface motion	PERIODIC-ORBITS; STABILITY; BEHAVIOR	The dynamical environment on and about the Martian moon Phobos is explored. This planetary moon provides a unique dynamical environment in the solar system, being subject to extreme tidal forces and having a characteristically non-spherical shape. Further, it is not in a fully circular orbit, meaning that it has librations that arise from its eccentricity, contributing to a periodic forcing environment. Thus, to plan and implement missions in the vicinity of and on Phobos will require these considerations be taken into account. In this paper the latest published models of the Phobos shape and dynamics are used to characterize its dynamical environment in close proximity orbit about the body, for motion across its surface and for controlled hovering motion in its vicinity. It is found that surface motion is subject to a number of "speed limits" that can cause a moving vehicle to leave the surface and to possibly escape the moon and enter orbit about Mars. In terms of orbital stability, the existence of libration orbit families are characterized down to the surface using an exact potential, and the known stable QSO orbits are shown to be associated with families of stable quasi-periodic orbits.

Hydrogen oxidation kinetics on platinum-palladium bimetallic thin films for solid acid fuel cells	APL MATERIALS			English	Article							REDUCTION	Solid acid fuel cells (SAFCs) based on the proton-conductive electrolyte CsH2PO4 have shown promising power densities at an intermediate operating temperature of similar to 250 degrees C. However, Pt loadings in SAFCs remain higher than desirable, and the electrocatalysis mechanisms in these devices are still unknown. Here, hydrogen oxidation kinetics on Pt and Pt-Pd bimetallic thin film electrodes on CsH2PO4 have been evaluated to establish the potential for a beneficial role of Pd in SAFC anodes. Symmetric cells fabricated by depositing a metal film on both sides of electrolyte discs are characterized for studying hydrogen electro-oxidation across the gas vertical bar metal vertical bar CsH2PO4 structure. It was found that Pd reacts with CsH2PO4, forming palladium phosphide at the metalelectrolyte interface. Accordingly, the activity of Pd was examined in a bilayer geometry of Pd vertical bar Pt vertical bar CsH2PO4 vertical bar Pt vertical bar Pd. The bilayer Pt vertical bar Pd films showed much higher activity for hydrogen electro-oxidation than films of Pt alone, as measured by AC impedance spectroscopy. Ex situ low energy ion scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that Pd diffused into the Pt layer under operating conditions. The dramatic impact of Pd along with its presence throughout the film suggests that it catalyzes reactions at both the metal-gas and metal-electrolyte interfaces, as well as increasing hydrogen diffusion rates through the films.

Demby and Lamming use aesthetic modes of defamiliarization as a liberatory strategy, adopting modernist formal and temporal strategies to estrange structures of oppression. The essay argues for reading the authors' novels beyond national and canonical boundaries as part of a larger body of black Atlantic literature that deconstructs racialized regimes in the Global South. I conclude with a brief reading of each writer's intersections with Langston Hughes and Richard Wright, positing mobile networks of black diasporic affiliation forged in a period of global flux and transformation. This article compares two writers normally read only in distinct African American, Afro-Caribbean, and/or Black British contexts and calls attention to their shared priorities of black modernist innovation and politico-aesthetics.

Method of establishing breast cancer brain metastases affects brain uptake and efficacy of targeted, therapeutic nanoparticles	BIOENGINEERING & TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						blood-brain barrier; brain metastasis; breast cancer; nanoparticle; therapeutic delivery		HER2-targeted therapies effectively control systemic disease, but their efficacy against brain metastases is hindered by their low penetration of the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers (BBB and BTB). We investigate brain uptake and antitumor efficacy of transferrin receptor (TfR)-targeted, therapeutic nanoparticles designed to transcytose the BBB/BTB in three murine models. Two known models involving intracranial (IC) or intracardiac (ICD) injection of human breast cancer cells were employed, as was a third model developed here involving intravenous (IV) injection of the cells to form whole-body tumors that eventually metastasize to the brain. We show the method of establishing brain metastases significantly affects therapeutic BBB/BTB penetration. Free drug accumulates and delays growth in IC- and ICD-formed brain tumors, while non-targeted nanoparticles show uptake and inhibition only in IC-established metastases. TfR-targeted nanoparticles accumulate and significantly delay growth in all three models, suggesting the IV model maintains a more intact BBB/BTB than the other models.

Electrocatalysts exposed to approximate to 3-30 ALD cycles of TiO2 exhibited overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) of geometric current density that were several hundred millivolts lower than uncoated catalysts, with correspondingly higher specific activities. For example, the deposition of TiO2 onto IrO2 yielded a 9-fold increase in the OER-specific activity in 1.0 M H2SO4 (0.1 to 0.9 mA cm(ECSA)(-2) at 350 mV overpotential). The oxidation state of titanium and the potential of zero charge were also a function of the number of ALD cycles, indicating a correlation between oxidation state, potential of zero charge, and activity of the tuned electrocatalysts.

The method leverages the unique mission dose rate profile to bound device performance and reduces qualification test time from 1 year to 80 days. In addition, a new testing approach that simulates the mission dose profile revealed interesting information about the nature of radiation-induced defects in these "rad-hard" bipolar process lines. Results show that unlike bipolar parts from older generations (very sensitive to enhanced low dose rate sensitivity), these new processes seem to be dominated by oxide traps (N-ot) and not interface traps (N-it). This appears to be consistent with the mitigation used by vendors for reducing hydrogen (H-2) contamination in their processing steps.

The multiscale approach is divided into two modules. The first module generates information related to the bipolar junction transistor gain degradation that is a function of fabrication process, operational, and environmental inputs. The second uses this information as inputs for radiation-enabled circuit simulations. The prototype platform described in this paper estimates the total ionizing dose and dose rate responses of linear bipolar integrated circuits for different families of components. The simulation and experimental results show good correlation and suggest this platform to be a complementary tool within the radiation-hardness assurance flow. The platform may reduce some of the costly reliance on testing for all systems.	[Privat, A.; Barnaby, H. J.; Tolleson, B.

We postprocess raw SSI images to obtain frames with only the radiation contribution. The camera settings (gain state, filter, and so on) are used to compute the intensity of the observed radiation hits. Simulating the response of the SSI instrument to mono-energetic electron environments, we find that the SSI is capable of detecting >= 10-MeV electrons (> 90% of < 10-MeV particles are stopped with 95% confidence). Using geometric factors computed for the SSI, we calculate the environment particle flux given a number of pixels with radiation hits. We compare the SSI results to measurements from the Galileo EPD, examining the electron fluxes from the EPD >11-MeV integral flux channel. We find agreement within 3 sigma of the EPD data for 43 out of 43 (100%) of the SSI images evaluated. 62% of fluxes are also within 1 sigma of the EPD data. This approach can be applied to other sets of imaging data (star trackers) in energetic electron environments, such as those found in geostationary Earth orbit.

Undoped BaF2, however, has a slow scintillation component with 600 ns decay time, which causes pile-up. In the part I of this paper, we report investigations on La doping in BaF2 crystals to suppress the slow component. While typical fast/slow (F/S) ratio observed in undoped BaF2 is 1/5, La-doped BaF2 crystals were found to improve this ratio to about 1/1. The overall F/S ratio, however, is considered not sufficient for pile-up suppression.

Strong cerium-induced emissions peaked at 305 and 320 nm with a decay time of 25 ns were observed, in addition to the fast and slow scintillation at 220 and 300 nm, respectively. The La/Ce co-doping was also found effective in suppressing the slow component in BaF2. Compared to La-doped crystals, the La/Ce co-doped crystals have a better light output in both 50- and 2500-ns gate. The fast/slow ratio of La/Ce co-doped crystal was found to be about 1/1, similar to La-doping, which is also considered not sufficient for pile-up suppression. A 20-cm-long La/Ce co-doped BaF2 crystal shows also excellent optical quality and light response uniformity.

The primary oceanographic objective is to characterize the ocean eddies at a spatial resolution of 15 km for 68% of the ocean surface. This resolution is derived from the ratio between the wavenumber spectrum of the conventional altimeter (projected to submesoscale) and the SWOT SSH errors. While the 15-km threshold is useful as a global approximation of the spatial scales resolved by SWOT (SWOT scale), it can be misleading for regional studies. Here we revisit the problem using a high-resolution (similar to 2-km horizontal grid spacing) tide-resolving global ocean simulation and map the SWOT scale as a function of location and season. The results show that the SWOT scale increases, in general, from about 15 km at low latitudes to similar to 30-45 km at mid-and high latitudes but with a large geographical dependence. A SWOT scale smaller than 30 km is expected in the high-latitude energetic regions. The SWOT scale varies seasonally as a result of the seasonality in both the noise and ocean signals. The seasonality also has a geographical dependence. Both eddies and internal gravity waves/tides contribute significantly to the SWOT scale variation. Our analysis provides model predictions for interpreting the anticipated observations from SWOT and guidance for the development of analysis methodologies.

J	Basu, P				Basu, Pathikrit			Bayesian updating rules and AGM belief revision	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC THEORY			English	Article						Bayesian updating; AGM belief revision; Information processing; Lexicographic updating	EXPECTED UTILITY; CHOICE	We interpret the problem of updating beliefs as a choice problem (selecting a posterior from a set of admissible posteriors) with a reference point (prior). We use AGM belief revision to define the support of admissible posteriors after arrival of information, which applies also to zero probability events. We study two classes of updating rules for probabilities: 1) "lexicographic" updating rules where posteriors are given by a lexicographic probability system 2) "minimum distance" updating rules which select the posterior closest to the prior by some metric. We show that an updating rule is lexicographic if and only if it is Bayesian, AGM-consistent and satisfies a weak form of path independence. While not all lexicographic updating rules have a minimum distance representation, we study a sub-class of lexicographic rules, which we call "support-dependent" rules, which admit a minimum distance representation. Finally, we apply our approach to the problem of updating preferences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Ignition by moving hot spheres in H-2-O-2-N-2 environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Hot particle ignition; Hydrogen; Interferometry; Numerical simulation	MIXTURES; PARTICLES	A combined experimental and numerical study was carried out to investigate thermal ignition by millimeter size (d = 6 mm) moving hot spheres in H-2-O-2-N-2 environments over a range of equivalence ratios. The mixtures investigated were diluted with N-2 to keep their laminar flame speed constant and comparable to the sphere fall velocity (2.4 m/s) at time of contact with the reactive mixture. The ignition thresholds (and confidence intervals) were found by applying a logistic regression to the data and were observed to increase from lean (Phi = 0.39; T-sphere = 963 K) to rich (Phi = 1.35; T-sphere = 1007 K) conditions. Experimental temperature fields of the gas surrounding the hot sphere during an ignition event were, for the first time, extracted using interferometry and compared against simulated fields. Numerical predictions of the ignition thresholds were within 2% of the experimental values and captured the experimentally observed increasing trend between lean and rich conditions. The effect of stoichiometry and dilution on the observed variation in ignition threshold was explained using 0-D constant pressure delay time computations. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute.

J	Beardsell, G; Blanquart, G				Beardsell, Guillaume; Blanquart, Guillaume			Impact of pressure fluctuations on the dynamics of laminar premixed flames	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Laminar flames; Thermo-acoustic instabilities; Direct numerical simulations; Detailed chemistry	UNSTEADY RESPONSE	Thermo-acoustic instabilities are problematic in the design of continuous-combustion propulsion systems such as gas turbine engines, rocket motors, jet engine afterburners, and ramjets. Conceptually, the coupling between acoustics and flame dynamics can be divided into two categories: flame area fluctuations and changes in the local flame speed. The latter can be caused by the thermodynamic fluctuations that accompany an acoustic wave. This coupling is the focus of the present work. In this paper, we are concerned with the dynamics of laminar premixed flames involving large hydrocarbon species. Through high-fidelity numerical simulations, we investigate the flame response for a wide range of fuels and acoustic frequencies. The combustion of hydrogen and methane is considered for verification purposes and as baseline cases for comparison with two large hydrocarbon fuels, n-heptane and n-dodecane. We extract the phase and gain of the unsteady heat release response, which are directly related to the Rayleigh criterion and thus the stability of the system. For all fuels, we observe a local peak in the heat release gain. At high frequencies, we find that the fluctuations of the different species mass fractions decrease with the inverse of the acoustic frequency, leading to chemistry being "frozen" in the high-frequency limit. This allows us to predict the flame behavior directly from the steady-state solution. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Schlup, J; Blanquart, G				Schlup, Jason; Blanquart, Guillaume			Reproducing curvature effects due to differential diffusion in tabulated chemistry for premixed flames	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Tabulated chemistry; Soret effect; Non-constant Lewis number; Direct numerical simulation	DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; LOW-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS; TURBULENT; FUEL; MODEL	Tabulated chemistry reduces the cost of modeling reacting flows by transporting fewer scalars. It also has the benefit of introducing fewer terms that must be closed for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation modeling. In this study of premixed lean hydrogen-air flames, an extension to an existing tabulated chemistry model was developed by including differential diffusion and thermal diffusion of multiple species, using a mixture-averaged diffusion model. The transport equations for the tabulation variables (a progress variable and a mixture fraction-like variable) have been formulated, and curvature effects are intrinsic to the transport equations derived from first principles. The mathematical derivation is general, such that other fuel/air mixtures could be examined. The new tabulated chemistry model was then validated using a range of configurations, including flames with curvature, extinction, and hot spots. The model validation indicated excellent agreement with detailed chemistry simulations for lean premixed hydrogen-air mixtures. Conditional means of the progress variable source term were shown to agree well with detailed chemistry simulations of two-dimensional freely propagating flames and three-dimensional turbulent flames.

Quantifying the dynamics of O-GlcNAcylation in a proteome-wide level is critical for uncovering cellular mechanisms and functional roles of O-GlcNAcylation in cells. Here, we develop an isotope-coded photocleavable probe for profiling protein O-GlcNAcylation dynamics using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This probe enables selective tagging and isotopic labeling of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in one step from complex cellular mixtures. We demonstrate the application of the probe to quantitatively profile O-GlcNAcylation sites in 293T cells upon chemical induction of O-GlcNAc levels. We further applied the probe to quantitatively analyze the stoichiometry of O-GlcNAcylation between sorafenib-sensitive and sorafenib-resistant liver cancer cells, which lays the foundation for mechanistic investigation of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating cancer chemoresistance. Thus, this probe provides a powerful tool to profile O-GlcNAcylation dynamics in cells.

Gas-Diffusion Electrodes for Carbon Dioxide Reduction: A New Paradigm	ACS ENERGY LETTERS			English	Article							ELECTROCHEMICAL CO2 REDUCTION; PEM FUEL-CELL; POLYCRYSTALLINE COPPER; OXYGEN REDUCTION; CATHODE CATALYST; FORMIC-ACID; ELECTROREDUCTION; INSIGHTS; ELECTROLYSIS; MULTICARBON	Significant advances have been made in recent years discovering new electrocatalysts and developing a fundamental understanding of electrochemical CO2 reduction processes. This field has progressed to the point that efforts can now focus on translating this knowledge toward the development of practical CO, electrolyzers, which have the potential to replace conventional petrochemical processes as a sustainable route to produce fuels and chemicals. In this Perspective, we take a critical look at the progress in incorporating electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts into practical device architectures that operate using vapor-phase CO2 reactants, thereby overcoming intrinsic limitations of aqueous-based systems. Performance comparison is made between state-of-the-art CO2 electrolyzers and commercial H2O electrolyzers a well-established technology that provides realistic performance targets. Beyond just higher rates, vapor fed reactors represent new paradigms for unprecedented control of local reaction conditions, and we provide a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for generating fundamental knowledge and achieving technological progress toward the development of practical CO2 electrolyzers.

KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright (V similar to 11.1) Sun-like G2V star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of P = 1.3866529 +/- 0.0000027 days, a radius of R-P = 1.285(-0.071)(+0.12) R-J, and a relatively large mass of M-P = 3.47(-0.14)(+0.15), M-J. The star has R-star = 1.099(-0.046)(0.079) R-circle dot, M-star = 1.092(-0.041)(+0.045) M-circle dot, T-eff = 5767(-49)(+50) K, log g(star) = 4.393(-0.060)(+0.039) (cgs), and [m/H] = +0.259(-0.083)(+0.085); thus other than its slightly super-solar metallicity, it appears to be a near-solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits kinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin-disk stars. Nevertheless, the star is rotating rapidly for its estimated age, and shows evidence of chromospheric activity. Imaging reveals a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected separation of 6 '' (similar to 1400 au). In addition to the orbital motion caused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in the radial velocity of KELT-22A, suggesting the presence of another relatively nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a consequence of the small semimajor axis of a/R-star, and is mildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant. The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidal dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces, the semimajor axis is decreasing rapidly, and KELT-22Ab is predicted to spiral into the star within the next Gyr.

We develop and apply a general matrix method and identify a new fluid instability that occurs only when the acceleration magnitude exceeds a threshold value depending on the fluids' density ratio and uniform velocities and the perturbation wavelength. The dynamics conserves the fluxes of mass, momentum and energy, has potential velocity fields in the bulk, and is shear-free at the interface. The interface stability is set by the interplay of inertia and acceleration. Surface tension may also stabilize the dynamics by a distinct mechanism. The growth rate, the flow fields' structure and stabilization mechanisms of this new fluid instability depart substantially from those of other instabilities, thus suggesting new opportunities for the understanding, diagnostics, and control of interfacial dynamics.

However, the recent measurement of the noble gas composition of ice sublimating from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission calls for novel experiments regarding the mechanisms of noble gas trapping and evolution in cometary ice analogues. Here, we investigated the ionization dynamics of Xe atoms interacting with water ice using the recently developed Resonant TwoStep Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry (2S-LAI-MS). Xenon-water mixed ice was ablated with an infrared beam set on the maximum absorption wavelength for water (lambda = 2948 nm) at which xenon atoms are kept neutral. Subsequent multiple ionization of xenon and oxygen resulted in periodic Coulomb explosions of Xen+ components (n is an element of [1;6]) and ionized water degradation products (OH+, H+, O+, O2+, O3+). Such explosions could only be detected when Xe and water were mixed together in ice, and not when separated in two overlaid layers. This paper discusses the potential mechanisms accounting for the generation of Coulomb explosions in these experiments and its relevance to cometary ice at closer distances to perihelion. We conclude that multiple ionization of xenon and oxygen in our experiment may be due to electron impact processes resembling cometary electron and ion bombardment, whereby energetic particles of hundreds of eV to a few keV are accelerated towards the comet's nucleus. Electron and ion bombardment could induce significant chemical modifications to, and potentially outgassing from, the cometary surface.

Ignition of hydrogen-air mixtures under volumetric expansion	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Ignition; Hydrogen; Expansion; Chemical kinetics	DIRECT INITIATION	A better understanding of chemical kinetics under volumetric expansion is important for a number of situations relevant to industrial safety including detonation diffraction and direct initiation, reflected shock-ignition at obstacles, ignition behind a decaying shock, among others. The ignition of stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixtures was studied using 0D numerical simulations with time-dependent specific volume variations. The competition between chemical energy release and expansion-induced cooling was characterized for different cooling rates and mathematical forms describing the shock decay rate. The critical conditions for reaction quenching were systematically determined, and the thermo-chemistry dynamics were analyzed near the critical conditions. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute.

Particle transport mechanics and induced seismic noise in steep flume experiments with accelerometer-embedded tracers	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						river; bedload; seismology; laboratory; experiments; mechanics	BED-LOAD TRANSPORT; FLUVIAL BEDROCK EROSION; FLOW RESISTANCE; RIVER INCISION; SALTATION; MOTION; HYSTERESIS; INSIGHTS; STREAMS; GRAINS	Recent advances in fluvial seismology have provided solid observational and theoretical evidence that near-river seismic ground motion may be used to monitor and quantify coarse sediment transport. However, inversions of sediment transport rates from seismic observations have not been fully tested against independent measurements, and thus have unknown but potentially large uncertainties. In the present study, we provide the first robust test of existing theory by conducting dedicated sediment transport experiments in a flume laboratory under fully turbulent and rough flow conditions. We monitor grain-scale physics with the use of 'smart rocks' that consist of accelerometers embedded into manufactured rocks, and we quantitatively link bedload mechanics and seismic observations under various prescribed flow and sediment transport conditions. From our grain-scale observations, we find that bedload grain hop times are widely distributed, with impacts being on average much more frequent than predicted by existing saltation models. Impact velocities are observed to be a linear function of average downstream cobble velocities, and both velocities show a bed-slope dependency that is not represented in existing saltation models. Incorporating these effects in an improved bedload-induced seismic noise model allows sediment flux to be inverted from seismic noise within a factor of two uncertainty. This result holds over nearly two orders of magnitude of prescribed sediment fluxes with different sediment sizes and channel-bed slopes, and particle-particle collisions observed at the highest investigated rates are found to have negligible effect on the generated seismic power. These results support the applicability of the seismic-inversion framework to mountain rivers, although further experiments remain to be conducted at sediment transport near transport capacity.

Finite Correlation Length Implies Efficient Preparation of Quantum Thermal States	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							COMPUTATION; STABILITY	Preparing quantum thermal states on a quantum computer is in general a difficult task. We provide a procedure to prepare a thermal state on a quantum computer with a logarithmic depth circuit of local quantum channels assuming that the thermal state correlations satisfy the following two properties: (i) the correlations between two regions are exponentially decaying in the distance between the regions, and (ii) the thermal state is an approximate Markov state for shielded regions. We require both properties to hold for the thermal state of the Hamiltonian on any induced subgraph of the original lattice. Assumption (ii) is satisfied for all commuting Gibbs states, while assumption (i) is satisfied for every model above a critical temperature. Both assumptions are satisfied in one spatial dimension. Moreover, both assumptions are expected to hold above the thermal phase transition for models without any topological order at finite temperature. As a building block, we show that exponential decay of correlation (for thermal states of Hamiltonians on all induced subgraphs) is sufficient to efficiently estimate the expectation value of a local observable. Our proof uses quantum belief propagation, a recent strengthening of strong sub-additivity, and naturally breaks down for states with topological order.	[Brandao, Fernando G. S.

It is shown that at terahertz frequencies, conventional PSF measurement techniques are limited by the presence of strong scattering response of background objects, such as suspension threads, within the imaging field-of-view (FOV). Using acoustic levitation, it is possible to eliminate secondary objects within the FOV and achieve a pure PSF characterization of the radar. It is shown that the PSF patterns obtained using acoustic levitation exhibit high fidelity and are free from artifacts. We demonstrate this using a small water droplet suspended in air at the focus of the 340-GHz radar. The measured PSF characteristics of the radar are in excellent agreement with physical optics (PO) simulations and analytical results.

The lens antenna is based on the concept presented by Llombart et al. in 2011, a leaky-wave waveguide feed in order to achieve wide angle scanning and seamless integration with the receiver. The lens is translated from the origin of the waveguide producing the scanning of the beam over a 50 degrees field of view (FoV) (or about 6.25 beamwidths) with a maximum scanning loss of 1 dB. The lens movement is achieved with a piezoelectric motor that is integrated within the antenna and receiver block. A prototype was built and measured at 550 GHz achieving scanning beam angles close to 20 degrees with only 0.6 dB of loss. The scanning of the 50 degrees FoV, which corresponds to a lens displacement of approximately 2 mm, takes about 0.9 s achieving a scanning rate of 0.75 Hz of the FoV. The accuracy in continuous mode of the piezoactuator has been measured to be less than 28 mu m in the worse of cases for displacements of 2 mm, which corresponds to a beam steering of 0.76 degrees, much smaller than the antenna half-power beamvvidth of 8 degrees.

J	Mikellides, IG; Ortega, AL				Mikellides, Ioannis G.; Ortega, Alejandro Lopez			Challenges in the development and verification of first-principles models in Hall-effect thruster simulations that are based on anomalous resistivity and generalized Ohm's law	PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Hall thruster; anomalous transport; plasma simulations; electric propulsion; 2D (r-z) hydrodynamic multifluid simulation; anisotropic plasma; ion accelerator		Since the inception of the Hall-effect thruster more than five decades ago, many theories have been proposed about the source(s) of the anomalous cross-field transport that is known to occur in these devices. Yet, none of these theories has been implemented in two-dimensional (2D) (r-z) simulations and successfully predicted the behavior of the discharge and the erosion of a thruster over different operating conditions and geometries. We present results from numerical experiments with a 2D (r-z) axisymmetric hydrodynamics code that show the plasma solution is relatively insensitive to very large variations in the anomalous transport in some regions of the discharge channel and near-plume. Because the changes of the plasma properties in these regions can be too small or impossible to detect in the laboratory by conventional diagnostics, the verification of a transport model becomes very challenging. Hence, without more advanced diagnostics and improved numerical models, comparisons between plasma measurements and simulation results can lead to wide-ranging theories and scalings of the anomalous resistivity.

Anisotropic Quantum Well Electro-Optics in Few-Layer Black Phosphorus	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Electro-optic tunability; black phosphorus; broadband; anisotropy; van der Waals materials	MODULATION; PHOTODETECTOR; RADIATION; PLASMONS; PHASE	The incorporation of electrically tunable materials into photonic structures such as waveguides and metasurfaces enables dynamic, electrical control of light propagation at the nanoscale. Few-layer black phosphorus is a promising material for these applications due to its in-plane anisotropic, quantum well band structure, with a direct band gap that can be tuned from 0.3 to 2 eV with a number of layers and subbands that manifest as additional optical transitions across a wide range of energies. In this Letter, we report an experimental investigation of three different, anisotropic electro-optic mechanisms that allow electrical control of the complex refractive index in few-layer black phosphorus from the mid-infrared to the visible: Pauli-blocking of intersubband optical transitions (the Burstein-Moss effect); the quantum-confined Stark effect; and the modification of quantum well selection rules by a symmetry-breaking, applied electric field. These effects generate near-unity tuning of the BP oscillator strength for some material thicknesses and photon energies, along a single in-plane crystal axis, transforming absorption from highly anisotropic to nearly isotropic. Lastly, the anisotropy of these electro-optical phenomena results in dynamic control of linear dichroism and birefringence, a promising concept for active control of the complex polarization state of light, or propagation direction of surface waves.

Nitrogen incorporation in silicates and metals: Results from SIMS, EPMA, FTIR, and laser-extraction mass spectrometry	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						SIMS; nitrogen; speciation; FTIR; EPMA; bonding; carbon	ELECTRON-PROBE MICROANALYSIS; HIGH-PRESSURE; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; OXYGEN FUGACITY; BASALTIC MELT; MAGMA OCEAN; NOBLE-GASES; SOLUBILITY; HYDROGEN; VOLATILES	A quantitative understanding of nitrogen incorporation in Earth materials is important for constraining volatile evolution in planetary bodies. We used a combination of chemical (SIMS, EPMA, and laser-extraction mass spectrometry) and spectroscopic (FTIR) observations to study nitrogen contents and speciation mechanisms in silicate glasses, metal alloys, and an N-bearing silicate mineral (hyalophane). One suite of Fe-free basaltic glasses was studied by all four methods. Concentrations of N in these glasses determined by EPMA are systematically higher than those measured by laser extraction but agree within mutual 2s uncertainties, demonstrating the general veracity of the EPMA method. SIMS working curves based on measurement of N-14(+) and (NO-)-N-14-O-16 as a function of N content determined by EPMA (or laser extraction) are best fit with exponential functions rather than the linear regressions that are most commonly applied to SIMS data. On the other hand, the relationship based on (CN-)-C-12-N-14 for C-poor, Fe-free glasses is exceptionally well fit to a linear regression (r(2) = 1, p < 0.001), in contrast to expectations from previous work on glasses with lower N contents. Matrix effects on the SIMS signals associated with Fe or H2O content are not justified by the data, but volatile data (both N and H) for hyalophane, which contains 20 wt% BaO, reveal matrix effects possibly induced by its high average molar mass. A combination of FTIR and chemical data, together with a thorough review of the literature, was used to determine incorporation mechanisms for N in the Fe-free glasses. We infer that under reducing conditions at high pressure and temperature N is dissolved in basaltic melts chiefly as NH2- and NH2-, with N-2 and/or nitride (X-N3-) complexes becoming increasingly important at low fO(2), increasing N content, and decreasing H content. Our results have implications for future studies seeking to accurately measure N by SIMS and for studies of N partitioning at high pressure relevant to planetary accretion and differentiation.

The classical crystallization model mainly involves the monomer-by-monomer addition of simple chemical species. Recently, nanoparticle attachment has been realized as an important mechanism of crystallization in comparatively low-temperature aqueous natural and synthetic systems. However, no evidence of crystallization by particle attachment has been reported in petrologically important melts. In this study, we described spherical (Mg, Fe)-oxides with a protrusion surface in a shock-induced melt pocket from the martian meteorite Northwest Africa 7755. Transmission electron microscopic observations demonstrate that the (Mg, Fe)-oxides are structure-coherent intergrowth of ferropericlase and magnesioferrite. The magnesioferrite is mainly present adjacent to the interface between (Mg, Fe)-oxides spherules and surrounding silicate glass, but not in direct contact with the silicate glass. Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations suggest that development of the spherical (Mg, Fe)-oxides can be best interpreted with crystallization by particle attachment and subsequent Ostwald ripening. This indicates that crystallization by particle attachment can also take place in high-temperature melts and has potential implications for understanding the nucleation and growth of early-stage crystals in high-temperature melts, such as chondrules in the solar nebula, erupted volcanic melts, and probably even intrusive magmas.

Real-Time, Digital LAMP with Commercial Microfluidic Chips Reveals the Interplay of Efficiency, Speed, and Background Amplification as a Function of Reaction Temperature and Time	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MEDIATED ISOTHERMAL AMPLIFICATION; QUANTIFICATION; DNA	Real-time, isothermal, digital nucleic acid amplification is emerging as an attractive approach for a multitude of applications including diagnostics, mechanistic studies, and assay optimization. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available and affordable real-time, digital instrument validated for isothermal amplification; thus, most researchers have not been able to apply digital, real-time approaches to isothermal amplification. Here, we generate an approach to real-time digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using commercially available microfluidic chips and reagents and open-source components. We demonstrate this approach by testing variables that influence LAMP reaction speed and the probability of detection. By analyzing the interplay of amplification efficiency, background, and speed of amplification, this real-time digital method enabled us to test enzymatic performance over a range of temperatures, generating high-precision kinetic and end-point measurements. We were able to identify the unique optimal temperature for two polymerase enzymes while accounting for amplification efficiency, nonspecific background, and time to threshold. We validated this digital LAMP assay and pipeline by performing a phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test on 17 archived clinical urine samples from patients diagnosed with urinary tract infections. We provide all the necessary workflows to perform digital LAMP using standard laboratory equipment and commercially available materials. This real-time digital approach will be useful to others in the future to understand the fundamentals of isothermal chemistries, including which components determine amplification fate, reaction speed, and enzymatic performance. Researchers can also adapt this pipeline, which uses only standard equipment and commercial components, to quickly study and optimize assays using precise, real-time digital quantification, accelerating development of critically needed diagnostics.

In the proposed structure, alumina spheres with square lattices are embedded into cardboards. Multipole modes of spherical particles are excited by incident plane waves. Lattice-tailored interactions can enhance or eliminate forward or backward scatterings of particle arrays to realize transparency or opacity properties. Non-resonant and resonant interactions are investigated in detail, and results indicate a large group delay can be obtained by resonant Kerker transparency. The proposed methodology shows robustness and application potentials from the microwave to optical band.

Automatic Detection and Tracking of Plumes from 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in Rosetta/OSIRIS Image Sequences	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						comets: general; comets: individual (67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko); methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing	OSIRIS	Solar system bodies such as comets and asteroids are known to eject material from their surface in the form of jets and plumes. Observations of these transient outbursts can offer insight into the inner workings and makeup of their originating body. However, the detection of and response to these events has thus far been manually controlled by ground operations, limiting the response time, due to the light time delay of ground communications. For distant bodies, the delay can exceed the duration of temporary events, making it impossible to respond with follow-up observations. To address this need, we developed a computer vision methodology for detecting plumes of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from imagery acquired by the OSIRIS scientific camera system. While methods exist for the automatic detection of plumes on spherical and near-convex solar system bodies, this is the first work that addresses the case of highly irregularly shaped bodies such as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Our work is divided into two distinct components: an image processing pipeline that refines a model-based estimate of the nucleus body, and an iterative plume detection algorithm that finds regions of local intensity maxima and joins plume segments across successively higher altitudes. Finally, we validate this method by comparing automatically labeled images to those labeled by hand, and find no significant differences in variability. This technique has utility in both ground-based analysis of plume sequences as well as onboard applications, such as isolating short sequences of high activity for priority downloading or triggering follow-up observations with additional instruments.

It is surrounded by a prominent and complex debris disk that is likely stirred by one or several gas giant exoplanets. The discovery of the RV signature of a giant exoplanet was announced 15 yr ago, but has met with scrutiny due to possible confusion with stellar noise. We confirm the planet with a new compilation and analysis of precise RV data spanning 30 yr, and combine it with upper limits from our direct imaging search, the most sensitive ever performed. The deep images were taken in the Ms band (4.7 mu m) with the vortex coronagraph recently installed in W.M. Keck Observatory's infrared camera NIRC2, which opens a sensitive window for planet searches around nearby adolescent systems. The RV data and direct imaging upper limit maps were combined in an innovative joint Bayesian analysis, providing new constraints on the mass and orbital parameters of the elusive planet. epsilon Eridani b has a mass of 0.78(-0.12)(+0.38) M-Jup and is orbiting epsilon Eridani at about 3.48 +/- 0.02 au with a period of 7.37 +/- 0.07 yr. The eccentricity of epsilon Eridani b's orbit is 0.07(-0.05)(+0.06) an order of magnitude smaller than early estimates and consistent with a circular orbit. We discuss our findings from the standpoint of planet-disk interactions and prospects for future detection and characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope.

We use a sample of 28 clusters and associations with ages from similar to 1-5 Myr, where lists of members are available from previous X-ray, optical, and infrared studies. Proper motions from Gaia DR2 reveal that at least 75% of these systems are expanding; however, rotation is only detected in one system. Typical expansion velocities are on the order of similar to 0.5 km s(-1), and in several systems, there is a positive radial gradient in expansion velocity. Systems that are still embedded in molecular clouds are less likely to be expanding than those that are partially or fully revealed. One-dimensional velocity dispersions, which range from sigma(1D) = 1 to 3 km s(-1), imply that most of the stellar systems in our sample are supervirial and that some are unbound. In star-forming regions that contain multiple clusters or subclusters, we find no evidence that these groups are coalescing, implying that hierarchical cluster assembly, if it occurs, must happen rapidly during the embedded stage.

Discovery of delta Scuti Pulsations in the Young Hybrid Debris Disk Star HD 156623	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						open clusters and associations: individual (Upper Centaurus-Lupus, Sco-Cen); stars: early-type; stars: individual (HD 156623); stars: oscillations; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: delta Scuti	A-TYPE STARS; MAIN-SEQUENCE; BOLOMETRIC CORRECTIONS; ROTATIONAL VELOCITIES; EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE; MODEL ATMOSPHERES; TELESCOPE; PHOTOMETRY; CATALOG; COLORS	The bRing robotic observatory network was built to search for circumplanetary material within the transiting Hill sphere of the exoplanet beta Pic b across its bright host star beta Pic. During the bRing survey of beta Pic, it simultaneously monitored the brightnesses of thousands of bright stars in the southern sky (V similar or equal to 4-8, delta less than or similar to 30 degrees). In this work, we announce the discovery of delta Scuti pulsations in the A-type star HD 156623 using bRing data. HD 156623 is notable as it is a well-studied young star with a dusty and gas-rich debris disk, previously detected using ALMA. We present the observational results on the pulsation periods and amplitudes for HD 156623, discuss its evolutionary status, and provide further constraints on its nature and age. We find strong evidence of frequency regularity and grouping. We do not find evidence of frequency, amplitude, or phase modulation for any of the frequencies over the course of the observations. We show that HD 156623 is consistent with other hot and high-frequency pre-main sequence and early zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) delta Scutis as predicted by theoretical models and corresponding evolutionary tracks, although we observe that HD 156623 lies hotter than the theoretical blue edge of the classical instability strip. This, coupled with our characterization and Sco-Cen membership analyses, suggests that the star is most likely an outlying ZAMS member of the similar to 16 Myr Upper Centaurus-Lupus subgroup of the Sco-Cen association.

NuSTAR and Keck Observations of Heavily Obscured Quasars Selected by WISE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SUPERMASSIVE BLACK-HOLES; X-RAY-SPECTRA; GALAXY MERGERS; SPACE DENSITY; LINE SPECTRA; HALO MASSES; 3C 273; LUMINOSITY; AGN	A primary aim of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission is to find and characterize heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Based on mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, we have selected a large population of luminous obscured AGNs (i.e., "obscured quasars"). Here we report NuSTAR observations of four WISE-selected heavily obscured quasars for which we have optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and W. M. Keck Observatory. Optical diagnostics confirm that all four targets are AGNs. With NuSTAR hard X-ray observations, three of the four objects are undetected, while the fourth has a marginal detection. We confirm that these objects have observed hard X-ray (10-40 keV) luminosities at or below similar to 10(43) erg s(-1). We compare X-ray and IR luminosities to obtain estimates of the hydrogen column densities (N-H) based on the suppression of the hard X-ray emission. We estimate N-H of these quasars to be at or larger than 10(25) cm(-2), confirming that WISE and optical selection can identify very heavily obscured quasars that may be missed in X-ray surveys, and they do not contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background. From the optical Balmer decrements, we found that our three extreme obscured targets lie in highly reddened host environments. This galactic extinction cannot adequately explain the more obscured AGNs, but it may imply a different scale of obscuration in the galaxy.

HAWC Sci Team	SOFIA Far-infrared Imaging Polarimetry of M82 and NGC 253: Exploring the Supergalactic Wind	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: starburst; instrumentation: polarimeters	MAGNETIC-FIELD GEOMETRY; STAR-FORMATION; COSMIC-RAY; POLARIZATION; EMISSION; RADIO; GALAXIES; NGC-253; NEBULA; ORIGIN	We present far-infrared polarimetry observations of M82 at 53 and 154 mu m and NGC 253 at 89 mu m, which were taken with High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) in polarimetry mode on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. The polarization of M82 at 53 mu m clearly shows a magnetic field geometry perpendicular to the disk in the hot dust emission. For M82 the polarization at 154 mu m shows a combination of field geometry perpendicular to the disk in the nuclear region, but closer to parallel to the disk away from the nucleus. The fractional polarization at 53 mu m (154 mu m) ranges from 7% (3%) off nucleus to 0.5% (0.3%) near the nucleus. A simple interpretation of the observations of M82 invokes a massive polar outflow, dragging the field along, from a region similar to 700 pc in diameter that has entrained some of the gas and dust, creating a vertical field geometry seen mostly in the hotter (53 mu m) dust emission. This outflow sits within a larger disk with a more typical planar geometry that more strongly contributes to the cooler (154 mu m) dust emission. For NGC 253, the polarization at 89 mu m is dominated by a planar geometry in the tilted disk, with weak indication of a vertical geometry above and below the plane from the nucleus. The polarization observations of NGC 253 at 53 mu m were of a insufficient signal-to-noise ratio for a detailed analysis.

The pure rotational spectrum of YbOH	CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article						YbOH rotational spectrum	SPECTROSCOPY	The pure rotational spectrum of YbOH has been recorded and analyzed to produce fine and magnetic hyperfine parameters for the (X) over tilde (2)Sigma(+)(0, 0, 0) state. These parameters are compared with those determined from the optical study (Melville and Coxon, 2001) and with the values for YbF (Dickinson et al., 2001). The results support the existence of an unobserved perturbing state near the (A) over tilde (2)Pi(1/2) state, similar to that previously found in YbF. The precisely determining parameters lays the foundation for laser cooling YbOH, which will aid in the search for new physics beyond the standard model.

However, considerable uncertainty exists concerning the chemical mechanism leading to BrC formation and their optical properties. In this work, BrC particles were prepared from mixtures of small alpha-dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) and amines (methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine). The absorption and scattering of BrC particles were measured using a photoacoustic extinctometer (405 and 532 nm), and the chemical composition of the alpha-dicarbonyl-amine mixtures was analyzed using orbitrap-mass spectrometry and thermal desorption-ion drift-chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The single scattering albedo for methylglyoxal-amine mixtures is smaller than that of glyoxal-amine mixtures and increases with the methyl substitution of amines. The mass absorption cross-section for methylglyoxal-amine mixtures is two times higher at 405 nm wavelength than that at 532 nm wavelength. The derived refractive indexes at the 405 nm wavelength are 1.40-1.64 for the real part and 0.002-0.195 for the imaginary part. Composition analysis in the alpha-dicarbonyl-amine mixtures reveals N-heterocycles as the dominant products, which are formed via multiple steps involving nucleophilic attack, steric hindrance, and dipole dipole interaction between alpha-dicarbonyls and amines. BrC aerosols, if formed from the particle-phase reaction of methylglyoxal with methylamine, likely contribute to atmospheric warming.

Although substantial progress has been made for basaltic lavas our understanding of silicic lava flows has seen limited recent advance. In particular, the formation of lava flow breakouts, which represent a characteristic process in cooling-limited basaltic lavas, but has not been described in established models of rhyolite emplacement. Using data from the 2011-2012 rhyolite eruption of Puyehue-CordOn Caulle, Chile, we develop the first conceptual framework to classify breakout types in silicic lavas, and to describe the processes involved in their progressive growth, inflation, and morphological change. By integrating multi-scale satellite, field, and textural data from Cordon Caulle, we interpret breakout formation to be driven by a combination of pressure increase (from local vesiculation in the lava flow core, as well as from continued supply via extended thermally preferential pathways) and a weakening of the surface crust through lateral spreading and fracturing. Small breakouts, potentially resulting more from local vesiculation than from continued magma supply, show a domed morphology, developing into petaloid as inflation increasingly fractures the surface crust. Continued growth and fracturing results in a rubbly morphology, with the most inflated breakouts developing into a cleft-split morphology, reminiscent of tumulus inflation structures seen in basalts. These distinct morphological classes result from the evolving relative contributions of continued breakout advance and inflation. The extended nature of some breakouts highlights the role of lava supply under a stationary crust, a process ubiquitous in inflating basalt lava flows that reflects the presence of thermally preferential pathways. Textural analyses of the Cordon Caulle breakouts also emphasize the importance of late-stage volatile exsolution and vesiculation within the lava flow. Although breakouts occur across the compositional spectrum of lava flows, the greater magma viscosity is likely to make late-stage vesiculation much more important for breakout development in silicic lavas than in basalts. Such late-stage vesiculation has direct implications for hazards previously recognized from silicic lava flows, enhancing the likelihood of flow front collapse, and explosive decompression of the lava core.

Strain patterns from Afar provide tests of current models of how segmented rifts grow in areas of incipient oceanic spreading. Here, we present a combined analysis of seismicity, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and GPS-derived strain rate maps to reveal that the plate-boundary linkage between the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifts of Afar is accommodated primarily by distributed extensional faulting. Large rotations about vertical axes predicted by bookshelf faulting models are not detected. Additionally, models of stress changes and seismicity induced by recent dikes provide poor fits to the observed time-space patterns of strike-slip earthquakes. Instead, we explain these features as resulting from rift-perpendicular shearing at the tips of spreading rifts where extension terminates against less stretched lithosphere. Our results demonstrate that distributed extension drives rift-perpendicular shearing, achieving plate-boundary linkage during incipient seafloor spreading.

J	de Kleer, K; de Pater, I; Adamkovics, M				de Kleer, Katherine; de Pater, Imke; Adamkovics, Mate			Emission from volcanic SO gas on Io at high spectral resolution	ICARUS			English	Article						Io; Volcanism; Satellites; Atmospheres; Spectroscopy; Infrared observations	ROVIBRONIC TRANSITION; ATMOSPHERE; FORBIDDEN; SPECTROGRAPH; VARIABILITY; CONSTRAINTS; ECLIPSE; PLUME	Jupiter's moon Io hosts a dynamic atmosphere that is continually stripped off and replenished through frost sublimation and volcanic outgassing. We observed an emission band at 1.707 mu m thought to be produced by hot SO molecules directly ejected from a volcanic vent; the observations were made with the NIRSPEC instrument on the Keck II telescope while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter on three nights in 2012-2016, and included two observations with 10 x higher spectral resolution than all prior observations of this band. These high-resolution spectra permit more complex and realistic modeling, and reveal a contribution to the SO emission from gas reservoirs at both high and low rotational temperatures. The scenario preferred by de Pater et al. (2002) for the source of the SO gas - direct volcanic emission of SO in the excited state - is consistent with these two temperature components if the local gas density is high enough that rotational energy can be lost collisionally before the excited electronic state spontaneously decays. Under this scenario, the required bulk atmospheric gas density and surface pressure are n similar to 10(11) cm(-3) and 1-3 nbar, consistent with observations and modeling of Io's dayside atmosphere at altitudes below 10 km (Lellouch et al., 2007; Walker et al., 2010). These densities and pressures would be too high for the nightside density if the atmospheric density drops by an order of magnitude or more at night (as predicted by sublimation-supported models), but recent results have shown a drop in SO2 gas density of only a factor of 5 +/- 2 (Tsang et al., 2016). While our observations taken immediately post-ingress and preegress (on different dates) prefer models with only a factor of 1.5 change in gas density, a factor of 5 change is still well within uncertainties. In addition, our derived gas densities are for the total bulk atmosphere, while Tsang et al. (2016) specifically measured SO2. The low-temperature gas component is warmer for observations in the first 20 min of eclipse (in Dec 2015) than after Io had been in shadow for 1.5 h (in May 2016), suggesting cooling of the atmosphere during eclipse. However, individual spectra during the first similar to 30 min of eclipse do not show a systematic cooling, indicating that such a cooling would have to take place on a longer timescale than the similar to 10 min for cooling of the surface (Tsang et al., 2016). Excess emission is consistently observed at 1.69 mu m, which cannot be matched by two-temperature gas models but can be matched by models that over-populate high rotational states. However, a detailed assessment of disequilibrium conditions will require high-resolution spectra that cover both the center of the band and the wing at 1.69 mu m. Finally, a comparison of the total band strengths observed across eight dates from 1999 to 2016 reveals no significant dependence on thermal hot spot activity (including Loki Patera), on the time since Io has been in shadow, nor on the phase of Io's orbit at the time of observation.

Atmospheric conditions diagnostic to the occurrence or non-occurrence of GDS were successfully simulated in 17 of the 22 Mars years of the available historic record. Statistical significance at the 99% level is obtained in a comparison of success rates between an occurrence model with stochastic forcing and those of the GCM forced by orbit-spin coupling.

A spectrophotometric study by means of Monte Carlo ray-tracing and Hapke's theory	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn; Rings; Radiative transfer; Spectrophotometry	INFRARED MAPPING SPECTROMETER; OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; FAR-ULTRAVIOLET; MU-M; PHASE; PHOTOMETRY; SIMULATIONS	This work is the second in a series of manuscripts devoted to the investigation of the spectrophotometric properties of Saturn's rings from Cassini-VIMS (Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) observations. The dataset used for this analysis is represented by ten radial spectrograms of the rings which have been derived in Filacchione et al. (2014) by radial mosaics produced by VIMS. Spectrograms report the measured radiance factor I/F of the main rings of Saturn as a function of both radial distance (from 73500 to 141375 km) and wavelength (0.35-5.1 mu m) for different observation geometries (phase angle ranging in the 2 degrees-132 degrees interval). We take advantage of a Monte Carlo ray-tracing routine (Ciarniello et al., 2014) to characterize the photometric behavior of the rings at each wavelength and derive the spectral Bond albedo of ring particles. This quantity is used to infer the composition of the regolith covering ring particles by applying Hapke's theory. Four different regions, characterized by different optical depths, and respectively located in the C ring, inner B ring, mid B ring and A ring, have been investigated. Results from photometric modeling indicate that, in the VIS-NIR spectral range, B ring particles are intrinsically brighter than A and C ring particles, with the latter having the lowest albedo, while the single particle phase function of the ring's particles is compatible with an Europa-like or Callisto-like formulation, depending on the investigated region. Spectral modeling of the inferred Bond albedo indicates that ring spectrum can be reproduced by water ice grains with inclusion of organic materials (tholin) as a UV absorber intimately mixed with variable amounts of other compounds in pure form (carbon, silicates) or embedded in water ice grains (nanophase hydrated iron oxides, carbon, silicates, crystalline hematite, metallic iron, troilite). The abundance of tholin decreases with radial distance from C ring (0.2-0.6%) to A ring (0.06%) for the selected regions. Its distribution is compatible with an intrinsic origin and is possibly related to the different plasma environment of the different ring regions. The identification of the other absorber(s) and its absolute volumetric abundance is uncertain, depending on the adopted grain size and mixing modality (intraparticle or intimate). However, assuming a common composition of the other absorber in the ring plane, we find that its abundance anti-correlates with the optical depth of the investigated regions, being maximum in the thinnest C ring and minimum in the thickest mid B ring. In the case of the C ring, an additional population of low-albedo grains is required to match the positive spectral slope of the continuum in the 0.55-2.2 pm interval, represented by an intraparticle mixture of water ice and a spectrum similar to troilite or metallic iron. The distribution of the darkening compounds is interpreted as the result of a contamination by exogenous material, which is more effective in the less dense regions of the rings because of their lower surface mass density of pure water ice.

J	Panning, MP; Kedar, S				Panning, Mark P.; Kedar, Sharon			Seismic response of the Mars Curiosity Rover: Implications for future planetary seismology	ICARUS			English	Article						Instrumentation; Geophysics; Interiors	NOISE; MISSION; SEISMOMETER; SURFACE	Seismic measurements are an important tool for exploration of planetary interiors, but may not be included in missions due to perceived complexity in placement of sensitive instruments on the surface. To help address this concern, we assess the fidelity of recordings of ground motion by an instrument placed on the deck of the engineering model of the Mars Science Laboratory compared with an identical instrument placed on the ground directly beneath. Comparison of the recordings reveals clear recordings of teleseismic earthquakes on both instruments. The transfer function between the instruments demonstrates the deck instrument is affected by resonance frequencies of the lander, and does not faithfully record ground motion at these frequencies or higher. In addition, additional decoherence is observed near 1 Hz during periods of strong airflow due to air conditioning cycling. However, excellent coherence and a transfer function near 1 can be observed in the important seismic band between 2 and 30 s at all times and extending up to the lander resonances during the night time when air conditioning was not running. This suggests a deck-mounted seismic instrument may be able to provide valuable science return without requiring additional deployment complexity.

Propene (propylene, C3H6) was first detected in 2013 with data from the Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument on Cassini. We present the first measured abundance profiles of propene on Titan from radiative transfer modeling, and compare our measurements to predictions derived from several photochemical models. Near the equator, propene is observed to have a peak abundance of 10 ppbv at a pressure of 0.2 mbar. Several photochemical models predict the amount at this pressure to be in the range 0.3-1 ppbv and also show a local minimum near 0.2 mbar which we do not see in our measurements. We also see that propene follows a different latitudinal trend than the other C-3 molecules. While propane and propyne concentrate near the winter pole, transported via a global convective cell, propene is most abundant above the equator. We retrieve vertical abundances profiles between 125 km and 375 km for these gases for latitude averages between 60 degrees S-20 degrees S, 20 degrees S-20 degrees N, and 20 degrees N-60 degrees N over two time periods, 2004 through 2009 representing Titan's atmosphere before the 2009 equinox, and 2012 through 2015 representing time after the equinox. Additionally, using newly corrected line data, we determined an updated upper limit for allene (propadiene, CH2CCH2, the isomer of propyne). We claim a 3-sigma upper limit mixing ratio of 2.5 x 10(-9) within 30 degrees of the equator. The measurements we present will further constrain photochemical models by refining reaction rates and the transport of these gases throughout Titan's atmosphere.

In order to measure the weak and narrow CO2 absorption band depths around 4.26 gm, we improved: (1) the calibration of VIMS spectra; (2) the calculation of geographic coordinates; and (3) the projection techniques. We averaged multiple observations of a given area to obtain a signal to noise ratio high enough to map the CO2 abundances. CO2 is reliably detected mostly in the South Polar Region. This region includes active faults (Tiger Stripes), the highest observed surface temperatures, and locations of active plume eruptions. The occurrence here of CO2 is consistent with an endogenic origin controlled by tectonics. Both pure CO2 ice and complexed CO2 are detected from the positions of absorption bands between 4.27 and 4.24 mu m. The highest concentrations of CO2 are between the main active faults of the South Polar Region, where the surface temperature is low. Pure CO2 ice deposits at the surface of Enceladus are best modeled by the formation of gas pockets below the icy crust and above the surface of the internal ocean. These pockets eventually release cold CO2 gas ( similar to 70 to similar to 119 K) at low-velocity (seeping) between the Tiger Stripes [Matson et al., 2018, Icarus, 302, 18 similar to 26]. CO2 clathrate hydrates may form in the ocean and may be subsequently released when a CO2 gas pocket blows out and erupts. Other mechanisms may contribute to reinforcing the anti-correlation of the CO2 distribution (of any type) with respect to the location of the Tiger Stripes, such as successive sublimation of CO2 and condensation on colder areas, and partial frost cover by H2O releases from plume eruptions.

VLA multi-wavelength microwave observations of Saturn's C and B rings	ICARUS			English	Article							INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SCATTERING; SYSTEM; WAVELENGTH; ANGLES; WAVES	We present multi-wavelength VLA observations in the microwave of Saturn's rings. The data were obtained over two observational windows and cover a range from the Q to S bands (0.7-13 cm). Key ring particle properties are determined in the C and B rings such as particle porosity and non-icy material fraction in order to compare them directly with previously derived results using the 2-cm Cassini RADAR radiometry data (Zhang et al., 2017a, b). We confirm that these new data are consistent with the particles in the C ring being quite porous with porosity values of roughly 75-90% depending on different scattering phase functions, as well as the presence of a "hot band" in the middle C ring which is associated with both an anomalously high non-icy material fraction and low opacity relative to the rest of the C ring. Furthermore, with our multi-wavelength study we find that the amount of intrinsic thermal emission is almost constant with wavelength, which is unexpected since particles tend to become more absorbing at higher frequencies. If we assume that the non-icy material in the rings is intramixed within the ring particles, this result suggests a corresponding decrease in the imaginary part of the non-icy material dielectric constant at higher frequencies, which is most noticeable in the middle C ring. We do not see evidence for such decrease in the B ring particles. If true, this supports the idea that the non-icy material in the middle C ring has a different origin, and that the larger particles in the middle C ring may be composed of a rocky core covered by a porous, icy mantle. If the non-icy materials in the middle C ring are embedded as large chunks, a core-mantle model for the ring particles there naturally explains this almost constant intrinsic thermal emission. Furthermore, because the VLA has more complete azimuthal angle coverage than the Cassini radiometry observations, we are able to investigate the ring brightness in more detail. In particular, we notice a flatter scattering profile than that predicted by using a pure Mie phase function at higher frequencies (Q and K bands; 0.7-1.3 cm) for azimuthal angles between vertical bar 40 vertical bar degrees and vertical bar 60 vertical bar degrees. We can match the observed scattering profile better by introducing a semi-empirical phase function for large particles to account for nonsphericity effects. Finally, the non-icy material fraction in the B ring is less than 1%, which is in agreement with that derived from Cassini observations. The frequency-dependence of the B ring thermal emission sets the lower limit of B ring particle porosity. We confirm that the B ring particles are likely over 80% porous, which at the same time explains the high opacity in the B ring as measured from density waves. Because we are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio, the optical depth of the middle B ring could be higher than the currently accepted values. However, we found that even if the middle B ring is six times more optically thick than the value measured from UVIS occultations, the surface mass density is still likely to be less than 300 g/cm(2,) while the exposure time to non-icy pollutants due to micrometeoroid bombardment is less than 200 Myr.

An initial assessment of the impact of postulated orbit-spin coupling on Mars dust storm variability in fully interactive dust simulations	ICARUS			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE; SURFACE; CYCLE; VIKING; REPRESENTATION; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; CLIMATE	A weak coupling between the rotational and orbital angular momenta of Mars has been postulated to produce a 'coupling term acceleration' (CTA) that accelerates the wind field and is asynchronous with the seasonal cycle of solar forcing (Shirley, 2017). This paper presents the first GCM simulations of a fully interactive dust cycle with the CTA included, enabling storm sizes, onset times and locations to be predicted. The inclusion of the CTA greatly augments interannual variability in the occurrence and timing of GDS, with the nature of the storm season strongly linked to the phasing and amplitude of the orbit-spin coupling. This dramatically improves the model's skill at predicting GDS and non-GDS Mars Years (MY) compared to a GCM without CTA forcing. The model is clearly wrong in only 4 out of 22 well-observed storm seasons and is able to capture the general onset time of most observed storms as well as some onset locations. In years when the CTA forcing has large positive amplitudes around perihelion, GDS with onset near perihelion occur due to a net strengthening of the single-cell Hadley circulation at this time, while earlier (or later) GDS are likely produced by more localized constructive interference between the CTA and tidal/topographic flows at a time of peak forcing amplitudes. The latter may be more sensitive to errors in the assumed surface dust availability, which may explain why a late GDS observed in MY 10 is not predicted. Depletion of surface dust in source regions by GDS in prior years may have prevented a GDS from occurring in the real MY 17, when a large GDS is incorrectly predicted. Early GDS are observed but not predicted in two MYs (12 and 25) with large negative CTA forcing amplitudes around perihelion, which may be associated with a lack of water cycle coupling in these simulations. Other missing physical processes, imperfect dust parameterizations or parameter values, the assumption of unlimited surface dust availability, or the wrong CTA strength may account for other mismatches. A GDS is predicted close to perihelion in the current storm season, MY34 (2018), with a smaller GDS predicted later next Mars year, MY35 (2020). The CTA forcing in MY 34 is very similar to that of MY 21, in which a GDS is correctly predicted by the model.	[Newman, C. E.; Lee, C.; Richardson, M.

Earth's Energy Imbalance Measured From Space	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Accelerometer; earth's energy imbalance; global warming; low earth orbit satellites; remote sensing	SEA-LEVEL BUDGET; ELECTROSTATIC ACCELEROMETER; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; ATMOSPHERE RADIATION; OUTGOING RADIATION; AERODYNAMIC LIFT; OCEAN; DECAY; ORBIT	The direct measurement of earth's energy imbalance (EEI) is one of the greatest challenges in climate research. The global mean EEI represents the integrated value of global warming and is tightly linked to changes in hydrological cycle and the habitability of our planet. Current space-born radiometers measure the individual radiative components of the energy balance with unprecedented stability, but with calibration errors too large to determine the absolute magnitude of global mean EEI as the components' residual. Best estimates of the long-term EEI are currently derived from temporal changes in ocean heat content at similar to 0.7 Wm(-2). To monitor EEI directly from space, we propose an independent approach based on accelerometry that measures nongravitational forces, such as radiation pressure, acting on earth-orbiting spacecrafts. The concept of deriving EEI from radiation pressure has been considered in the past, and we provide analysis that shows today's capabilities are sufficiently accurate to answer the question: At what rate is our planet warming? To measure global mean EEI to within at least +/- 0.3 Wm(-2) requires spacecraft(s) of near-spherical shape and well-characterized surface properties to reduce confounding effects. The proposed concept may provide the basis for a data record of global and zonal mean EEI on annual and potentially monthly timescales. It is not meant to replace the existing concepts designed to measure energy balance components or ocean heat storage, but to complement these by providing an independent estimate of EEI for comparison and to anchor data products and climate models that lack energy balance closure.

Both generators and controllable loads are utilized to recover nominal frequencies while minimizing regulation cost. We study two control modes: 1) the per-node balance mode and 2) the network balance mode. In Part I of this paper, we only consider the per-node balance case, where we derive a completely decentralized strategy without the need for communication between control areas. It can adapt to unknown load disturbance. The tie-line powers are restored after load disturbance, while the regulation capacity constraints are satisfied both at equilibrium and during transient. We show that the closed-loop systems with the proposed control strategies carry out primal-dual updates for solving the associated centralized frequency optimization problems. We further prove the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable and converge to the unique optimal solution of the centralized frequency optimization problems and their duals. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. In Part II of this paper, we address the network power balance case, m here transmission congestions are managed continuously.

In Part II of this paper, we propose a distributed controller for optimal frequency control in the network power balance case, where the power mismatch is balanced over the whole system. With the proposed controller, the tie-line powers remain within the acceptable range at equilibrium, while the regulation capacity constraints are satisfied both at equilibrium and during transient. It is revealed that the closed-loop system with the proposed controller carries out primal-dual updates with saturation for solving an associated optimization problem. to cope with discontinuous dynamics of the closed-loop system, we deploy the invariance principle for nonpathological Lyapunov function to prove its asymptotic stability. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our controller.

This brings great challenge to its optimal operation due to the difficulty of implementing a unified control. This paper addresses the distributed optimal control of de microgrids, which intends to break the restriction of diversity to some extent. First, we formulate the optimal power flow problem of stand-alone de microgrids as an exact second-order cone program and prove the uniqueness of the optimal solution. Then a dynamic solving algorithm based on primal-dual decomposition method is proposed, the convergence of which is proved theoretically as well as the optimality of its equilibrium point. It should be stressed that the algorithm can provide control commands for the three types of microgrids: 1) power control; 2) voltage control; and 3) droop control. This implies that each microgrid does not need to change its original control strategy in practice, which is less influenced by the diversity of microgrids. Moreover, the control commands for power controlled and voltage controlled microgrids satisfy generation limits and voltage limits in both transient process and steady state. Finally, a six-microgrid de system based on the microgrid benchmark is adopted to validate the effectiveness and plug-n-play property of our designs.

J	Cohen, N; Bhattacharya, K				Cohen, Noy; Bhattacharya, Kaushik			A numerical study of the electromechanical response of liquid metal embedded elastomers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS			English	Article								Liquid metal embedded elastomers (LMEE) are soft, stretchable materials that become conductive upon application of a compressive force. The conductance stems from the compression-induced percolation of the liquid metal inclusions. Interestingly, a recent work showed that once the elastomer becomes conductive, its resistance is independent of stretch. This work aims to understand these phenomena. We start by simulating the response of an elastomer composite with two soft inclusions subjected to a compressive force. It is shown that the presence of the inclusions can give rise to a tensile stress in the elastomer, leading to rupture and percolation. Next, we study the dependence of the resistance and the conductivity on an applied uniaxial stretch in LMEEs with several microstructures. The simulations are in good qualitative agreement with experimental findings. It is also demonstrated that the electromechanical properties highly depend on the microstructural arrangement of the inclusions and can therefore be tuned by microstructural design.

High-precision measurements of krypton and xenon isotopes with a new static-mode quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							NOBLE-GASES; PHASE-Q; U-PB; ATMOSPHERE; EVOLUTION; RELAX; MARS; XE	Measuring the abundance and isotopic composition of noble gases in planetary atmospheres can answer fundamental questions in cosmochemistry and comparative planetology. However, noble gases are rare elements, a feature making their measurement challenging even on Earth. Furthermore, in space applications, power consumption, volume and mass constraints on spacecraft instrument accommodations require the development of compact innovative instruments able to meet the engineering requirements of the mission while still meeting the science requirements. Here we demonstrate the ability of the quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (QITMS) developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech, Pasadena) to measure low quantities of heavy noble gases (Kr, Xe) in static operating mode and in the absence of a buffer gas such as helium. The sensitivity reaches 10(13) cps Torr(-1) (about 10(11) cps Pa-1) of gas (Kr or Xe). The instrument is able to measure gas in static mode for extended periods of time (up to 48 h) enabling the acquisition of thousands of isotope ratios per measurement. Errors on isotope ratios follow predictions of the counting statistics and the instrument provides reproducible results over several days of measurements. For example, 1.7 x 10(-10) Torr (2.3 x 10(-8) Pa) of Kr measured continuously for 7 hours yielded a 0.6 parts per thousand precision on the Kr-86/Kr-84 ratio. Measurements of terrestrial and extraterrestrial samples reproduce values from the literature. A compact instrument based upon the QITMS design would have a sensitivity high enough to reach the precision on isotope ratios (e.g. better than 1% for Xe-129,Xe-131-136/Xe-130 ratios) necessary for a scientific payload measuring noble gases collected in the Venus atmosphere.

New Horizons Geology Geophys	Washboard and fluted terrains on Pluto as evidence for ancient glaciation	NATURE ASTRONOMY			English	Article							SPUTNIK PLANITIA; BLADED TERRAIN; SURFACE; CHARON; REORIENTATION; TOPOGRAPHY	Distinctive landscapes termed 'washboard' and 'fluted' terrains(1,2), which border the N-2 ice plains of Sputnik Planitia along its northwest margin, are among the most enigmatic landforms yet seen on Pluto. These terrains consist of parallel to sub-parallel ridges that display a remarkably consistent east-northeast-west-southwest orientation-a configuration that does not readily point to a simple analogous terrestrial or planetary process or landform. Here, we report on mapping and analysis of their morphometry and distribution as a means to determine their origin. Based on their occurrence in generally low-elevation, low-relief settings adjacent to Sputnik Planitia that coincide with a major tectonic system, and through comparison with fields of sublimation pits seen in southern Sputnik Planitia, we conclude that washboard and fluted terrains represent crustal debris that were buoyant in pitted glacial N-2 ice that formerly covered this area, and which were deposited after the N-2 ice receded via sublimation. Crater surface age estimates indicate that this N-2 ice glaciation formed and disappeared early in Pluto's history, soon after formation of the Sputnik Planitia basin. These terrains constitute an entirely new category of glacial landform.	[White, Oliver L.; McKinnon, William B.; Beyer, Ross A.; Ore, Cristina M.

An array of magnetometer sensors is used to detect the position of the magnet, while a pair of box-shaped coils behind the display produces feedback forces on the stylus parallel to the plane of the display. Electromagnetic analysis for the system design is presented and system implementation is described. Validation results are given for force generation within a 100 mm x 100 mm area and force interaction with a virtual obstacle is demonstrated.

The Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS). II. On-the-fly Mosaicking Methodology	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: observational; surveys; techniques: interferometric		Telescope slew and settle time markedly reduce the efficiency of wide-field multi-epoch surveys for sensitive interferometers with small fields of view. The overheads can be mitigated through the use of on-the-fly mosaicking (OTFM), where the the antennas are driven at a non-sidereal rate and visibilities are recorded continuously. Here we introduce the OTFM technique for the Very Large Array (VLA), and describe its implementation for the Caltech-NRAO Stripe 82 Survey (CNSS), a dedicated five-epoch survey for slow transients at the S band (2-4 GHz). We also describe the OTFSim tool for planning dynamically scheduled OTFM observations on the VLA, the latest imaging capabilities for OTFM in CASA, and present a comparison of OTFM observations with pointed observations. Using the subset of our observations from the CNSS pilot and final surveys, we demonstrate that the wide-band and wide-field OTFM observations with the VLA can be imaged accurately, and that this technique offers a more efficient alternative to standard mosaicking for multi-epoch shallow surveys such as the CNSS and the VLA Sky Survey. We envisage that the new OTFM mode will facilitate new synoptic surveys and high-frequency mapping experiments on the VLA.	[Mooley, K. P.; Myers, S. T.; Frail, D.

Results of a systematic search for outburst events in 1.4 million galaxies	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: general; galaxies: active; galaxies: photometry; supernovae: general	OBSERVATORY SUPERNOVA SEARCH; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; TIDAL DISRUPTION; BLACK-HOLES; EMISSION; RATES; STAR; POPULATION	We present an analysis of 9 yr of Catalina Surveys optical photometry for 1.4 million spectroscopically confirmed SDSS galaxies. We find 717 outburst events that were not reported by ongoing transient surveys. These events have time-scales ranging from weeks to years. More than two-thirds of these new events are found in star-forming galaxies, while such galaxies only constitute similar to 20 per cent of our sample. Based on the properties of the hosts and events, we find that almost all of the new events are likely to be associated with regular supernovae. However, a small number of long time-scale events are found among the galaxies containing AGNs. These events have similar properties to those recently found in the analyses of light curves of large samples of AGNs. Given the lack of such events among more than a million passive galaxies in the sample, we suggest that the long outbursts are associated with supermassive black holes or their environments.

DES Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey Year 1 results: weak lensing mass calibration of redMaPPer galaxy clusters	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: weak; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmology: observations	COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; GIANTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; VARIANCE; PROFILES; IMPACT; MODEL; CODE; BIAS	We constrain the mass-richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitational lensing. We split clusters into 4 x 3 bins of richness lambda and redshift z for lambda >= 20 and 0.2 <= z <= 0.65 and measure the mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modelling the scaling relation as M-200m|lambda, M-0(lambda/40)(F)((1 + /1.35)(G), we constrain the normalization of the scaling relation at the 5.0 per cent level, finding M-0 = [3.081 +/- 0.075(stat) +/- 0.133(sys)] center dot 10(14) M-aS (TM) at lambda = 40 and = 0.35. The recovered richness scaling index is F = 1.356 +/- 0.051 (stat) +/- 0.008 (sys) and the redshift scaling index G = -0.30 +/- 0.30 (stat) +/- 0.06 (sys). These are the tightest measurements of the normalization and richness scaling index made to date from a weak lensing experiment. We use a semi-analytic covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak lensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentring, cluster member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modelling of the halo-mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We discuss prospects for reducing our systematic error budget, which dominates the uncertainty on M-0. Our result is in excellent agreement with, but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a tool for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST.

After correcting for redshift and Milky Way dust reddening and reevaluating the spectroscopic classifications for each SN, we construct mean spectra of the three major spectral subtypes (Types IIb, Ib, and Ic) binned by phase. We compare measures of line strengths and widths made from this sample to the results of previous efforts, confirming that OI lambda 7774 absorption is stronger and found at higher velocity in Type Ic SNe than in Types Ib or IIb SNe in the first similar to 30 days after peak brightness, though the widths of nebular emission lines are consistent across subtypes. We also highlight newly available observations for a few rare subpopulations of interest.	[Shivvers, Isaac; Filippenko, Alexei V.; Zheng, WeiKang; Clubb, Kelsey I.; Li, Weidong; Serduke, Franklin J.

Correlation function	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	SURVEY COSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; GALAXY REDSHIFT SURVEY; POWER-SPECTRUM; PERTURBATION-THEORY; ICE-COLA; ACCURATE; SPACE; PEAK; GENERATION	This paper is the first in a set that analyses the covariance matrices of clustering statistics obtained from several approximate methods for gravitational structure formation. We focus here on the covariance matrices of anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories: predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field deterministically (ICE-COLA, PEAK PATCH, and PINOCCHIO), methods that require a calibration with N-body simulations (PATCHY and HALOGEN), and simpler recipes based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution function (PDF) of density fluctuations (lognormal and Gaussian density fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover the mean parameter values inferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results within 5 per cent for our lower mass threshold and 10 per cent for our higher mass threshold. Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to 20 per cent depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with no single method clearly outperforming the others.

J	Ravi, V				Ravi, Vikram			The observed properties of fast radio bursts	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						scattering; methods: data analysis; catalogues; pulsars: general; radio continuum: general	INTERSTELLAR SCATTERING; PULSAR SURVEY; SCINTILLATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; ORIGIN	I present an empirical study of the properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs): gigahertz-frequency, dispersed pulses of extragalactic origin. I focus my investigation on a sample of 17 FRBs detected at the Parkes radio telescope with largely self-consistent instrumentation. Of this sample, six are temporally unresolved, eight exhibit evidence for scattering in inhomogeneous plasma, and five display potentially intrinsic temporal structure. The characteristic scattering time-scales at a frequency of 1 GHz range between 0.005 and 32 ms; moderate evidence exists for a relation between FRB scattering time-scales and dispersion measures. Additionally, I present constraints on the fluences of Parkes FRBs, accounting for their uncertain sky positions, and use the multiple-beam detection of FRB 010724 (the Lorimer burst) to measure its fluence to be 800 +/- 400 Jy ms. FRBs, including the repeating FRB 121102, appear to manifest with a plethora of characteristics, and it is uncertain at present whether they share a common class of progenitor object, or arise from a selection of independent progenitors.

In addition to quiescent observations for all sources, we also observed two of these sources (IGR J17451-3022 and XTE J1818-245) in outburst. We detect the quiescent counterpart for twelve out of fifteen sources, and for the remaining three we report limiting magnitudes. The magnitudes of the detected counterparts range between K-s = 17.59 and K-s = 22.29 mag. We provide (limits on) the absolute magnitudes and finding charts of all sources. Of these twelve detections in quiescence, seven represent the first quiescent reported values (for MAXI J1543-564, XTE J1726-476, IGR J17451-3022, XTE J1818-245, MAXI J1828-249, MAXI J1836-194, Swift J1910.2-0546) and two detections show fainter counterparts to XTE J1752-223 and XTE J2012+381 than previously reported. We used theoretical arguments and observed trends, for instance between the outburst and quiescent X-ray luminosity and orbital period P-orb to derive an expected trend between Delta K-s and P-orb of Delta K-s alpha log P-orb(0.565). Comparing this to observations we find a different behaviour. We discuss possible explanations for this result.	[Lopez, K. M.; Jonker, P. G.; Torres, M. A.

KROSS-SAMI: a direct IFS comparison of the Tully-Fisher relation across 8 Gyr since z approximate to 1	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: general; galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; galaxies: star formation	SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY KROSS; STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; MASS-SIZE RELATIONS; STELLAR MASS; GALAXY SURVEY; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; EAGLE SIMULATIONS; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; FORMATION RATES; DATA RELEASE	We construct Tully-Fisher relations (TFRs), from large samples of galaxies with spatially-resolved H alpha emission maps from the K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS) at z approximate to 1. We compare these to data from the Sydney-Australian-Astronomical-Observatory Multi-object Integral-Field Spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey at z approximate to 0. We stringently match the data quality of the latter to the former, and apply identical analysis methods and sub-sample selection criteria to both to conduct a direct comparison of the absolute K-band magnitude and stellar mass TFRs at z approximate to 1 and 0. We find that matching the quality of the SAMI data to that of KROSS results in TFRs that differ significantly in slope, zero-point and (sometimes) scatter in comparison to the corresponding original SAMI relations. These differences are in every case as large or larger than the differences between the KROSS z approximate to 1 and matched SAMI z approximate to 0 relations. Accounting for these differences, we compare the TFRs at z approximate to 1 and 0. For disk-like, star-forming galaxies we find no significant difference in the TFR zero-points between the two epochs. This suggests the growth of stellar mass and dark matter in these types of galaxies is intimately linked over this approximate to 8 Gyr period.	[Tiley, A. L.; Harrison, C. M.; Johnson, H.

Characteristics of organic matter on Ceres from VIR/Dawn high spatial resolution spectra	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						astrochemistry; techniques: imaging spectroscopy; minor planet: Ceres	AMINO-ACIDS; AMMONIATED PHYLLOSILICATES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; AQUEOUS ALTERATION; SOLID BITUMENS; EVOLUTION; SURFACE; ORIGIN; MURCHISON; HYDROCARBONS	Ceres is the largest object in the main belt and is a wet body with a complex geological and chemical history. Its surface is composed of opaque materials, phyllosilicates, ammoniated-bearing minerals, carbonates, water ice, and salts. Recently, aliphatic organics, whose origin is still uncertain, have also been detected on the Ceres surface by the imaging spectrometer Visible and Infrared Spectrometer (VIR) on board Dawn. Here, using VIR spectra, acquired with a high spatial resolution (< 100 m), we have analysed the organic-rich areas, their spectral characteristics, and the associated mineralogy. The new VIR spectra in the 3.2-3.6 mu m spectral range have been compared to organic standard compounds measured in the laboratory, to investigate more deeply the nature of the organic matter on Ceres. The mineralogy appears quite complex, and the organic matter is often associated with a larger amount of ammoniated phases and carbonates. The detailed spectral analysis, as well as the laboratory comparison, reveal the presence of a band at 2.99-3 mu m, likely associated with organic or inorganic NH-compounds (amine or salts), and the organic matter may be characterized by a rather low abundance of oxygen atoms. Spectral models of the organic material indicate that hundreds of meters-size areas can be very rich in aliphatic organics, with an estimated organic amount larger than the quantity normally found in CC meteorites. The mineralogical context and the retrieved amounts suggest that the aliphatic organic is likely a Ceres' endogenous product, and we formulate a hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the organic matter inside Ceres.

Our re-reduced, flux-calibrated X-SHOOTER spectra of CR7 reveal an HeII emission line in observations obtained along the major axis of Ly alpha emission with the best seeing conditions. He II is spatially offset by approximate to+ 0.8 arcsec from the peak of Ly alpha emission, and it is found towards clump B. Our WFC3 grism spectra detects the UV continuum of CR7' s clump A, yielding a power law with beta = -2.5(-0.7) (+ 0.6) and M-UV = -21.87(-0.20) (+ 0.25) . No significant variability is found for any of the UV clumps on their own, but there is tentative (approximate to 2.2 sigma) brightening of CR7 in F110W as a whole from 2012 to 2017. HST grism data fail to robustly detect rest-frame UV lines in any of the clumps, implying fluxes less than or similar to 2 x 10(-17) erg s(-1) cm(-2) (3 sigma). We perform CLOUDY modelling to constrain the metallicity and the ionizing nature of CR7. CR7 seems to be actively forming stars without any clear active galactic nucleus activity in clump A, consistent with a metallicity of similar to 0.05-0.2 Z(circle dot). Component C or an interclump component between B and C may host a high ionization source. Our results highlight the need for spatially resolved information to study the formation and assembly of early galaxies.

Dark Energy Survey Collaboration	Dark Energy Survey year 1 results: galaxy sample for BAO measurement	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						large-scale structure of Universe; cosmology: observations	BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; LUMINOUS RED GALAXIES; CHALLENGE LIGHTCONE SIMULATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; POWER-SPECTRUM; DEEP SURVEY; SCALE; COVARIANCE; MODEL; I.	We define and characterize a sample of 1.3million galaxies extracted from the first year of Dark Energy Survey data, optimized to measure baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the presence of significant redshift uncertainties. The sample is dominated by luminous red galaxies located at redshifts z greater than or similar to 0.6. We define the exact selection using colour and magnitude cuts that balance the need of high number densities and small photometric redshift uncertainties, using the corresponding forecasted BAO distance error as a figure-of-merit in the process. The typical photo z uncertainty varies from 2.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent (in units of 1+z) from z = 0.6 to 1, with number densities from 200 to 130 galaxies per deg(2) in tomographic bins of width Delta z = 0.1. Next, we summarize the validation of the photometric redshift estimation. We characterize and mitigate observational systematics including stellar contamination and show that the clustering on large scales is robust in front of those contaminants. We show that the clustering signal in the autocorrelations and cross-correlations is generally consistent with theoretical models, which serve as an additional test of the redshift distributions.

Image simulations for gravitational lensing with SKYLENS	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitational lensing: strong; galaxies: clusters: general; dark energy; dark matter	GALAXIES; PARAMETERS; CAMERA; STARS	We present the latest version of the ray-tracing simulation code SKYLENS, which can be used to develop image simulations that reproduce strong lensing observations by any mass distribution with a high level of realism. Improvements of the code with respect to previous versions include the implementation of the multilens plane formalism, the use of denoised source galaxies from the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field, and the simulation of substructures in lensed arcs and images, based on a morphological analysis of bright nearby galaxies. SKYLENS can simulate observations with virtually any telescope. We present examples of space- and ground-based observations of a galaxy cluster through the Wide Field Channel on the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Near-Infrared Camera of the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide Field Imager of the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the Hyper Suprime Camera of the Subaru telescope, and the Visible Imaging Channel of the Euclid space mission.

Goldstone Radar Observations of Horseshoe-orbiting Near-Earth Asteroid 2013 BS45, a Potential Mission Target	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						minor planets, asteroids: individual (2013 B545); techniques: radar astronomy	SURFACE; COMPANION; REVISION; REGOLITH; BOULDERS; TOUTATIS; SHAPE; SIZE	We report radar observations of near-Earth asteroid 2013 B545 obtained during the 2013 apparition. This object is in a resonant, Earth-like orbit, and it is a backup target for NASA's NEA Scout mission. 2013 B545 belongs to the Arjuna orbital domain, which currently has similar to 20 discovered representatives. These objects tend to be small and difficult to characterize, and 2013 B545 is only the third Aijuna object observed with radar to date. We observed 2013 B545 on three days at Goldstone (8560 MHz, 3.5 cm) between 2013 February 10 and 13. The closest approach occurred on February 12 at a distance of 0.0126 au. We obtained relatively weak echo power spectra and ranging data at resolutions up to 0.125 mu s (18.75 m px(-1)). The Doppler broadening of the echo power spectra strongly suggests an upper bound on the rotation period of 1.9 minutes. The radar data, in combination with an assumption that the asteroid's radar albedo is no higher than that of metallic NEA 1986 DA, constrain the equivalent diameter to 15 m <= D <= 38 m. The circular polarization ratio is 0.21 +/- 0.06, which implies a near-surface that is relatively smooth on decimeter spatial scales. We bounded the OC radar albedo to eta(OC) >= 0.09 and the optical albedo remains relatively unconstrained at 0.05 <= pv <= 0.35. The Yarkovsky acceleration has not been detected but, due to the object's rapid rotation, would be dominated by a seasonal component whose direction and magnitude depends on the currently unknown pole orientation and thermal inertia.

KMT-2016-BLG-1107: A New Hollywood-planet Close/Wide Degeneracy	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro	MICROLENSING EVENTS; PHOTOMETRY	We show that microlensing event KNIT-2016-BLG-1107 displays a new type of degeneracy between wide-binary and close-binary Hollywood events in which a giant-star source envelops the planetary caustic. The planetary anomaly takes the form of a smooth, two-day "bump" far out on the falling wing of the light curve, which can be interpreted either as the source completely enveloping a minor-image caustic due to a close companion with mass ratio q = 0.036, or partially enveloping a major-image caustic due to a wide companion with q = 0.004. The best estimates of the companion masses are both in the planetary regime (3.3(-1.8)(+3.5) M-jup and 0.090(-0.037)(+0.096) M-jup) but differ by an even larger factor than the mass ratios due to different inferred host masses. We show that the two solutions can be distinguished by high-resolution imaging at first light on next-generation ("30 m") telescopes. We provide analytic guidance to understand the conditions under which this new type of degeneracy can appear.

Ground-based Spectroscopy of the Exoplanet XO-2b Using a Systematic Wavelength Calibration	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: atmospheres; methods: analytical; methods: data analysis; methods: observational; planets and satellites: individual (XO-2b); techniques: spectroscopic	ATMOSPHERIC SURVEY DETECTION; HOT-JUPITER; TRANSMISSION SPECTRA; ATOMIC DATA; HD 189733B; SODIUM; NA; ASTROPHYSICS; ABSORPTION; SCATTERING	Exoplanets orbiting close to their host star are expected to support a large ionosphere, which extends to larger pressures than witnessed in our solar system. These ionospheres can be investigated with ground-based transit observations of the optical signatures of alkali metals, which are the source of the ions. However, most ground- based transit spectra do not systematically resolve the wings of the features and continuum, as needed to constrain the alkali abundances. Here we present new observations and analyses of optical transit spectra that cover the Na doublet in the atmosphere of the exoplanet XO-2b. To assess the consistency of our results, observations were obtained from two separate platforms: Gemini/GMOS and Mayall/KOSMOS. To mitigate the systematic errors, we chose XO-2, because it has a binary companion of the same brightness and stellar type, which provides an ideal reference star to model Earth's atmospheric effects. We find that interpretation of the data is highly sensitive to time-varying translations along the detector, which change according to wavelength and differ between the target and reference star. It was necessary to employ a time-dependent cross-correlation to align our wavelength bins and correct for atmospheric differential refraction. This approach allows us to resolve the wings of the Na line across five wavelength bins at a resolution of similar to 1.6 nm and limit the abundance of Na. We obtain consistent results from each telescope with an Na amplitude of 521 +/- 161 and 403 +/- 186 ppm for GMOS and KOSMOS, respectively. The results are analyzed with a radiative transfer model that includes the effects of ionization. The data are consistent with a clear atmosphere between similar to 1 and 100 mbar that establishes a lower limit on Na at 0.4(-0.3)(+2) ppm ([Na/H] = -0.64(-0.6)(+0.78)), consistent with solar. However, we cannot rule out the presence of clouds at similar to 10 mbar that allow for higher Na abundances, which would be consistent with the stellar metallicity measured for the host star ([Na/H] = 0.485 +/- 0.043)	[Pearson, Kyle A.; Griffith, Caitlin A.; Koskinen, Tommi T.] Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Pearson, Kyle A.] No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Francisco St, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Zellem, Robert T.; Roudier, Gael M.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA	Pearson, KA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Lunar & Planetary Lab, 1629 East Univ Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.; Pearson, KA (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Phys & Astron, San Francisco St, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.

Developmental effector gene regulation: Multiplexed strategies for functional analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Skeletogenic effector genes; Embryonic gene regulation; Recombineered BACs; Tag vectors	CELL-TYPE; SPECIFICATION; CONSTRUCTS; EXPRESSION; LOGIC; DIFFERENTIATION; LINEAGE; SPICULE; MATRIX; MITF	The staggering complexity of the genome controls for developmental processes is revealed through massively parallel cis-regulatory analysis using new methods of perturbation and readout. The choice of combinations of these new methods is tailored to the system, question and resources at hand. Our focus is on issues that include the necessity or sufficiency of given cis-regulatory modules, cis-regulatory function in the normal spatial genomic context, and easily accessible high throughput and multiplexed analysis methods. In the sea urchin embryonic model, recombineered BACs offer new opportunities for consecutive modes of cis-regulatory analyses that answer these requirements, as we here demonstrate on a diverse suite of previously unstudied sea urchin effector genes expressed in skeletogenic cells. Positively active cis-regulatory modules were located in single Nanostring experiments per BAC containing the gene of interest, by application of our previously reported "barcode" tag vectors of which > 100 can be analyzed at one time. Computational analysis of DNA sequences that drive expression, based on the known skeletogenic regulatory state, then permitted effective identification of functional target site clusters. Deletion of these sub-regions from the parent BACs revealed module necessity, as simultaneous tests of the same regions in short constructs revealed sufficiency. Predicted functional inputs were then confirmed by site mutations, all generated and tested in multiplex formats. There emerged the simple conclusion that each effector gene utilizes a small subset of inputs from the skeletogenic GRN. These inputs may function to only adjust expression levels or in some cases necessary for expression. Since we know the GRN architecture upstream of the effector genes, we could then conceptually isolate and compare the wiring of the effector gene driver sub-circuits and identify the inputs whose removal abolish expression.

The Polyhedral Specular Reflector: A Spectrum-Splitting Multijunction Design to Achieve Ultrahigh (> 50%) Solar Module Efficiencies	IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						Concentrating; dichroic filter; high efficiency; photovoltaics; spectrum splitting	CONVERSION EFFICIENCY; LIMITING EFFICIENCIES; PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULE; OPTIMIZATION; SUNLIGHT; CELLS	The most feasible pathway to record 50% efficiency photovoltaic devices is by utilizing many (>4) junctions to minimize thermalization and nonahsorption losses. Here we propose a spectrum-splitting design, the polyhedral specular reflector (PSR), that employs an optical architecture to divide and concentrate incident sunlight, allowing the incorporation of more junctions compared with traditional monolithic architectures. This paper describes the PSR design and indicates the requirements to achieve a 50% efficiency module by coupling robust cell, optical, and electrical simulations. We predict that a module comprised of the seven submits with an average external radiative efficiency of at least 3%, an optical architecture capable of a splitting efficiency of at least 88% and 300x concentration, small (<= 1 mu m) metallic fingers for subcell contact, and a state-of-the-art power conditioning system (>98% efficiency) can achieve a module efficiency of 50%, a record for both multijunction cells and modules. We also discuss the flexibility of the design and explore how adjusting the size and type of concentrators can still yield record module efficiencies (>40%).

F.; Low, Steven H.; Mei, Shengwei			Distributed Optimal Frequency Control Considering a Nonlinear Network-Preserving Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Frequency control; network-preserving model; distributed control; incremental output passivity	POWER NETWORKS; STABILITY; DESIGN	This paper addresses the distributed optimal frequency control of power systems considering a network-preserving model with nonlinear power flows and excitation voltage dynamics. Salient features of the proposed distributed control strategy are fourfold, first, nonlinearity is considered to cope with large disturbances, second, only a part of generators are controllable, third, no load measurement is required, fourth, communication connectivity is required only for the controllable generators. To this end, benefiting from the concept of "virtual load demand," we first design the distributed controller for the controllable generators by leveraging the primal-dual decomposition technique. We then propose a method to estimate the virtual load demand of each controllable generator based on local frequencies. We derive incremental passivity conditions for the uncontrollable generators. Finally, we prove that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and its equilibrium attains the optimal solution to the associated economic dispatch problem.

Sequential activation of methane by Ir+: An IRMPD and theoretical investigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						Methane activation; Infrared multiple photon dissociation; Iridium; Carbon-carbon coupling; Dehydrogenation; Reaction coordinate pathway	GUIDED-ION-BEAM; VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; INFRARED-SPECTRA; TRANSITION-METAL	The sequential activation of up to 4 CH4 molecules by Ir+ is investigated through a gas-phase infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) experiment and theoretical calculations. A molecular beam apparatus was used to generate Ir+ by laser ablation and expose it to controlled amounts of CH4. Product ions were irradiated with IR light from a free electron laser over the 500-1800 cm(-1) spectral range and photodissociation was monitored using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Experimental spectra were obtained for five distinct species: [Ir,3C,8 H](+), [Ir,3C,10 H](+), [Ir,4C,10 H](+), [Ir,4C,12 H](+), and [Ir,O,3C,12 H](+). To identify these species, B3LYP/def2-TZVPPD geometry optimizations were performed on a variety of possible structures, with computed IR spectra compared to the experimental IRMPD spectra. This has led to the following assignments: [Ir,3C,8 H](+) = IrCH2(CH3)(2)(+), [Ir,3C,10 H](+) = HIr(CH3)(3)(+), [Ir,4C,10 H](+) = Ir(CH3)(2)(C(2)H4)(+), [Ir,4C,12 H](+) = a mixture of HIr(CH3)(C2H4)(+)(CH4), HIr(CH3)(2)(C2H5)(+), Ir(CH3)(4)(+), and (H-2)Ir(CH3)(2)(C2H4)(+), and [Ir,O,3C,12 H](+) = (H2O)HIr(CH3)(3)(+). Notably, evidence for C-C coupling is observed upon reaction with a fourth methane. Mechanisms for the formation of the observed products were also explored computationally by examining the reaction coordinate pathways for the reactions of methane with HIrCH+, IrCH2+, Ir(CH3)(2)(+), HIrCH2(CH3)(+), HIr(CH3)(3)(+), and IrCH2(CH3)(2)(+).

Multiple Stages of Carbonation and Element Redistribution during Formation of Ultramafic-Hosted Magnesite in Neoproterozoic Ophiolites of the Arabian-Nubian Shield, Egypt	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY			English	Article							CENTRAL EASTERN DESERT; MARIANA FORE-ARC; PODIFORM CHROMITITES; CHROMIAN SPINEL; CR-SPINEL; PETROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS; TECTONOMAGMATIC EVOLUTION; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; PERIDOTITE XENOLITHS; CRUSTAL EVOLUTION	We present a study of the serpentinized peridotites of the Ghadir-Mohagar-Ambaut area, Egypt. They represent the mantle section of a dismembered ophiolite, tectonically emplaced over a volcanosedimentary succession of island arc assemblages. The serpentinites are variably metamorphosed from greenschist to lower-amphibolite facies, metasomatized, and altered, including development of talc-carbonate and quartz-carbonate rocks, especially along shear zones and fault planes. Nevertheless, some samples contain relics of primary chromian spinel, olivine, and pyroxenes. Relict textures and whole-rock compositions (Mg#[molar Mg/(Mg+Fe2+)]=0.92-0.93, with low Al2O3 and CaO contents) both suggest harzburgite protoliths. The high Mg# and Ni contents of relict olivine and the high Cr# (molar Cr/(Cr+Al)) of fresh chromian spinel cores indicate that the protoliths experienced high degrees of partial melt extraction (similar to 34%-39%), well beyond the limit for exhaustion of clinopyroxene from the residue and consistent with formation in a forearc suprasubduction zone environment. The serpentinized ultramafic rocks in the study area are divided into massive serpentinite, serpentinite-hosted magnesite masses, and magnesite-filled veins. The carbonation and formation of magnesite ores took place through two metasomatic stages; the first is represented by the magnesite masses and associated with deep-seated metasomatism and alteration during serpentinization, whereas the second, vein-forming stage postdates serpentinization and occurred during obduction of the ophiolite. The differences in chemical composition between massive serpentinite and serpentinite-hosted magnesite masses suggest leaching of some elements and enrichment of others during carbonation; MgO, Cr, and Ni are depleted, whereas Fe2O3, CaO, MnO, Nb, Ba, Cu, Pb, Sr, and Zn are enriched in the serpentinite-hosted magnesite masses, relative to the host massive serpentinite.

Yet, the microscopic world in which these molecules reside induces error patterns that are fundamentally different from their digital counterparts. Hence, to maintain reliability in reading and writing, new coding schemes must be developed. In a reading technique called shotgun sequencing, a long DNA string is read in a sliding window fashion, and a profile vector is produced. It was recently suggested by Kiah et al. that such a vector can represent the permutation which is induced by its entries, and hence a rank-modulation scheme arises. Although this interpretation suggests high error tolerance, it is unclear which permutations are feasible and how to produce a DNA string whose profile vector induces a given permutation. In this paper, by observing some necessary conditions, an upper bound for the number of feasible permutations is given. Furthermore, a technique for deciding the feasibility of a permutation is devised. By using insights from this technique, an algorithm for producing a considerable number of feasible permutations is given, which applies to any alphabet size and any window length.

More specifically, we are interested in realizing generator matrices, for the full-length cyclic versions of these codes, where all rows have the same weight and the difference in weight between any columns is at most one. The results presented in this paper translate to computationally balanced encoding schemes, which can be appealing in distributed storage applications. Indeed, the balancedness of these generator matrices guarantees that the computation effort exerted by any storage node is essentially the same. In general, the framework presented can accommodate various values for the required row weight. We emphasize the possibility of constructing sparsest and balanced generator matrices for Reed-Solomon codes, i.e., each row is a minimum distance codeword. The number of storage nodes contacted once a message symbol is updated decreases with the row weight, so sparse constructions are appealing in that context. Results of similar flavor are presented for cyclic Tamo-Barg codes. In particular, we show that for a code with minimum distance d and locality r, a construction in which every row is of weight d+r-1 is possible. The constructions presented are deterministic and operate over the codes' original underlying finite field. As a result, efficient decoding from both errors and erasures is possible thanks to the plethora of efficient decoders available for the codes considered.

Membrane-separated electrochemical latrine wastewater treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							REVERSE-OSMOSIS CONCENTRATE; TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS; RECOVERY; OXIDATION; GENERATION; AMMONIA; ION; CONDUCTIVITY; DEGRADATION; NUTRIENTS	Electrolysis is demonstrated to be useful for onsite latrine wastewater treatment. Improved wastewater treatment efficiencies are achieved through the use of a combination of cation and anion exchange membranes (CEM/AEM) in electrochemical reactors. Compared to a membrane-free electrolysis cell, the separation of anodic and cathodic chambers using a CEM separator is shown to reduce energy consumption by 51% for COD removal and 87% for NH4+ removal. Furthermore, 51% of the initial [NH4+](0) is recovered via electrodialysis. CEM-separated electrolysis is shown to produce 39% less ClO3- and 92% less chlorinated organic by-products than in a membrane-free reactor. Helminth (Ascaris suum) eggs, which yield parasitic worms, are very resistant to conventional disinfection methods. Membrane-free electrolysis only inactivates 15% of the dosed helminth eggs (100 eggs per mL). In CEM-separated electrolysis, a combination of low pH and in situ chlorine production in the anodic chamber results in 85% inactivation of helminth eggs. In addition, H-2, which is produced in the cathodic chamber of the CEM-separated reactor, is directly converted to electricity using a hydrogen-air fuel cell. The hydrogen energy produced during electrolysis is estimated to reduce the overall energy cost of operation by 20%. Recovery of 85% of the initial [PO43-](0) and pH neutralization are achieved by treating the acidic effluent of a CEM-separated electrolysis cell in an AEM-separated electrolysis cell. A one-month continuous operation demonstrates the potential of using both the CEM and AEM during electrolysis to achieve more efficient wastewater treatment while, at the same time, recovering NH4+ and PO43-, for eventual use as agricultural fertilizers.

Our analyses suggest that gene gain and loss in Aurelia is comparable to what has been found in its morphologically simpler relatives-the anthozoan corals and sea anemones. RNA sequencing analysis does not support the hypothesis that taxonomically restricted (orphan) genes play an oversized role in the development of the medusa stage. Instead, genes broadly conserved across animals and eukaryotes play comparable roles throughout the life cycle. All life stages of Aurelia are significantly enriched in the expression of genes that are hypothesized to interact in protein networks found in bilaterian animals. Collectively, our results suggest that increased life cycle complexity in Aurelia does not correlate with an increased number of genes. This leads to two possible evolutionary scenarios: either medusozoans evolved their complex medusa life stage (with concomitant shifts into new ecological niches) primarily by re-working genetic pathways already present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians, or the earliest cnidarians had a medusa life stage, which was subsequently lost in the anthozoans. While we favour the earlier hypothesis, the latter is consistent with growing evidence that many of the earliest animals were more physically complex than previously hypothesized.

Yet, the associated changes in ice flow that lead to mass redistribution and modify the glacier sensitivity to climate are poorly constrained. Here we present observations of changes in ice flow for all glaciers in High Mountain Asia over the period 2000-2017, based on one million pairs of optical satellite images. Trend analysis reveals that in 9 of the 11 surveyed regions, glaciers show sustained slowdown concomitant with ice thinning. In contrast, the stable or thickening glaciers of the Karakoram and West Kunlun regions experience slightly accelerated glacier flow. Up to 94% of the variability in velocity change between regions can be explained by changes in gravitational driving stress, which in turn is largely controlled by changes in ice thickness. We conclude that, despite the complexities of individual glacier behaviour, decadal and regional changes in ice flow are largely insensitive to changes in conditions at the bed of the glacier and can be well estimated from ice thickness change and slope alone.

Their structural attributes vary considerably across spatial scales, yielding large uncertainties in regional and global estimates of carbon stocks. Here, we present a global analysis of mangrove canopy height gradients and aboveground carbon stocks based on remotely sensed measurements and field data. Our study highlights that precipitation, temperature and cyclone frequency explain 74% of the global trends in maximum canopy height, with other geophysical factors influencing the observed variability at local and regional scales. We find the tallest mangrove forests in Gabon, equatorial Africa, where stands attain 62.8 m. The total global mangrove carbon stock (above- and belowground biomass, and soil) is estimated at 5.03 Pg, with a quarter of this value stored in Indonesia. Our analysis implies sensitivity of mangrove structure to climate change, and offers a baseline to monitor national and regional trends in mangrove carbon stocks.

Complementary numerical modeling of centrifuge experiments	SOIL DYNAMICS AND EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Topography; Finite elements; Centrifuge experiments; Boundary effects; Amplification	GROUND-MOTION; SEISMIC RESPONSE; WAVE-PROPAGATION; EARTHQUAKE; HILL; DIFFRACTION; TARZANA; EXAMPLE; FIELD	Topographic effects, the modification of seismic shaking by irregular topographies compared to flat ground, have been extensively studied. Very few studies, however, have investigated the effects of the stratigraphy and nonlinear response of the underlying geology on topographic amplification. Furthermore, most experimental studies have been performed in the field, where it is often difficult to establish an ideal flat-ground reference station, as well as to characterize the soil properties and their spatial variability in sufficient detail. Dafni [1] recently tested the seismic response of step-like slopes in a series of centrifuge experiments, where the incident motion, reference station and material properties were characterized in detail. In this study, we investigated the influence of the container boundary on topographic effects observed in the centrifuge experiments by performing numerical simulations with and without the container boundary. Our analysis suggested that the rigid-body rocking motion of the centrifuge container likely increased the experimental topographic spectral ratios, contributing to the discrepancy between the simulated and observed spectral ratios. We also found that although the laminar box lateral boundaries caused spurious reflections, they didn't qualitatively affect the ground surface amplification pattern compared to numerical predictions of the same configuration without boundaries. At the same time, and most importantly, however, we found that the baseplate by trapping waves scattered and diffracted by the slope amplified the ground motion at the crest up to one order of magnitude compared to numerical predictions of the response in absence of the baseplate. Our results show that topographic effects can be significantly affected by the underlying soil stratigraphy, and allude to the potentially significant role of this phenomenon in elevating seismic risk in regions with strong topographic relief. The findings of this study also suggest that future studies will benefit from clear understanding and careful considerations of capabilities and limitations of different investigation methods and that the numerical modeling and the lab testing (or the field testing) methods should complement each other.

Interface engineering for light-driven water oxidation: unravelling the passivating and catalytic mechanism in BiVO4 overlayers	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS			English	Article							SURFACE RECOMBINATION; BISMUTH VANADATE; PHOTOANODES; PHOTOCURRENT; DISCOVERY; LAYER	Artificial photosynthetic approaches require the combination of light absorbers interfaced with overlayers that enhance charge transport and collection to perform catalytic reactions. Despite numerous efforts that have coupled various catalysts to light absorbing semiconductors, the optimization of semiconductor/catalyst as well as catalyst/electrolyte interfaces and the identification of the role of the catalyst still remain a key challenge. Herein, we assemble (NiFeCoCe)O-x multi-component overlayers, interfaced with bismuth vanadate photoanodes, and determine the roles of different elements on promoting interfacial charge transfer and catalytic reaction over competitive photocarrier recombination loss processes. Through this understanding, and aided by complementary macroscopic photoelectrochemical measurements and nanoscale atomic force microscopy techniques, a bifunctional (CoFeCe/NiFe)O-x overlayer was rationally engineered. The resulting multi-functional coating yields BiVO4 photoanodes with almost 100% efficient surface collection of holes under oxygen evolving reaction conditions. The (CoFeCe)O-x component excels at efficient capture and transport of photogenerated holes in BiVO4 through the availability of redox active states, whereas (NiFe)O-x plays a vital role in reducing charge recombination at the BiVO4/electrolyte interface. In addition, this study supports the hypothesis that catalytic sites act as electronically active trap states on uncoated BiVO4 photoanodes.

To prevent cell obliteration, oxygen supply is critical after transplantation, especially until the graft is sufficiently re-vascularized. To supply oxygen during this period, we developed a chemical-/electrical-free implantable oxygen transporter that delivers oxygen to the hypoxic graft site from ambient air by diffusion potential. This device is simply structured using a biocompatible silicone-based body that holds islets, connected to a tube that opens outside the body. In computational simulations, the oxygen transporter increased the oxygen level to > 120 mmHg with in grafts; in contrast, a control device that did not transport oxygen showed <6.5 mmHg. In vitro experiments demonstrated similar results. To test the effectiveness of the oxygen transporter in vivo, we transplanted pancreatic islets, which are susceptible to hypoxia, subcutaneously into diabetic rats. Islets transplanted using the oxygen transporter showed improved graft viability and cellular function over the control device. These results indicate that our oxygen transporter, which is safe and easily fabricated, effectively supplies oxygen locally. Such a device would be suitable for multiple clinical applications, including cell transplantations that require changing a hypoxic microenvironment into an oxygen-rich site.

J	Martin, N; Gharib, M				Martin, Nathan; Gharib, Morteza			Experimental trajectory optimization of a flapping fin propulsor using an evolutionary strategy	BIOINSPIRATION & BIOMIMETICS			English	Article						flapping propulsion; autonomous underwater vehicle; bio-inspired propulsion; trajectory optimization; spherical parallel manipulator; trajectory generator; covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy	GAIT TRANSITION; WAKE STRUCTURE; KINEMATICS; LOCOMOTION; THRUST; FISHES; ADAPTATION; MECHANICS; DESIGN; FLIGHT	The experimental optimization of bio-inspired flapping fin trajectories are demonstrated for potential applications as a side or a rear propulsor of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The trajectories are scored based upon their difference from a force set-point and upon their efficiency and are parameterized by 10 variables inspired by fish swimming. The flapping fin is a generic rectangular rigid flat plate with a tapered edge. Optimization occurs as follows. First, a generation of trajectories is created. Second, the trajectories are executed by a spherical parallel manipulator, during which the forces are acquired. Third, the trajectories are scored and a new generation of trajectories is created using the covariance matrix adaptive evolutionary strategy. This loop repeats ad-infinitum until the search converges. Within the first set of searches, two trajectories for optimal side-force generation are found, one is fully three-dimensional while the other is artificially constrained to a line, and one trajectory for optimal thrust generation is found. All searches demonstrate good convergence properties and match the desired force set-point almost immediately. Additional generations primarily improve the efficiency of the maneuver. The two trajectories for generating side-force have a similar efficiency, which shows potential in utilizing a simple trajectory limited to a line. Comparison between the trajectories for generating side-force and thrust suggests that side-force generation is more efficient around Re , similar to 1000, based on the average tip velocity and length of the fin. The second set of searches explores the behavior of the optimal trajectories for generating side-force at a lower force set-point and the third set of searches explores the sensitivity and repeatability of the optimization.

Emulation of environmental models using polynomial chaos expansion	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Model emulation; Surrogate modeling; Polynomial chaos expansion; Sensitivity analysis	PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; STOCHASTIC COLLOCATION METHOD; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; REGRESSION METAMODEL; DATA ASSIMILATION; PART I; SIMULATION; UNCERTAINTY; DYNAMICS	This paper investigates the applicability of model emulation to speed up simulation time of CPU intensive environmental models. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) emulators are constructed for three case studies of increasing complexity. The level of emulator training and the order of polynomial necessary to sufficiently build accurate emulators for each model are investigated. Although the PCE emulators shown here do not approximate well the outputs of parameter rich models (80 + parameters), results demonstrate that the emulators mimic closely outputs of relatively simple, low dimensional, simulation models (15 parameters or less).

Effect of iron limitation on the isotopic composition of cellular and released fixed nitrogen in Azotobacter vinelandii	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Nitrogen isotopes; Nitrogen fixation; Alternative nitrogenase; Iron; Kinetic isotope effect; Siderophore; Azotobacter vinelandii	DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN; N-2 FIXATION; AMINO-ACIDS; ANABAENA-VARIABILIS; AMMONIA EXCRETION; FOOD-WEB; MARINE; SIDEROPHORES; FRACTIONATION; TRICHODESMIUM	Most biological nitrogen transformations have characteristic kinetic isotope effects used to track these processes in modern and past environments. The isotopic fractionation associated with nitrogen fixation, the only biological source of fixed nitrogen (N), provides a particularly important constraint for studies of nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen fixation using the 'canonical' Mo-nitrogenase produces biomass with a delta N-15 value of ca. -1 parts per thousand (vs. atmospheric N-2). If the 'alternative' V-and Fe-only nitrogenases are used, biomass delta N-15 can be between -6 parts per thousand and -7 parts per thousand. These biomass values are assumed to be relatively invariant and to reflect the cellular level expressed isotope effect of nitrogen fixation. However, field and laboratory studies report wide ranges of diazotrophic biomass delta N-15 (from -3.6 parts per thousand to +0.5 parts per thousand for Mo-based nitrogen fixation). This variation could be partly explained by the release of dissolved organic N (DON) that is isotopically distinct from biomass. The model nitrogen fixer Azotobacter vinelandii secretes siderophores, small molecules that aid in Fe uptake and can comprise >30% of fixed nitrogen. To test whether siderophores (and other released N) can decouple biomass delta N-15 from the isotope effect of nitrogen fixation we measured the isotopic composition of biomass and released N in Fe-limited A. vinelandii cultures fixing nitrogen with Mo-and V-nitrogenases. We report that biomass delta N-15 was elevated under Fe limitation with a maximum value of +1.2 parts per thousand for Mo-based nitrogen fixation. Regardless of the nitrogenase isozyme used, released nitrogen delta N-15 was also 2-3 parts per thousand lower than biomass delta N-15. Siderophore nitrogen was found to have a slightly higher delta N-15 than the rest of the DON pool but was still produced in large enough concentrations to account for increases in biomass delta N-15. The low delta N-15 of siderophores (relative to biomass) is consistent with what is known from compound specific isotope studies of the amino acids used in siderophore biosynthesis, and indicates that other amino-acid derived siderophores should also have a low delta N-15. The implications for studies of nitrogen fixation are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[McRose, D. L.; Kopf, S. H.; Baars, O.; Sigman, D. M.; Morel, F. M.

Extreme C-13-depletions and organic sulfur content argue for S-fueled anaerobic methane oxidation in 2.72 Ga old stromatolites	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Early life; SIMS; Carbon isotopes; Organic matter; Stromatolites; Sulfurization; Tumbiana formation; Methanotrophy	CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION; MASS-INDEPENDENT FRACTIONATION; MICROBIAL SULFATE REDUCTION; AEROBIC NITROGEN-CYCLE; FORTESCUE GROUP; PILBARA-CRATON; ACETOCLASTIC METHANOGENESIS; OXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS; NITRATE REDUCTION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA	The extreme C-13-depletions recorded in Neoarchean organic matter (OM) have commonly been interpreted as markers of methanotrophy. This methane oxidation metabolism could have been performed using oxidants such as dioxygen, sulfate, nitrite/nitrate, and/or Fe3+- and Mn4+- minerals. Acetogenesis using acetyl-CoA metabolism may produce similar C-13-depletions. We investigated delta C-13 and S/C values of OM in 2.72 Ga old lacustrine stromatolites of the Tumbiana Formation (Australia) using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), coupled with X-ray spectroscopy. Type-A OM is embedded in quartz and/or chlorite. We show that mixtures of chlorite bias negatively the delta C-13(org) of associated OM measured by SIMS, likely through recombination of hydrogen from chlorite with carbon from OM during analysis. Type-A OM, associated with quartz or interleaved with chlorites (but remote enough to avoid H-recombination), displays delta C-13(org) between -56.1 and -50.6% VPDB (mean: 53.5%, SD +/- 1.8%). The intimate association of Type-A OM with Fe-rich chlorite and its main occurrence in pyritic layers coupled with C-13-depletions is most parsimoniously interpreted as anaerobic methanotrophy using Fe3+- minerals and/or oxidized S. Type-B OM comprises <2-mu m organic globules embedded in calcite. A mass balance correction using the delta C-13 values measured on Type-B globules mixed with calcite and those measured on pure calcite yielded corrected delta C-13*(org) values for the globules ranging between -65.2 and -52.5% (mean -58.8%, SD +/- 3.6%). In a context where Fe and S reduction could outcompete acetogenesis for a fraction of any available H-2, these extremely low delta C-13(org) values are difficult to explain with chemoautotrophic acetogenesis. Atomic S/C ratios in Type-B globules reach up to 0.042, i.e. up to tenfold the values (0.003-0.004) in Type A-OM. These organic S concentrations, combined with the extremely low delta C-13*(org) values, support anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to sulfur oxidation. Finally, Type-C OM, interpreted as migrated pyrobitumen nodules, displays delta C-13(org) of -48 to -39.1%. The most extreme low-delta C-13(org) values of the Precambrian are thus best interpreted as the result of lacustrine methanotrophy fueled by oxidized S and/or Fe species, which likely derived from oxygenic and/or anoxygenic photosynthesis. Photosynthesis, followed by methanogenesis and methanotrophy may have been important in lakes at a time of supercontinent growth and eruption of large subaerial igneous provinces. In this context, anaerobic methanotrophy could have played a part in regulating atmospheric methane. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, B; Hajimiri, A				Hong, Brian; Hajimiri, Ali			A Phasor-Based Analysis of Sinusoidal Injection Locking in LC and Ring Oscillators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS			English	Article						Adler's equation; injection locking; injection pulling; LC oscillator; lock range; nonlinear circuit; oscillator; phasor; ring oscillator; sinusoidal steady state	DESIGN ISSUES; RANGE	A new perspective into the locking behavior of LC and ring oscillators is presented. By decomposing a sinusoidal injection current into in-phase and quadrature-phase components, exact expressions for the amplitude and phase of an injection-locked LC oscillator which hold for any injection strength and frequency are derived and confirmed by simulation. The analysis, which can be naturally extended to an arbitrary LC resonator topology, leads to a rigorous understanding of the fundamental physics underlying the locking phenomenon. Furthermore, an investigation of the different necessary and sufficient conditions for injection locking to occur is carried out, leading to a more precise notion of the lock range. The ring oscillator is also analyzed in an analogous fashion, resulting in simple yet accurate closed-form expressions for the fractional lock range in the small-injection and long-ring regimes; the expressions are validated by simulations of single-ended inverter-based ring oscillators in 65-nm CMOS. The mathematics behind how the injection modifies the phase delay contributed by each stage in the ring is discussed. A corollary that generalizes the small-injection lock range to any feedback-based oscillator topology is established. Conceptual and analytical connections to the existing literature are reviewed.

Mapping Color to Meaning in Colormap Data Visualizations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Visual Reasoning; Visual Communication; Colormaps; Color Perception; Visual Encoding; Visual Design	PERCEPTION; MAPS	To interpret data visualizations, people must determine how visual features map onto concepts. For example, to interpret colormaps, people must determine how dimensions of color (e.g., lightness, hue) map onto quantities of a given measure (e.g., brain activity, correlation magnitude). This process is easier when the encoded mappings in the visualization match people's predictions of how visual features will map onto concepts, their inferred mappings. To harness this principle in visualization design, it is necessary to understand what factors determine people's inferred mappings. In this study, we investigated how inferred color-quantity mappings for colormap data visualizations were influenced by the background color. Prior literature presents seemingly conflicting accounts of how the background color affects inferred color-quantity mappings. The present results help resolve those conflicts, demonstrating that sometimes the background has an effect and sometimes it does not, depending on whether the colormap appears to vary in opacity. When there is no apparent variation in opacity, participants infer that darker colors map to larger quantities (dark-is-more bias). As apparent variation in opacity increases, participants become biased toward inferring that more opaque colors map to larger quantities (opaque-is-more bias). These biases work together on light backgrounds and conflict on dark backgrounds. Under such conflicts, the opaque-is-more bias can negate. or even supersede the dark-is-more bias. The results suggest that if a design goal is to produce colormaps that match people's inferred mappings and are robust to changes in background color, it is beneficial to use colormaps that will not appear to vary in opacity on any background color, and to encode larger quantities in darker colors.

Design and performance evaluation of LTP enhancements for lossy space channels	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						delay-/disruption-tolerant networking; interplanetary networking; Licklider Transmission Protocol; performance evaluation; space communications	TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL LTP; TOLERANT NETWORKING; DTN	This paper deals with the performance of Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) in space environment, focusing on the impact of segment losses and the design of possible improvements. The in-depth analysis of retransmission mechanisms carried out in the paper shows that, while LTP already achieves delivery time performance very close to the theoretical optimum in ideal conditions (no losses) and when losses affect data segments, a substantial improvement is still possible concerning signaling segments, whose loss can result in a significant increase of the LTP block delivery time. To this end, 2 simple enhancements, the Closing State and the proactive retransmission of signaling segments, are proposed and evaluated in the paper. Both enhancements have been added as optional features to the original Interplanetary Overlay Network LTP implementation (ION 3.5.0), in order to evaluate their effectiveness on a GNU/Linux testbed running the full protocol stack. Results presented in the paper confirm the validity of the proposed enhancements, as they significantly reduce the average delivery time in the presence of high losses and provide the additional advantage, even when losses are relatively low, of largely reducing the difference between average and worst cases.

Black carbon aggregates: A database for optical properties	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Black carbon; Fractal aggregate; Optical properties	RADIATIVE PROPERTIES; SCATTERING PROPERTIES; LIGHT-SCATTERING; T-MATRIX; SOOT; ABSORPTION; PARTICLES; MORPHOLOGY; AEROSOLS; EXPONENT	Black carbon (BC) aerosol plays an important role in the atmosphere as an absorber of solar radiation and contributes significantly to global warming. The optical properties of BC are fundamental for both direct radiative effect studies and remote sensing of BC properties. However, due to the complex aggregation structures of BC particles, accurate simulations of their optical properties are limited and computationally expensive, while equivalent spherical models or approximate methods could easily introduce relative errors up to 30%. This study generates a comprehensive database to calculate aggregate optical properties efficiently and accurately. The database covers a wide range of BC properties including aggregation structure, refractive index, and particle size (both monomer size and number of monomers). An accurate numerical model, i.e. the multiple-sphere T-matrix method, is used to calculate the single-scattering properties of BC clusters in the form of fractal aggregates. By interpolation, the database can be used to give the scattering properties of aggregates with monomer number from 1 up to 3000, monomer size parameter from 0.05 to 0.5, real part of refractive index from 1.2 to 2.0, and imaginary part from 0.2 to 1.0. The relative errors caused by the interpolation are much less than 1% for the single scattering properties. The pre-calculated database and the implementation used to calculate the required aggregate optical properties are publicly available for users interested in remote sensing of BC aerosols and performing radiative effect calculations.

Inversion symmetry, however, rules out the second-order nonlinear electric-dipole response(1,4,5) in materials widely adopted in integrated photonics (for example, SiO2, Si and Si3N4). Here, we report nonlinear optics induced by symmetry breaking(6-10) at the surface of an ultrahigh-Q silica microcavity under a sub-milliwatt continuous-wave pump. By dynamically coordinating the double-resonance phase matching, a second harmonic is achieved with an unprecedented conversion efficiency of 0.049% W-1, 14 orders of magnitude higher than that of the non-enhancement case(11). In addition, the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic symmetry breaking at the surface(8,12) can be identified unambiguously, with guided control of the pump polarization and the recognition of the second-harmonic mode distribution. This work not only extends the emission frequency range of silica photonic devices, but also lays the groundwork for applications in ultra-sensitive surface analysis.

Importantly, the RV technique provides information about the exoplanet mass, which is unavailable with the complementary technique of transit photometry. However, RV detection of an Earth-like planet in the 'habitable zone'(1) requires extreme spectroscopic precision that is only possible using a laser frequency comb (LFC)(2). Conventional LFCs require complex filtering steps to be compatible with astronomical spectro-graphs, but a new chip-based microresonator device, the Kerr soliton microcomb(3-8), is an ideal match for astronomical spectrograph resolution and can eliminate these filtering steps. Here, we demonstrate an atomic/molecular line-referenced soliton microcomb for calibration of astronomical spectro-graphs. These devices can ultimately provide LFC systems that would occupy only a few cubic centimetres(9,10), thereby greatly expanding implementation of these technologies into remote and mobile environments beyond the research lab.

The equivalence principle at work in radiation from unaccelerated atoms and mirrors	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						Unruh radiation; mirror; equivalence principle; acceleration	ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR; SPACE; FIELD; SCHWARZSCHILD; PARTICLE; VACUUM; CREATION	The equivalence principle is a perennial subject of controversy, especially in connection with radiation by a uniformly accelerated classical charge, or a freely falling charge observed by a supported detector. Recently, related issues have been raised in connection with the Unruh radiation associated with accelerated detectors (including two-level atoms and resonant cavities). A third type of system, very easy to analyze because of conformal invariance, is a two-dimensional scalar field interacting with perfectly reflecting boundaries (mirrors). After reviewing the issues for atoms and cavities, we investigate a stationary mirror from the point of view of an accelerated detector in 'Rindler space'. In keeping with the conclusions of earlier authors about the electromagnetic problem, we find that a radiative effect is indeed observed; from an inertial point of view, the process arises from a collision of the negative vacuum energy of Rindler space with the mirror. There is a qualitative symmetry under interchange of accelerated and inertial subsystems (a vindication of the equivalence principle), but it hinges on the accelerated detector's being initially in its own 'Rindler vacuum'. This observation is consistent with the recent work on the Unruh problem.	[Fulling, S. A.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Math, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Fulling, S.

This project was stimulated and facilitated by intensive discussions among SAF and the research group of Marlan Scully at IQSE-TAMU, the research group of George Matsas in Brazil, and Don Page and Bill Unruh. IQSE funding aided JHW to attend a workshop in College Station in October, 2017, and SAF to attend the PQE conference in Snowbird in January, 2018. Dr. Unruh observed that the initial burst at u = -2/a is physically understandable as specular reflection of the incoming Rindler vacuum flux at v = 0. Dr Page made helpful comments on the manuscript.		31	7	7	0	7	IOP PUBLISHING LTD	BRISTOL	TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND	0031-8949	1402-4896		PHYS SCRIPTA	Phys. Scr.

A custom-built wide-field camera provides a 47 deg(2) field of view and 8 s readout time, yielding more than an order of magnitude improvement in survey speed relative to its predecessor survey, the Palomar Transient Factory. We describe the design and implementation of the camera and observing system. The ZTF data system at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center provides near-real-time reduction to identify moving and varying objects. We outline the analysis pipelines, data products, and associated archive. Finally, we present on-sky performance analysis and first scientific results from commissioning and the early survey. ZTF's public alert stream will serve as a useful precursor for that of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.	[Bellm, Eric C.; Bolin, Bryce; Connolly, Andrew; Eadie, Gwendolyn; Golkhou, V.

The Zwicky Transient Facility: Data Processing, Products, and Archive	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						astronomical databases: miscellaneous; catalogs; methods: data analysis; techniques: image processing; techniques: photometric	PHOTOMETRY	The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of similar to 3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g similar to 20.8 and r similar to 20.6 mag (AB, 5 sigma in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The real-time pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point-source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. We present some preliminary results of the calibration performance delivered by the real-time pipeline. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia DR1 is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per-axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N >= 10 and hence corresponds to the typical astrometric uncertainty down to this limit. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. The high end of these ranges corresponds to an airmass approaching similar to 2-the limit of the public survey. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae; rare flux transients; variable stars; eclipsing binaries; variability from active galactic nuclei;counterparts to gravitational wave sources; a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae; and solar-system objects.

We describe the ZTF alert stream distribution and processing (filtering) system. The system uses existing open-source technologies developed in industry: Kafka, a real-time streaming platform, and Avro, a binary serialization format. The technologies used in this system provide a number of advantages for the ZTF use case, including (1) built-in replication, scalability, and stream rewind for the distribution mechanism; (2) structured messages with strictly enforced schemas and dynamic typing for fast parsing; and (3) a Python-based stream processing interface that is similar to batch for a familiar and user-friendly plug-in filter system, all in a modular, primarily containerized system. The production deployment has successfully supported streaming up to 1.2 million alerts or roughly 70 GB of data per night, with each alert available to a consumer within about 10 s of alert candidate production. Data transfer rates of about 80,000 alerts/minute have been observed. In this paper, we discuss this alert distribution and processing system, the design motivations for the technology choices for the framework, performance in production, and how this system may be generally suitable for other alert stream use cases, including the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

What Does a Successful Postdoctoral Fellowship Publication Record Look Like?	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						sociology of astronomy	CITATIONS	Obtaining a prize postdoctoral fellowship in astronomy and astrophysics involves a number of factors, many of which cannot be quantified. One criterion that can be measured is the publication record of an applicant. The publication records of past fellowship recipients may, therefore, provide some quantitative guidance for future prospective applicants. We investigated the publication patterns of recipients of the NASA prize postdoctoral fellowships in the Hubble, Einstein, and Sagan programs from 2014 through 2017, using the NASA ADS reference system. We tabulated their publications at the point where fellowship applications were submitted, and we find that the 133 fellowship recipients in that time frame had a median of 6 +/- 2 first-author publications, and 14 +/- 6 co-authored publications. The full range of first-author papers is one to 15, and for all papers ranges from two to 76, indicating very diverse publication patterns. Thus, while fellowship recipients generally have strong publication records, the distribution of both first-author and co-authored papers is quite broad; there is no apparent threshold of publications necessary to obtain these fellowships. We also examined the post-PhD publication rates for each of the three fellowship programs, between male and female recipients, across the four years of the analysis and find no consistent trends. We hope that these findings will prove a useful reference to future junior scientists.

Carnegie Supernova Project-II: Extending the Near-infrared Hubble Diagram for Type Ia Supernovae to z similar to 0.1	PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC			English	Article						cosmology: observations; galaxies: distances and redshifts; (stars:) supernovae: general Online material: color figures	K CORRECTIONS; DATA RELEASE; REDSHIFT; PHOTOMETRY; SEARCH; SPECTROSCOPY; MAGNITUDES; LUMINOSITY; TELESCOPE; SN-1991T	The Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II) was an NSF-funded, four-year program to obtain optical and near-infrared observations of a "Cosmology" sample of similar to 100 Type. Ia supernovae located in the smooth Hubble flow (0.03 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 0.10). Light curves were also obtained of a "Physics" sample composed of 90 nearby Type. Ia supernovae at z <= 0.04 selected for near-infrared spectroscopic timeseries observations. The primary emphasis of the CSP-II is to use the combination of optical and near-infrared photometry to achieve a distance precision of better than 5%. In this paper, details of the supernova sample, the observational strategy, and the characteristics of the photometric data are provided. In a companion paper, the near-infrared spectroscopy component of the project is presented.	[Phillips, M. M.; Contreras, Carlos; Hsiao, E.

An approach to the verification of quantum computation within the framework of interactive proofs has been fruitful for addressing this problem. Specifically, an untrusted agent (prover) alleging to perform quantum computations can have his claims verified by another agent (verifier) who only has access to classical computation and a small quantum device for preparing or measuring single qubits. However, when this quantum device is prone to errors, verification becomes challenging and often existing protocols address this by adding extra assumptions, such as requiring the noise in the device to be uncorrelated with the noise on the prover's devices. In this paper, we present a simple protocol for verifying quantum computations, in the presence of noisy devices, with no extra assumptions. This protocol is based on post hoc techniques for verification, which allow for the prover to know the desired quantum computation and its input. We also perform a simulation of the protocol, for a one-qubit computation, and find the error thresholds when using the qubit repetition code as well as the Steane code.

Today, islands within the Delta have subsided to the point where most lie below mean sea level. Long-term sustainability of the Delta requires reversal of subsidence, but spatially comprehensive maps of subsidence have not been available to inform and monitor remediation. Reported here is the first spatially dense map of recent subsidence rates across the Delta, based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry and constrained by GNSS observations. The analysis uses a temporally dense and spatially overlapping set of data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) sensor in 2009-2015. On average, the Delta is subsiding by 9.2 +/- 4.4 mm/yr with high variability even at the sub-island scale, including peak subsidence of 160 +/- 4.4 mm/yr occurring just inland of the levee of the westernmost island and average subsidence of 11 mm/yr along the planned path of water conveyance tunnels through the Delta. The results are compared to local sea level rise (SLR), measured at a tidal gauge in San Francisco Bay, to show that subsidence is currently the dominant contributor to local relative sea level rise (RSLR) by nearly a factor of five. Based on recently measured and modeled acceleration of SLR, subsidence in the Delta is likely to dominate RSLR until the middle of the 21th century.	[Bekaert, David P.

Single-grain crushing experiments demonstrate that He and CO2 reside primarily in these inclusions. Low CO2 pressures in most grains, corresponding to depths of less than 1 km, provide evidence of ubiquitous decrepitation and associated pressure reduction in the fluid inclusions. Even so, the olivines with the highest inclusion volumes yielded sufficient He to obtain precise He concentrations and isotopic compositions. Within analytical uncertainty, He-3/He-4 ratios are homogeneous among the olivines from each basalt, but among basalts, the ratios range from 21 to 35 Ra. The total range in C/He-3 ratio within the analyzed olivines is from 3.6 x 10(7) to 1.5 x 10(10), and varies by nearly an order of magnitude within the olivines from each basalt. We postulate that this wide range of C/He-3 ratios is caused by grain-scale decoupling of C and He-3 due to extensive He diffusion out of fluid inclusions through the olivine lattice during magma ascent and cooling. If so, primary Ofu-Olosega magmas probably had C/He-3 ratios less than 4 x 10(8), which is lower than previous estimates for hotspot magmas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pandey, A; Anand, A				Pandey, Ambuj; Anand, Akash			Improved convergence of fast integral equation solvers for acoustic scattering by inhomogeneous penetrable media with discontinuous material interface	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Acoustic scattering; Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation; High-order methods; Integral equation methods; Pre-corrected trapezoidal rule; Addition theorem	TRAPEZOIDAL QUADRATURE-RULES; HIGH-ORDER ALGORITHM; NUMERICAL-SOLUTION; EFFICIENT; WAVES	In recent years, several fast solvers for the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation that mathematically models the scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by penetrable inhomogeneous obstacles, have been proposed. While many of these fast methodologies exhibit rapid convergence for smoothly varying scattering configurations, the rate for most of them reduce to either linear or quadratic when material properties are allowed to jump across the interface. A notable exception to this is a recently introduced Nystrom scheme (Anand et al., 2016 [22]) that utilizes a specialized quadrature in the boundary region for a high-order treatment of the material interface. In this text, we present a solution framework that relies on the specialized boundary integrator to enhance the convergence rate of other fast, low order methodologies without adding to their computational complexity of O (N log N) for an N-point discretization. In particular, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we explain its implementation to enhance the order to convergence of two schemes, one introduced by Duan and Rokhlin (2009) [13] that is based on a pre-corrected trapezoidal rule while the other by Bruno and Hyde (2004) [12] which relies on a suitable decomposition of the Green's function via Addition theorem. In addition to a detailed description of these methodologies, we also present a comparative performance study of the improved versions of these two and the Nystrom solver in Anand et al. (2016) [22] through a wide range of numerical experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A line-free method of monopoles for 3D dislocation dynamics	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS			English	Article						Dislocation dynamics; Dislocation transport; Discrete dislocations; Method of monopoles; Particle methods	APPROXIMATION SCHEMES; CRYSTAL; ENERGY	We develop an approximation scheme for three-dimensional dislocation dynamics in which the dislocation line density is concentrated at points, or monopoles. Every monopole carries a Burgers vector and an element of line. The monopoles move according to mobility kinetics driven by elastic and applied forces. The divergence constraint, expressing the requirement that the monopoles approximate a boundary, is enforced weakly. The fundamental difference with traditional approximation schemes based on segments is that in the present approach an explicit linear connectivity, or 'sequence', between the monopoles need not be defined. Instead, the monopoles move as an unstructured point set subject to the weak divergence constraint. In this sense, the new paradigm is 'line-free', i. e., it sidesteps the need to track dislocation lines. This attribute offers significant computational advantages in terms of simplicity, robustness and efficiency, as demonstrated by means of selected numerical examples. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Stochastic modeling of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization at finite strains in hcp metals	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS			English	Article						Recrystallization; Monte-Carlo; Homogenization; Magnesium; Polycrystal	GRAIN-GROWTH; CRYSTAL PLASTICITY; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; FOURIER-TRANSFORMS; FIELD MODEL; PHASE-FIELD; DEFORMATION	We present a model that aims to describe the effective, macroscale material response as well as the underlying mesoscale processes during discontinuous dynamic recrystallization under severe plastic deformation. Broadly, the model brings together two well-established but distinct approaches - first, a continuum crystal plasticity and twinning approach to describe complex deformation in the various grains, and second, a discrete Monte-Carlo-Potts approach to describe grain boundary migration and nucleation. The model is implemented within a finite-strain Fast Fourier Transform-based framework that allows for efficient simulations of recrystallization at high spatial resolution, while the grid-based Fourier treatment lends itself naturally to the Monte-Carlo approach. The model is applied to pure magnesium as a representative hexagonal closed packed metal, but is sufficiently general to admit extension to other material systems. Results demonstrate the evolution of the grain architecture in representative volume elements and the associated stress-strain history during the severe simple shear deformation typical of equal channel angular extrusion. We confirm that the recrystallization kinetics converge with increasing grid resolution and that the resulting model captures the experimentally observed transition from single-to multi-peak stress-strain behavior as a function of temperature and rate.

We introduce a resolution of singularities consisting of stable maps from nodal deformations of the curve into twisted flag varieties. As an application, we prove that the twisted intersection cohomology sheaf on Drinfeld's compactification is universally locally acyclic over the moduli stack of G-bundles at points sufficiently antidominant relative to their defect.

Production rate measurement of Tritium and other cosmogenic isotopes in Germanium with CDMSlite	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						Dark matter; Supercdms; CDMSIite; Germanium detectors; Cosmogenic activation	PARTIAL CROSS-SECTIONS; NUCLEAR-REACTIONS; ACTIVATION; NEUTRONS; EMISSION; YIELDS	Future direct searches for low-mass dark matter particles with germanium detectors, such as SuperCDMS SNOLAB, are expected to be limited by backgrounds from radioactive isotopes activated by cosmogenic radiation inside the germanium. There are limited experimental data available to constrain production rates and a large spread of theoretical predictions. We examine the calculation of expected production rates, and analyze data from the second run of the CDMS low ionization threshold experiment (CDM-Slite) to estimate the rates for several isotopes. We model the measured CDMSIite spectrum and fit for contributions from tritium and other isotopes. Using the knowledge of the detector history, these results are converted to cosmogenic production rates at sea level. The production rates in atoms/(kg.day) are 74 +/- 9 for H-3, 1.5 +/- 0.7 for Fe-55, 17 +/- 5 for Zn-65, and 30 +/- 18 for Ge-68. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A coupling was introduced between the tachyon field and the adjoint Higgs field on the D3-branes to lock the tachyon at the top of its potential hill and to model the bounce process, which is known as the Coupled Scalar and Tachyon Bounce (CSTB) Universe. The CSTB model has been shown to be ghost free, and it fulfils the null energy condition; in addition, it can also solve the Big Bang cosmic singularity problem. In this paper we conduct an extensive follow-up study of the parameter space of the CSTB model. In particular we are interested in the parameter values that can produce a single bounce to arrive at a radiation-dominated universe. We further establish that the CSTB universe is a viable alternative to inflation, as it can naturally produce a sufficient number of e-foldings in the locked inflation epoch and in the post-bounce expansion to overcome the four fundamental limitations of the Big Bang cosmology, which are flatness, horizon, homogeneity and singularity, resulting in a universe of the current size.

Towards measuring growth rates of pathogens during infections by D2O-labeling lipidomics	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PRESSURE CHEMICAL-IONIZATION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION; HEAVY-WATER; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BIOMARKER ANALYSIS; HYDROGEN ISOTOPES; POLAR LIPIDS; FATTY-ACIDS	Rationale Microbial growth rate is an important physiological parameter that is challenging to measure in situ, partly because microbes grow slowly in many environments. Recently, it has been demonstrated that generation times of S. aureus in cystic fibrosis (CF) infections can be determined by D2O-labeling of actively synthesized fatty acids. To improve species specificity and allow growth rate monitoring for a greater range of pathogens during the treatment of infections, it is desirable to accurately quantify trace incorporation of deuterium into phospholipids. Methods Lipid extracts of D2O-treated E. coli cultures were measured on liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) instruments equipped with time-of-flight (TOF) and orbitrap mass analyzers, and used for comparison with the analysis of fatty acids by isotope-ratio gas chromatography (GC)/MS. We then developed an approach to enable tracking of lipid labeling, by following the transition from stationary into exponential growth in pure cultures. Lastly, we applied D2O-labeling lipidomics to clinical samples from CF patients with chronic lung infections. Results Lipidomics facilitates deuterium quantification in lipids at levels that are useful for many labeling applications (>0.03 at% D). In the E. coli cultures, labeling dynamics of phospholipids depend largely on their acyl chains and between phospholipids we notice differences that are not obvious from absolute concentrations alone. For example, cyclopropyl-containing lipids reflect the regulation of cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, which is predominantly expressed at the beginning of stationary phase. The deuterium incorporation into a lipid that is specific for S. aureus in CF sputum indicates an average generation time of the pathogen on the order of one cell doubling per day. Conclusions This study demonstrates how trace level measurement of stable isotopes in intact lipids can be used to quantify lipid metabolism in pure cultures and provides guidelines that enable growth rate measurements in microbiome samples after incubation with a low percentage of D2O.

The Impact of Stochasticity and Its Control on a Model of the Inflammatory Response	COMPUTATION			English	Article						inflammation; mathematical model; stochasticity; noise	DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATION MODEL; REDUCED MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; ORGAN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME; IN-SILICO MODELS; PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABILITY; ENHANCED SENSITIVITY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; NOISE; INFORMATION; SIMULATION	The dysregulation of inflammation, normally a self-limited response that initiates healing, is a critical component of many diseases. Treatment of inflammatory disease is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the complexities underlying the inflammatory response, motivating the application of systems and computational biology techniques in an effort to decipher this complexity and ultimately improve therapy. Many mathematical models of inflammation are based on systems of deterministic equations that do not account for the biological noise inherent at multiple scales, and consequently the effect of such noise in regulating inflammatory responses has not been studied widely. In this work, noise was added to a deterministic system of the inflammatory response in order to account for biological stochasticity. Our results demonstrate that the inflammatory response is highly dependent on the balance between the concentration of the pathogen and the level of biological noise introduced to the inflammatory network. In cases where the pro- and anti-inflammatory arms of the response do not mount the appropriate defense to the inflammatory stimulus, inflammation transitions to a different state compared to cases in which pro- and anti-inflammatory agents are elaborated adequately and in a timely manner. In this regard, our results show that noise can be both beneficial and detrimental for the inflammatory endpoint. By evaluating the parametric sensitivity of noise characteristics, we suggest that efficiency of inflammatory responses can be controlled. Interestingly, the time period on which parametric intervention can be introduced efficiently in the inflammatory system can be also adjusted by controlling noise.

J	Aumann, HH; Behrangi, A; Wang, Y				Aumann, Hartmut H.; Behrangi, Ali; Wang, Yuan			Increased Frequency of Extreme Tropical Deep Convection: AIRS Observations and Climate Model Predictions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate sensitivity; severe storms; AIRS; climate models	SYSTEM MODEL; CLOUD; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL	Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data from the tropical oceans (30 degrees N to 30 degrees S) are used to derive the probability of the process resulting in deep convective clouds (DCCs) as function of the sea surface temperature (SST). For DCC at or below the tropopause the onset temperature of this process shifts at the same rate as the increase in the mean SST. For tropopause overshooting DCC, which are associated with extreme rain events, the shift of the onset temperature is slower, causing their frequency to increase by about 21%/K of warming of the oceans. This sensitivity is not inconsistent with the sensitivity of the increase of extreme deep convective rain in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 model for a warmer SST. The mean of the 36 fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models predicts a 2.7 K warmer tropical SST by the end of this century, resulting in a 60% increases in the frequency of tropopause overshooting DCC. Plain Language Summary We use 15 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations of the tropical oceans to derive the probability of the deep convective cloud (DCC) process as a function of the sea surface temperature. Based on this, the frequency of extreme (tropopause overshooting) DCCs will increase about 21% per 1 K of warming of the tropical oceans. Tropopause overshooting DCC are correlated with extreme rain rates. We evaluated the expected increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 model in a warmer tropical ocean. The increase of extreme rain rates in the model is consistent with the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder-derived increase in frequency of extreme DCC. The mean of the fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models predicts a 2.7 K increase in the surface temperature of the tropical oceans by the end of this century. This means that the frequency of extreme DCC in the tropical oceans could increase by about 60%.

BaBar Collaboration	Study of the reactions e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)pi(0)pi(0) and pi(+)pi(-) pi(0)pi(0)eta at center-of-mass energies from threshold to 4.35 GeV using initial-state radiation	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BABAR DETECTOR	We study the processes e(+)e--> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)pi(0)pi(0)gamma and pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)pi(0)eta gamma in which an energetic photon is radiated from the initial state. The data are collected with the BABAR detector at SLAC. About 14 000 and 4700 events, respectively, are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 469 fb(-1). The invariant mass of the hadronic final state defines the effective e(+)e(-) center-of-mass energy. From the mass spectra, the first precise measurement of the e(+)e--> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)pi(0)pi(0) cross section and the first measurement ever of the e(+)e--> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)pi(0)pi(0)eta cross section are performed. The center-of-mass energies range from threshold to 4.35 GeV. The systematic uncertainty is typically between 10% and 13%. The contributions from omega pi(0)pi(0), eta pi(+)pi(-) and other intermediate states are presented. We observe the J/psi and psi(2S) in most of these final states and measure the corresponding branching fractions, many of them for the first time.	[Lees, J.

CMS Collaboration	Search for pair-produced resonances decaying to quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at root s=13 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PRODUCTION CROSS-SECTIONS; PP COLLISIONS; 3-JET RESONANCES; ALGORITHMS; SQUARK	A general search for the pair production of resonances, each decaying to two quarks, is reported. The search is conducted separately for heavier resonances (masses above 400 GeV), where each of the four final-state quarks generates a hadronic jet resulting in a four-jet signature, and for lighter resonances (masses between 80 and 400 GeV), where the pair of quarks from each resonance is collimated and reconstructed as a single jet resulting in a two-jet signature. In addition, a b-tagged selection is applied to target resonances with a bottom quark in the final state. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1), from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The mass spectra are analyzed for the presence of new resonances, and are found to be consistent with standard model expectations. The results are interpreted in the framework of R-parity-violating supersymmetry assuming the pair production of scalar top quarks decaying via the hadronic coupling lambda ''(312) or lambda ''(323) and upper limits on the cross section as a function of the top squark mass are set. These results probe a wider range of masses than previously explored at the LHC, and extend the top squark mass limits in the (t) over tilde -> qq' scenario.	[Sirunyan, A.

J	Ahlers, M; Bustamante, M; Mu, SQ				Ahlers, Markus; Bustamante, Mauricio; Mu, Siqiao			Unitarity bounds of astrophysical neutrinos	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS	The flavor composition of astrophysical neutrinos observed at neutrino telescopes is related to the initial composition at their sources via oscillation-averaged flavor transitions. If the time evolution of the neutrino flavor states is unitary, the probability of neutrinos changing flavor is solely determined by the unitary mixing matrix that relates the neutrino flavor and propagation eigenstates. In this paper we derive general bounds on the flavor composition of TeV-PeVastrophysical neutrinos based on unitarity constraints. These bounds are useful for studying the flavor composition of high-energy neutrinos, where energy-dependent nonstandard flavor mixing can dominate over the standard mixing observed in accelerator, reactor, and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

Our approach enables high-fidelity detection of single atoms by imaging photons from the broad singlet transition while cooling on the narrow intercombination line, and we extend this technique to highly uniform two-dimensional tweezer arrays with 121 sites. Cooling during imaging is based on a previously unobserved narrow-line Sisyphus mechanism, which we predict to be applicable in a wide variety of experimental situations. Further, we demonstrate optically resolved sideband cooling of a single atom to near the motional ground state of a tweezer, which is tuned to a magic-trapping configuration achieved by elliptical polarization. Finally, we present calculations, in agreement with our experimental results, that predict a linear-polarization and polarization-independent magic crossing at 520(2) nm and 500.65(50) nm, respectively. Our results pave the way for a wide range of novel experimental avenues based on individually controlled alkaline-earth atoms in tweezers-from fundamental experiments in atomic physics to quantum computing, simulation, and metrology.

We demonstrate that a non-periodic cut pattern can cause a sheet to buckle into three-dimensional shapes, such as domes or patterns of wrinkles, when pulled at specific boundary points. These global buckling modes are observed in experiments and rationalized by an in-plane kinematic analysis that highlights the role of the geometric frustration arising from non-periodicity. The study focuses on elastic sheets, and is later extended to elastic-plastic materials to achieve shape retention. Our work illustrates a scalable route towards the fabrication of three-dimensional objects with nonzero Gaussian curvature from initially-flat sheets.

Processes such as drizzle and entrainment can lead to subadiabatic LWPmeasured. This study examines and its relationship to microphysical properties for 86 cloud events over the Northeast Pacific Ocean based on data collected during four separate summertime airborne campaigns. For the study region, was found to be 0.7660.134. For most cases, clouds with a low value of were found to have lower droplet number concentration (N-d), higher droplet effective radius (r(e)), higher relative dispersion (d), and higher rain rate (R). The subcloud aerosol concentration (N-a) was often less for the low- cases. The relationship between and the vertical profiles and cloud-top characteristics for both the cloud droplet-only spectrum and full spectrum (cloud and rain droplets) is also examined. Inclusion of rain droplets produced a larger change in d for the low- clouds as compared to the high- clouds. On average, R increased at cloud top for high- clouds but decreased at cloud top for low- clouds. Accounting for when estimating N-d from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrievals results in better agreement with in situ N-d values.

From Point to Area: Worldwide Assessment of the Representativeness of Monthly Surface Solar Radiation Records	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						surface solar radiation; representativeness; near-global assessment; decorrelation length; spatial sampling error; spatial sampling bias	SATELLITE-BASED RETRIEVAL; SHORTWAVE RADIATION; ENERGY-BALANCE; VALIDATION; IRRADIANCE; FLUXES; VARIABILITY; NETWORK; EUROPE; TRENDS	The representativeness of surface solar radiation (SSR) point observations is an important issue when using them in combination with gridded data. We conduct a comprehensive near-global (50 degrees Sto55 degrees N) analysis on the representativeness of SSR point observations on the monthly mean time scale. Thereto, we apply the existing concepts of decorrelation lengths (), spatial sampling biases (), and spatial sampling errors (epsilon) to three high-resolution gridded monthly mean SSR data sets (CLARA, SARAH-P, and SARAH-E) provided by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring. While quantifies the area for which a point observation is representative, and epsilon are uncertainty estimates with respect to the 1-degree reference grid (G). For this grid we find a near-global average (G)=3.4 degrees, (G)=1.4W/m(2), and epsilon(G)=7.6W/m(2) with substantial regional differences. Disregarding tropical, mountainous, and some coastal regions, monthly SSR point observations can largely be considered representative of a 1-degree grid. Since epsilon is an uncorrectable error the total uncertainty when combining point with 1-degree gridded data is roughly 40% higher than the uncertainty of station-based SSR measurements alone if a rigorous bias correction is applied. Cloud cover and terrain data can at maximum explain 50% of the patterns of the representativeness metrics. We apply our methodology to the stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. Overall, this study shows that representativeness is strongly dependent on local conditions and that all three metrics (, , and epsilon) must be considered for a comprehensive assessment of representativeness. Plain Language Summary Station-based observations are the most robust way to measure the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface (surface solar radiation [SSR]). These measurements are point observations yet are often used in combination with satellite or model data (e.g., for validation or for derivation of other quantities). The latter have a typical spatial extent up to a few hundred kilometers. Thus, it is important that the point observations are representative of this large area. In this paper, we show that the representativeness of SSR point observations varies regionally and is strongly dependent on local conditions. We find that some regions are problematic in terms of representativeness. However, in most regions SSR point observations can be considered representative for a 1-degree grid. We quantified additional uncertainties, which have to be taken into account when combining point and gridded data.

J	Simkovic, F; Smetana, A; Vogel, P				Simkovic, Fedor; Smetana, Adam; Vogel, Petr			0v beta beta and 2v beta beta nuclear matrix elements evaluated in closure approximation, neutrino potentials and SU(4) symmetry	PHYSICAL REVIEW C			English	Article							DOUBLE-BETA-DECAY; SINGLE-STATE DOMINANCE	The intimate relation between the Gamow-Teller part of the matrix element M-GT(0V) and the 2v beta beta closure matrix element M-cl(2V) is explained and explored. If the corresponding radial dependence C-cl(2v) (r) would be known, M-0v corresponding to any mechanism responsible for the 0v beta beta decay can be obtained as a simple integral. However, the M-cl(2v) values, and therefore also the functions C-cl(2v)(r), sensitively depend not only on the properties of the first few 1(+) states but also of higher-lying 1(+) states in the intermediate odd-odd nuclei. We show that the beta(-) and beta(+) amplitudes of such states typically have opposite relative signs, and their contributions reduce severally the M-cl(2V) values. We suggest that demanding that M-cl(2V) = 0 is a sensible alternative way, within the QRPA method, of determining the amount of renormalization of isoscalar particle-particle interaction strength g(pp)(T=0) Using such prescription, the matrix elements M-0v are evaluated; their values are not very different (<= 20%) from the usual QRPA values when g(pp)(T=0) is related to the known 2v beta beta half-lives. We note that vanishing values of M-cl(2V) are signs of a partial restoration of the spin-isospin SU(4) symmetry.

J	Roscher, D; Diehl, S; Buchhold, M				Roscher, Dietrich; Diehl, Sebastian; Buchhold, Michael			Phenomenology of first-order dark-state phase transitions	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							FIELD-THEORY; QUANTUM; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; EQUATION; DRIVEN; ORDER	Dark states are stationary states of a dissipative, Lindblad-type time evolution with zero von Neumann entropy, therefore representing examples of pure steady states. Nonequilibrium dynamics featuring a dark state recently gained a lot of attraction since their implementation in the context of driven-open quantum systems represents a viable possibility to engineer unique, pure states. Inspired by recent experimental progress with ultracold Rydberg ensembles, we analyze a driven many-body spin system, which displays a mean-field bistability between a dark steady state and a mixed steady state. As a function of the driving strength one observes a discontinuous phase transition that connects the zero entropy (dark) state with a finite entropy (mixed) state. The transition is characterized by a jump of the von Neumann entropy from zero to a finite value, which is of genuine nonequilibrium character. We analyze the relevant long wavelength fluctuations driving this transition by means of the renormalization group. This allows us to approach the nonequilibrium dark-state transition and identify similarities and clear differences to common, equilibrium phase transitions, to establish the phenomenology for a first-order dark-state phase transition, and to relate it to the dynamics in driven dissipative Rydberg ensembles.

Faster methods for contracting infinite two-dimensional tensor networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							MATRIX RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; MANY-BODY THEORIES; DENSITY-MATRIX; EXPONENTIAL OPERATORS; THERMODYNAMICS; ALGORITHMS; MODELS; CHAIN	We revisit the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method of Nishino and Okunishi for contracting two-dimensional (2D) tensor networks and demonstrate that its performance can be substantially improved by determining the tensors using an eigenvalue solver as opposed to the power method used in CTMRG. We also generalize the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) ansatz for diagonalizing 1D quantum Hamiltonians to the case of 2D transfer matrices and discuss similarities with the corner methods. These two new algorithms will be crucial to improving the performance of variational infinite projected entangled pair state (PEPS) methods.	[Fishman, M.

The analysis uses a combination of the final data sets of the BABAR and Belle experiments containing 471 x 10(6) and 772 x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs collected at the gamma(4S) resonance at the asymmetric-energy B factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at KEK, respectively. We measure sin 2 beta = 0.80 +/- 0.14(stat) +/- 0.06(syst) +/- 0.03(model) and cos 2 beta = 0.91 +/- 0.22(stat) +/- 0.09(syst) +/- 0.07(model). The result for the direct measurement of the angle is beta = (22.5 +/- 4.4(stat) +/- 1.2(syst) +/- 0.6(model))degrees. The last quoted uncertainties are due to the composition of the D-0 -> K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-) decay amplitude model, which is newly established by a Dalitz plot amplitude analysis of a high-statistics e(+) e(-) -> c (c) over bar data sample as part of this analysis. We find the first evidence for cos 2 beta > 0 at the level of 3.7 standard deviations. The measurement excludes the trigonometric multifold solution pi/2 - beta = (68.1 +/- 0.7)degrees at the level of 7.3 standard deviations and therefore resolves an ambiguity in the determination of the apex of the CKM Unitarity Triangle. The hypothesis of beta = 0 degrees is ruled out at the level of 5.1 standard deviations, and thus CP violation is observed in B-0 -> D-(*) h(0) decays. The measurement assumes no direct CP violation in B-0 -> D-(*) h(0) decays.	[Lees, J.

BaBar Collaboration; Belle Collaboration	First Evidence for cos 2 beta > 0 and Resolution of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa Quark-Mixing Unitarity Triangle Ambiguity	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							CP-VIOLATION; BABAR DETECTOR; DECAY; TOOL	We present first evidence that the cosine of the CP-violating weak phase 2 beta is positive, and hence exclude trigonometric multifold solutions of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) Unitarity Triangle using a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis of B-0 -> D-(*) h(0) with D -> K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-) decays, where h(0) is an element of {pi(0), eta, omega} denotes a light unflavored and neutral hadron. The measurement is performed combining the final data sets of the BABAR and Belle experiments collected at the (sic)(4S) resonance at the asymmetric-energy B factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at KEK, respectively. The data samples contain (471 +/- 3) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the BABAR detector and (772 +/- 11) x 10(6) B (B) over bar pairs recorded by the Belle detector. The results of the measurement are sin 2 beta = 0.80 +/- 0.14 (stat) +/- 0.06 (syst) +/- 0.03 (model) and cos 2 beta = 0.91 +/- 0.22(stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) +/- 0.07(model). The result for the direct measurement of the angle beta of the CKM Unitarity Triangle is beta = [22.5 +/- 4.4 (stat) +/- 1.2 (syst) +/- 0.6(model)]degrees. The measurement assumes no direct CP violation in B-0 -> D-(*) h(0) decays. The quoted model uncertainties are due to the composition of the D-0 -> K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-) decay amplitude model, which is newly established by performing a Dalitz plot amplitude analysis using a high-statistics e(+)e(-) -> c (c) over bar data sample. CP violation is observed in B-0 -> D-(*) h(0) decays at the level of 5.1 standard deviations. The significance for cos 2 beta > 0 is 3.7 standard deviations. The trigonometric multifold solution pi/2 - beta = (68.1 +/- 0.7)degrees is excluded at the level of 7.3 standard deviations. The measurement resolves an ambiguity in the determination of the apex of the CKM Unitarity Triangle.	[Lees, J.

Yeast require redox switching in DNA primase	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						DNA replication; DNA charge transport; iron-sulfur proteins	IRON-SULFUR CLUSTER; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CHARGE-TRANSPORT; REPAIR PROTEINS; 4FE4S CLUSTER; DOMAIN; SUBUNIT; BINDING; MECHANISM; INSIGHTS	Eukaryotic DNA primases contain a [4Fe4S] cluster in the C-terminal domain of the p58 subunit (p58C) that affects substrate affinity but is not required for catalysis. We show that, in yeast primase, the cluster serves as a DNA-mediated redox switch governing DNA binding, just as in human primase. Despite a different structural arrangement of tyrosines to facilitate electron transfer between the DNA substrate and [4Fe4S] cluster, in yeast, mutation of tyrosines Y395 and Y397 alters the same electron transfer chemistry and redox switch. Mutation of conserved tyrosine 395 diminishes the extent of p58C participation in normal redox-switching reactions, whereas mutation of conserved tyrosine 397 causes oxidative cluster degradation to the [3Fe4S](+) species during p58C redox signaling. Switching between oxidized and reduced states in the presence of the Y397 mutations thus puts primase [4Fe4S] cluster integrity and function at risk. Consistent with these observations, we find that yeast tolerate mutations to Y395 in p58C, but the single-residue mutation Y397L in p58C is lethal. Our data thus show that a constellation of tyrosines for protein-DNA electron transfer mediates the redox switch in eukaryotic primases and is required for primase function in vivo.

J	Wang, BY; Thachuk, C; Ellington, AD; Winfree, E; Soloveichik, D				Wang, Boya; Thachuk, Chris; Ellington, Andrew D.; Winfree, Erik; Soloveichik, David			Effective design principles for leakless strand displacement systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						molecular programming; DNA strand displacement cascades; robustness; leak	DNA NANOTECHNOLOGY; COMPUTATION; ROBUSTNESS; CIRCUITS; CASCADES; KINETICS; NETWORK; MOTOR	Artificially designed molecular systems with programmable behaviors have become a valuable tool in chemistry, biology, material science, and medicine. Although information processing in biological regulatory pathways is remarkably robust to error, it remains a challenge to design molecular systems that are similarly robust. With functionality determined entirely by secondary structure of DNA, strand displacement has emerged as a uniquely versatile building block for cell-free biochemical networks. Here, we experimentally investigate a design principle to reduce undesired triggering in the absence of input (leak), a side reaction that critically reduces sensitivity and disrupts the behavior of strand displacement cascades. Inspired by error correction methods exploiting redundancy in electrical engineering, we ensure a higher-energy penalty to leak via logical redundancy. Our design strategy is, in principle, capable of reducing leak to arbitrarily low levels, and we experimentally test two levels of leak reduction for a core "translator" component that converts a signal of one sequence into that of another. We show that the leak was not measurable in the high-redundancy scheme, even for concentrations that are up to 100 times larger than typical. Beyond a single translator, we constructed a fast and low-leak translator cascade of nine strand displacement steps and a logic OR gate circuit consisting of 10 translators, showing that our design principle can be used to effectively reduce leak in more complex chemical systems.

Phosphoramidate-Assisted Alkyne Activation: Probing the Mechanism of Proton Shuttling in a N,O-Chelated Cp*Ir(III) Complex	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							AUXILIARY BASIS-SETS; C-H ACTIVATION; GEOMETRY OPTIMIZATION; BOND ACTIVATION; METAL-COMPLEXES; VINYLIDENE; LIGANDS; IMPLEMENTATION; REACTIVITY	Ligand lability offers a unique opportunity for access to metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC), helping to direct new organometallic and catalytic reactions. In recent years, ligand-assisted C-H bond activation and, more generally, proton migration have been of particular interest. This paper describes a detailed computational study into the mechanism, as well as the region and stereoselectivity, observed in a recently reported transformation where MLC in a 16-electron iridium(III) phosphoramidate complex plays a critical role in directing the activation of terminal alkynes toward the generation of novel five-membered (E)-vinyloxyirida(III)cycles. Five possible pathways for the formation of such products were investigated. Based on our findings, it is proposed that the reaction proceeds via a ligand-assisted proton shuttle (LAPS) mechanism, where the phosphoramidate phosphoryl (P=O) group assists in both alkyne C-H bond activation and C-H bond formation to form a vinylidene intermediate. Next, C-O bond formation occurs via nucleophilic attack at the a-carbon of the vinylidene, giving the observed product. Although C-N (and not C-O) bond formation is thermodynamically favored in this model system, this trend is not observed experimentally, and the computational study suggests that the observed regioisomer is simply the kinetic reaction product. In terms of stereoselectivity, formation of the (E)-irida(III)cycle is explained by its thermodynamic stability, when compared to that of the Z-isomer, and the relatively low barrier to interconversion between them.

Low-pressure gas chromatography with chemical ionization mass spectrometry for quantification of multifunctional organic compounds in the atmosphere	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							AIR-QUALITY; OXIDATION-PRODUCTS; ISOPRENE NITRATES; PHASE REACTIONS; CALIFORNIA; OZONE; FATE; OH; INSTRUMENTATION; HYDROPEROXIDES	Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) are formed during the oxidation of gas-phase hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. However, analytical challenges have hampered ambient measurements for many of these species, leaving unanswered questions regarding their atmospheric fate. We present the development of an in situ gas chromatography (GC) technique that, when combined with the sensitive and specific detection of chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS), is capable of the isomer-resolved detection of a wide range of OVOCs. The instrument addresses many of the issues typically associated with chromatographic separation of such compounds (e.g., analyte degradation). The performance of the instrumentation is assessed through data obtained in the laboratory and during two field studies. We show that this instrument is able to successfully measure otherwise difficult-to-quantify compounds (e.g., organic hydroperoxides and organic nitrates) and observe the diurnal variations in a number of their isomers.

J	Peng, Y; Refael, G				Peng, Yang; Refael, Gil			Time-quasiperiodic topological superconductors with Majorana multiplexing	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							FERMIONS	Time-quasiperiodic Majoranas are generalizations of Floquet Majoranas in time-quasiperiodic superconducting systems. We show that in a system driven at d mutually irrational frequencies, there are up to 2(d) types of such Majoranas, coexisting despite spatial overlap and lack of time-translational invariance. Although the quasienergy spectrum is dense in such systems, the time-quasiperiodic Majoranas can be stable and robust against resonances due to localization in periodic-drive-induced synthetic dimensions. This is demonstrated in a time-quasiperiodic Kitaev chain driven at two frequencies. We further relate the existence of multiple Majoranas in a time-quasiperiodic system to the time-quasicrystal phase introduced recently. These time-quasiperiodic Majoranas open a possibility for braiding which will be pursued in the future.

Observation of Breathing Dark Pulses in Normal Dispersion Optical Microresonators	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							KERR FREQUENCY COMB; SOLITONS; INSTABILITIES; STABILITY	Breathers are localized waves in nonlinear systems that undergo a periodic variation in time or space. The concept of breathers is useful for describing many nonlinear physical systems including granular lattices, Bose-Einstein condensates, hydrodynamics, plasmas, and optics. In optics, breathers can exist in either the anomalous or the normal dispersion regimes, but they have only been characterized in the former, to our knowledge. Here, externally pumped optical microresonators are used to characterize the breathing dynamics of localized waves in the normal dispersion regime. High-Q optical microresonators featuring normal dispersion can yield mode-locked Kerr combs whose time-domain waveform corresponds to circulating dark pulses in the cavity. We show that with relatively high pump power these Kerr combs can enter a breathing regime, in which the time-domain waveform remains a dark pulse but experiences a periodic modulation on a time scale much slower than the microresonator round trip time. The breathing is observed in the optical frequency domain as a significant difference in the phase and amplitude of the modulation experienced by different spectral lines. In the highly pumped regime, a transition to a chaotic breathing state where the waveform remains dark-pulse-like is also observed, for the first time to our knowledge; such a transition is reversible by reducing the pump power.

J	Liu, K; Zhang, PF; Wu, JZ				Liu, Kun; Zhang, Pengfei; Wu, Jianzhong			Does capillary evaporation limit the accessibility of nonaqueous electrolytes to the ultrasmall pores of carbon electrodes?	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; RESTRICTED-PRIMITIVE MODEL; FUNDAMENTAL-MEASURE-THEORY; TEMPERATURE IONIC LIQUID; ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; PHASE-BEHAVIOR; THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES; STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; SLITLIKE PORES; CAPACITANCE	Porous carbons have been widely utilized as electrode materials for capacitive energy storage. Whereas the importance of pore size and geometry on the device performance has been well recognized, little guidance is available for identification of carbon materials with ideal porous structures. In this work, we study the phase behavior of ionic fluids in slit pores using the classical density functional theory. Within the framework of the restricted primitive model for nonaqueous electrolytes, we demonstrate that the accessibility of micropores depends not only on the ionic diameters (or desolvation) but also on their wetting behavior intrinsically related to the vapor-liquid or liquid-liquid phase separation of the bulk ionic systems. Narrowing the pore size from several tens of nanometers to subnanometers may lead to a drastic reduction in the capacitance due to capillary evaporation. The wettability of micropores deteriorates as the pore size is reduced but can be noticeably improved by raising the surface electrical potential. The theoretical results provide fresh insights into the properties of confined ionic systems beyond electric double layer models commonly employed for rational design/selection of electrolytes and electrode materials.

In this paper, we presented the first calorimetry and timing performance measurement of Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) as the active material of sampling calorimeter, using 2 GeV to 200 GeV electron beam from CERN beam lines. A good energy performance is achieved due to the better sensitivity of CdTe to X ray photons in the secondary shower than other semi-conducting sensors such as silicon. The timing resolution of the tested CdTe sensor is measured to be down to 21 ps under the best conditions. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

To realistically resolve the 3-D development of a spill on the ocean surface and in the water column, recently published parameterizations for the vertical mixing of oil spills are implemented in the open-source trajectory framework OpenDrift (https://doi org/10.5281/zenodo.1300358, last access: 7 April 2018). The parameterizations include the wave entrainment of oil, two alternative formulations for the droplet size spectra, and turbulent mixing. The performance of the integrated oil spill model is evaluated by comparing model simulations with airborne observations of an oil slick. The results show that an accurate description of a chain of physical processes, in particular vertical mixing and oil weathering, is needed to represent the horizontal spreading of the oil spill. Using ensembles of simulations of hypothetic oil spills, the general drift behavior of an oil spill during the first 10 days after initial spillage is evaluated in relation to how vertical processes control the horizontal transport. Transport of oil between the surface slick and the water column is identified as a crucial component affecting the horizontal transport of oil spills. The vertical processes are shown to control differences in the drift of various types of oil and in various weather conditions.

However, finding the right TCR T cell clone is a tedious, time-consuming, and costly process. Thus, there is a critical need for single cell technologies to conduct fast and multiplexed functional analyses followed by recovery of the clone of interest. Here, we use droplet microfluidics for functional screening and real-time monitoring of single TCR T cell activation upon recognition of target tumor cells. Notably, our platform includes a tracking system for each clone as well as a sorting procedure with 100% specificity validated by downstream single cell reverse-transcription PCR and sequencing of TCR chains. Our TCR screening prototype will facilitate immunotherapeutic screening and development of T cell therapies.

Gaia 17bpi: An FU Ori-type Outburst	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; stars: activity; stars: general; stars: pre-main sequence; stars: variables: general; stars: winds, outflows	ERUPTIVE VARIABLE PROTOSTARS; GALACTIC PLANE; INFRARED SURVEY; TELESCOPE; STARS	We report on the source Gaia 17bpi and identify it as a new, ongoing FU Ori-type outburst, associated with a young stellar object. The optical light curve from Gaia exhibited a 3.5 mag rise with the source appearing to plateau in mid-/late 2018. Mid-infrared observations from NEOWISE also show a >3 mag rise that occurred in two stages, with the second one coincident with the optical brightening, and the first one preceding the optical brightening by similar to 1.5 yr. We model the outburst as having started between October and December of 2014. This wavelength-dependent aspect of young star accretion-driven outbursts has never been documented before. Both the mid-infrared and the optical colors of the object become bluer as the outburst proceeds. Optical spectroscopic characteristics in the outburst phase include: a GK-type absorption spectrum, strong wind/outflow in, e.g., Mgb, NaD, H alpha, K I, O I, and Ca II profiles, and detection of Li I 6707 angstrom. The infrared spectrum in the outburst phase is similar to that of an M-type spectrum, notably exhibiting prominent H2O and (CO)-C-12 (2-0) bandhead absorption in the K band, and likely He I wind in the Y band. The new FU Ori source Gaia 17bpi is associated with a little-studied dark cloud in the galactic plane, located at a distance of 1.27 kpc.

For AGNs off the Galactic plane, it has been possible to use existing X-ray archival data to improve source localizations, identify optical counterparts, and classify the AGNs with optical spectroscopy. However, near the Galactic plane, better X-ray positions are necessary to achieve optical or near-IR identifications due to the higher levels of source crowding. Thus, we have used observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory to obtain the best possible X-ray positions. With eight observations, we have obtained coverage for 19 NuSTAR serendips within 12 degrees of the plane. One or two Chandra sources are detected within the error circle of 15 of the serendips, and we report on these sources and search for optical counterparts. For one source (NuSTAR J202421+3350.9), we obtained a new optical spectrum and detected the presence of hydrogen emission lines. The source is Galactic, and we argue that it is likely a cataclysmic variable. For the other sources, the Chandra positions will enable future classifications in order to place limits on faint Galactic populations, including high-mass X-ray binaries and magnetars.

The Distribution of Active Galactic Nuclei in Galaxy Clusters at z similar to 1	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; infrared: galaxies; radio continuum: galaxies	EFFICIENT PHOTOMETRIC SELECTION; X-RAY; HOST GALAXIES; EVOLUTION; RADIO; QUASARS; SKY; STELLAR; CONSTRAINTS; FRACTION	We present an analysis of the radial distribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in 2300 galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Survey (MaDCoWS). MaDCoWS provides the largest coverage of the extragalactic sky for a cluster sample at z similar to 1. We use literature catalogs of AGNs selected via optical, midinfrared (MIR), and radio data, and by optical-to-MIR (OIR) color. Stacking the radial distribution of AGNs within the 6' of the centers of MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, we find a distinct overdensity of AGNs within 1' of the galaxy cluster center for AGNs of all selection methods. The fraction of red galaxies that host AGNs as a function of clustercentric distance is, however, dependent on the AGN selection. The fraction of red galaxies in cluster environments that host AGNs selected by optical signatures or blue OIR color is at a deficit compared to the field, whereas MIR-selected and red OIR color AGNs are enhanced in the centers of clusters when compared to field levels. The radio-selected AGN fraction is more than 2.5 times that of the field, implying that the centers of clusters are conducive to the triggering of radio emission in AGNs. We do not find a statistically significant change in the AGN fraction as a function of cluster richness. We also investigate the correlation of central radio activity with other AGNs in galaxy clusters. Clusters with radio activity have more central AGNs than do radio-inactive clusters, implying that central cluster radio activity and AGN triggering may be linked.

We present the most complete published sample of high angular resolution H- and K-band observations of the stars HD 163296 and HD 190073, including 30 previously unpublished nights of observations of the former and 45 nights of the latter with the CHARA long-baseline interferometer, in addition to archival VLTI data. We confirm previous observations suggesting that significant near-infrared emission originates within the putative dust evaporation front of HD. 163296 and show that this is the case for HD 190073 as well. The H- and K-band sizes are the same within (3 +/- 3)% for HD 163296 and within (6 +/- 10)% for HD 190073. The radial surface brightness profiles for both disks are remarkably Gaussian-like with little or no sign of the sharp edge expected for a dust evaporation front. Coupled with spectral energy distribution analysis, our direct measurements of the stellar flux component at the H and K bands suggest that HD 190073 is much younger (<400 kyr) and more massive (similar to 5.6M(circle dot)) than previously thought, mainly as a consequence of the new Gaia distance (891 pc).

CMS Collaboration	Angular analysis of the decay B+ -> K+mu(+)mu(-) in proton-proton collisions at root s=8 TeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							PARTICLE; B-0	The angular distribution of the flavor-changing neutral current decay B+ -> K+mu(+)mu(-) is studied in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The analysis is based on data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.5 fb(-1). The forward-backward asymmetry A(FB) of the dimuon system and the contribution F-H from the pseudoscalar, scalar, and tensor amplitudes to the decay width are measured as a function of the dimuon mass squared. The measurements are consistent with the standard model expectations.	[Sirunyan, A.

The Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey (KLCS)-. The Emergent Ionizing Spectrum of Galaxies at z similar to 3	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmology: observations; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift intergalactic medium; ultraviolet: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; REST-FRAME ULTRAVIOLET; EMISSION-LINE GALAXIES; SPACE-TELESCOPE SEARCH; UV LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; LY-ALPHA EMISSION; FAINT-END SLOPE; HIGH-REDSHIFT; INTERSTELLAR-MEDIUM; ESCAPE FRACTION	We present results of a deep spectroscopic survey quantifying the statistics of the escape of ionizing radiation from star -forming galaxies at z similar to 3. We measure the ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing UV flux density f(900)/f(1500)obs, where f(900) is the mean flux density evaluated over the range [880, 910] angstrom. We quantify the emergent ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing UV flux density by analyzing high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectra formed from subsamples with common observed properties and numbers sufficient to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the modeled IGM+CGM correction to obtain precise values of < f(900)/f(1500)>(out), including a full-sample average < f(900)/f(1500)>(out) 0.057 +/- 0.006. We show that < f(900)/f(1500)>(out) increases., monotonically with W lambda(Ly alpha), inducing an inverse correlation with UV luminosity as a by-product. We fit the composite spectra using stellar spectral synthesis together with models of the ISM in which a fraction f(c) of the stellar continuum is covered by gas with column density NH (I). We show that the composite spectra simultaneously constrain the intrinsic properties of the stars (L90041500)int along with f(c), N-H (I), E (B - V), and f(esc,abs), the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons. We find a sample-averaged f(esc,abs) 0.09 +/- 0.01, with subsamples falling along a linear relation < f(esc),(abs)> similar or equal to 0.75[W-lambda(Ly alpha)/110 angstrom]. Using the far-UV luminosity function, the distribution function n(W(Lya)), and the relationship between WA(Ly alpha) and < f(900)/f(1500)>(out), we estimate the total ionizing emissivity of z similar to 3 star forming galaxies with M-uv <= -19.5, which exceeds the contribution of quasi-stellar objects by a factor of similar to 3, and accounts for similar to 50% of the total is an element of(Lyc) at z similar to 3 estimated using indirect methods.

Gravitational-wave Geodesy: A New Tool for Validating Detection of the Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						gravitational waves; methods: data analysis; methods: statistical	EFFICIENT	A valuable target for advanced gravitational-wave detectors is the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The stochastic background imparts a weak correlated signal into networks of gravitational-wave detectors, and so standard searches for the gravitational-wave background rely on measuring cross-correlations between pairs of widely separated detectors. Stochastic searches, however, can be affected by any other correlated effects that may also be present, including correlated frequency combs and magnetic Schumann resonances. As stochastic searches become sensitive to ever-weaker signals, it is increasingly important to develop methods to separate a true astrophysical signal from other spurious and/or terrestrial signals. Here, we describe a novel method to achieve this goal-gravitational-wave geodesy. Just as radio geodesy allows for the localization of radio telescopes, so too can observations of the gravitational-wave background be used to infer the positions and orientations of gravitational-wave detectors. By demanding that a true observation of the gravitational-wave background yield constraints that are consistent with the baseline's known geometry, we demonstrate that we can successfully validate true observations of the gravitational-wave background while rejecting spurious signals due to correlated terrestrial effects.

[C II] as a Tracer of Star Formation	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						catalogs; editorials, notices; miscellaneous; surveys	NEARBY GALAXIES; EMISSION; LINE; M83; AGN	We present a [C II] 158 mu m map of the entire M51 (including M51b) grand design spiral galaxy observed with the Far Infrared Field-Imaging Line Spectrometer (FIFI-LS) instrument on board the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). We compare the [C II] emission with the total far-infrared (TIR) intensity and star formation rate (SFR) surface density maps (derived using Ha and 24 mu m emission) to study the relationship between [C II] and the star formation activity in a variety of environments within M51 on scales of 16 '' corresponding to similar to 660 pc. We find that [C II] and the SFR surface density are well correlated in the central, spiral arm, and inter-arm regions. The correlation is in good agreement with that found for a larger sample of nearby galaxies at kpc scales. We find that the SFR, and [C II] and TIR luminosities in M51, are dominated by the extended emission in M51's disk. The companion galaxy M51b, however, shows a deficit of [C II] emission compared with the TIR emission and SFR surface density, with [C II] emission detected only in the SW part of this galaxy. The [C II] deficit is associated with an enhanced dust temperature in this galaxy. We interpret the faint [C II] emission in M51b to be a result of suppressed star formation in this galaxy, while the bright mid-and far-infrared emission, which drive the TIR and SFR values, are powered by other mechanisms. A similar but less-pronounced effect is seen at the location of the black hole in M51's center. The observed [C II] deficit in M51b suggests that this galaxy is a valuable laboratory to study the origin of the apparent [C II] deficit observed in ultra-luminous galaxies.

Calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope Filters as Star Formation Rate Indicators	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: general; galaxies: photometry; stars: formation	EMISSION-LINE KINEMATICS; SAURON PROJECT; H-ALPHA; STELLAR; GALAXY; ABSORPTION; SPECTRA	We have calibrated the 6.5m James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) mid-infrared (MIR) filters as star formation rate (SFR) indicators, using JWST photometry synthesized from Spitzer spectra of 49 low-redshift galaxies, which cover a wider luminosity range than most previous studies. We use Balmer-decrement-corrected Ha luminosity and synthesized MIR photometry to empirically calibrate the Spitzer, WISE, and JWST filters as SFR indicators. Our Spitzer and WISE calibrations are in good agreement with recent calibrations from the literature. While MIR luminosity may be directly proportional to SFR for high-luminosity galaxies, we find a power-law relationship between MIR luminosity and SFR for low-luminosity galaxies (L-H alpha <= 10(43) erg s(-1)). We find that for galaxies with an Ha luminosity of 10(40) erg s(-1) (corresponding to an SFR of similar to 0.055 M-circle dot yr(-1).), the corresponding JWST MIR nu L-nu luminosity is between 10(40.50) and 1041.00 erg s(-1). Power-law fits of JWST luminosity as a function of Ha luminosity have indices between 1.17 and 1.32. We find that the scatter in the JWST filter calibrations decreases with increasing wavelength from 0.39 to 0.20. dex, although F1000W is an exception where the scatter is just 0.24. dex.

Measuring cis-regulatory energetics in living cells using allelic manifolds	ELIFE			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATION; DEPENDENT PROMOTERS; LACTOSE OPERON; BINDING-SITE; CRP; DISSECTION; SEQUENCE; COMPLEX; LAMBDA; CAP	Gene expression in all organisms is controlled by cooperative interactions between DNA-bound transcription factors (TFs), but quantitatively measuring TF-DNA and TF-TF interactions remains difficult. Here we introduce a strategy for precisely measuring the Gibbs free energy of such interactions in living cells. This strategy centers on the measurement and modeling of 'allelic manifolds', a multidimensional generalization of the classical genetics concept of allelic series. Allelic manifolds are measured using reporter assays performed on strategically designed cis-regulatory sequences. Quantitative biophysical models are then fit to the resulting data. We used this strategy to study regulation by two Escherichia coli TFs, CRP and sigma(70) RNA polymerase. Doing so, we consistently obtained energetic measurements precise to similar to 0.1 kcal/mol. We also obtained multiple results that deviate from the prior literature. Our strategy is compatible with massively parallel reporter assays in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and should therefore be highly scalable and broadly applicable. Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that minor issues remain unresolved (see decision letter).

Distinct activity-gated pathways mediate attraction and aversion to CO2 in Drosophila	NATURE			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; INTEGRATION; RECEPTORS; RESPONSES; TRACKING; BEHAVIOR; PLUMES	Carbon dioxide is produced by many organic processes and is a convenient volatile cue for insects(1) that are searching for blood hosts(2), flowers(3), communal nests(4), fruit(5) and wildfires(6). Although Drosophila melanogaster feed on yeast that produce CO2 and ethanol during fermentation, laboratory experiments(7-12) suggest that walking flies avoid CO2. Here we resolve this paradox by showing that both flying and walking Drosophila find CO2 attractive, but only when they are in an active state associated with foraging. Their aversion to CO2 at low-activity levels may be an adaptation to avoid parasites that seek CO2, or to avoid succumbing to respiratory acidosis in the presence of high concentrations of CO2 that exist in nature(13,14.) In contrast to CO2, flies are attracted to ethanol in all behavioural states, and invest twice the time searching near ethanol compared to CO2. These behavioural differences reflect the fact that ethanol is a unique signature of yeast fermentation, whereas CO2 is generated by many natural processes. Using genetic tools, we determined that the evolutionarily conserved ionotropic coreceptor IR25a is required for CO2 attraction, and that the receptors necessary for CO2 avoidance are not involved in this attraction. Our study lays the foundation for future research to determine the neural circuits that underlie both state-and odorant-dependent decisionmaking in Drosophila.

Data from this satellite are being exploited to improve forecasting of extreme weather events and delivery of disaster response. International core validation sites (CVSs) have been contributing in situ soil moisture data to validate and calibrate SMAP soil moisture products. Overall the soil moisture retrieval errors have exceeded SMAP's mission requirement (errors below 0.04 m(3) m(-3)), with the exception of some sites of annual cropland as present at the Carman (Canada) CVS. In 2016, a SMAP validation experiment was conducted at the Canadian site in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB) in an attempt to understand the differences between the SMAP soil moisture retrievals and the permanent in situ network observations. The research presented here analyzed the performance of this network in representing soil moisture within a SMAP pixel and tested five upscaling approaches. Comparisons between the permanent network and SMAPVEX16-MB measurements (from temporary stations and field measures) confirmed agreement among these three sources of soil moisture measures. The SMAP soil moisture values were compared with in situ soil moisture upscaled from the four tested approaches as well as soil moisture estimated by the NOAH Land Surface Model (LSM). There were similar discrepancies when analyzing all methods (RMSE 0.072-0.074 m(3) m(-3) for the four upscaling methods; 0.076 m(3) m(-3) for the LSM approach), yielding no reduction in the soil moisture RMSE for this site. The SMAP team will continue to investigate other factors that may be contributing to errors above 0.04 m(3) m(-3) at these annually cropped CVSs.	[Bhuiyan, Hassan A. K.

J	Mahjoub, A; Hodyss, R				Mahjoub, Ahmed; Hodyss, Robert			Thermal Reaction in Cometary and Pre-cometary Ices: Formation of Thiocarbamate in OCS-CH3NH2 Mixed Ices	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrobiology; astrochemistry; comets: general; methods: laboratory: solid state	CORRELATED MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; SOLID-STATE; ACID; CARBAMATE; SULFUR; IRRADIATION; CH3NHCOOH	Cometary ices are rich sources of organic molecules relevant to prebiotic chemistry and may have played a key role in the delivery of the building blocks of life to Earth. Comets endure thermal processing of their surfaces during their orbits around the Sun. Furthermore, icy grain precursors of cometary materials may have experienced heating in the solar nebula. Despite the important role that this thermal processing could play in the chemistry of ices, little effort has been devoted to understanding the purely thermal reactivity involving electronically stable molecules. Both methylamine (CH3NH2) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) have been detected in the cometary coma of comets, particularly in 67P-Churyumov-Geramenisko (67P) visited by the Rosetta spacecraft. We present here the first laboratory study addressing the reactivity induced by thermal processing of methylamine and OCS mixed ice. Mimicking a realistic scenario within which the surface of the comet is thermally processed as a result of its path close to the Sun, we demonstrate that the methylthiocarbamate anion in salt with methylammonium, [CH3NHOCS](-) [CH3NH3](+), and thiocarbamic acid dimer are formed by nucleophilic addition of OCS on methylamine. This study shows that a thermally driven reaction chemically analogous to the one proposed as a condensing pathway of amino acids in the early Earth may take place in cometary ice. The formed thiocarbamate is a known intermediate in the formation of peptides. Furthermore, the consumption of OCS by this reaction with methylamine may account for the missing sulfur in dense clouds and protostars.

The sensor consists of a liquid channel forming a Fabry-Perot cavity between two semitransparent Ag/SiO2 reflective surfaces. Light is transmitted through the cavity to construct interference peaks in the transmission spectra which depend on the refractive index of the test samples in the channel. The refractive index of glucose, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride solutions is measured in different concentrations. Continuous change in refractive index is resolved by observing the peak wavelength shift in the transmitted spectrum. The sensor is characterized using the contact angle measurer, surface profilometer, and spectrophotometer. The proposed Fabry-Perot etalon biosensor shows real time linear responses as well as high accuracy and sensitivity of 10(-3) refractive index per percent of glucose, 1.4x10(-3) and 1.8x10(-3) refractive index per percent of KCl and NaCl solution, respectively.

It has been demonstrated in various chalcopyrite systems, including compounds with quaternary chalcopyrite-like structures, that the lattice parameter ratio, c/a, being exactly 2.00 to have a pseudocubic structure is key to increase the degeneracy at the valence band edge and ultimately achieve high TE performance. Considering the fact that ZnSnSb2 with a chalcopyrite structure is reported to have c/a close to 2.00, it is expected to have multiple valence bands leading to a high p-type zT. However, there are no complete investigations on the high temperature TE properties of ZnSnSb2 mainly because of the difficulty of obtaining a single-phase ZnSnSb2. In the present study, pure ZnSnSb2 samples with no impurities are synthesized successfully using a Sn flux-based method and TE properties are characterized up to 585 K. Transport properties and thermal analysis indicate that the structure of ZnSnSb2 remains chalcopyrite with no order- disorder transition and clearly show that ZnSnSb2 can be made to exhibit a high zT in the low-to-mid temperature range through further optimization.

The CMS collaboration	Event shape variables measured using multijet final states in proton-proton collisions at root s=13 TeV	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Jet physics; Jets	E(+)E(-) ANNIHILATION; PP COLLISIONS; QCD	The study of global event shape variables can provide sensitive tests of predictions for multijet production in proton-proton collisions. This paper presents a study of several event shape variables calculated using jet four momenta in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and uses data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb(-1). After correcting for detector effects, the resulting distributions are compared with several theoretical predictions. The agreement generally improves as the energy, represented by the average transverse momentum of the two leading jets, increases.	[Sirunyan, A.

Square tiles have been developed to construct micrometer-scale arrays and to generate patterns using stochastic or deterministic strategies. Here we show triangular tiles as a comple-mentary approach for enriching the design space of DNA tilings and for extending the shape of the self-assembled arrays from 2D to 3D. We introduce a computational approach for maximizing binding specificity in a fully symmetric tile design, with which we construct a 20-tile structure resembling a rhombic triacontahedron. We demonstrate controlled transition between 3D and 2D structures using simple methods including tile concentration, magnesium, and fold symmetry in tile edge design. Using these approaches, we construct 2D arrays with unbounded and designed sizes. The programmability of the edge design and the flexibility of the structure make the triangular DNA origami tile an ideal building block for complex self-assembly and reconfiguration in artificial molecular machines and fabricated nanodevices.

Subtle Changes in Lipid Environment Have Profound Effects on Membrane Oxidation Chemistry	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							INDUCED DROPLET IONIZATION; CRIEGEE INTERMEDIATE; CHAIN PACKING; WATER; OH; ACID; CHOLESTEROL; MECHANISM	Nature carefully designs the components of amphiphile-composed monolayer and bilayer membranes to deliver specific functions. The compositions of these interfacial layered structures are so delicate that minute modifications can result in huge changes in function. Great effort has been expended to understand membrane physical properties, with only minimum attention given to associated chemical properties. Here we report the first examples of the delicate chemistry associated with membrane amphiphilic components by studying OH-mediated oxidation of six different unsaturated lipids/surfactants and their mixtures at the air-water interface using field-induced droplet ionization mass spectrometry (FIDI-MS). When the packing is loose or perturbed to be loose by other components or prior chemical modification, the double bond is oxidized without cleavage by adding oxygen functionality. In contrast, compact packing results in double bond cleavage through a Criegee intermediate mechanism. We postulate that constrained environments imposed by lipid packing limit the conformations of the reaction intermediates, controlling reaction pathways.

We illustrate this approach by applying it to determine the optimum dopants (our of 35 candidates) to improve the turnover frequency (TOF) for the Fe-based Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process. We start from the QM-based free-energy reaction network for this reaction over Fe(111), which contains the 26 most important surface configurations and 17 transition states at operating conditions of temperature and pressure, from which we select the key reaction steps that might become rate determining for the alloy. These are arranged hierarchically by decreasing free-energy reaction barriers. We then extract from the full reaction network, a reduced set of reaction rates required to quickly predict the effect of the catalyst changes on each barrier. This allows us to test new candidates with only 1% of the effort for a full calculation. Thus, we were able to quickly screen 34 candidate dopants to select a small subset (Rh, Pt, Pd, Cu) that satisfy all criteria, including stability. Then from these four candidates expected to increase the TOF for NH3 production, we selected the best candidate (Rh) for a more complete free-energy and kinetic analysis (10 times the effort for HHTS but still 10% of the effort for a complete analysis of the full reaction network). We predict that Rh doping of Fe will increase the TOF for NH3 synthesis by a factor of similar to 3.3 times compared to Fe(111), in excellent agreement with our HHTS predictions, validating this approach.

Highly Active Platinum Catalysts for Nitrile and Cyanohydrin Hydration: Catalyst Design and Ligand Screening via High-Throughput Techniques	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							IRIDIUM HYDRIDE COMPLEXES; METAL-COMPLEXES; LEWIS-ACID; WATER; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; KINETICS	Nitrile hydration provides access to amides that are indispensable to researchers in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Prohibiting the use of this venerable reaction, however, are (1) the dearth of biphasic catalysts that can effectively hydrate nitriles at ambient temperatures with high turnover numbers and (2) the unsolved challenge of hydrating cyanohydrins. Herein, we report the design of new "donor-acceptor"-type platinum catalysts by precisely arranging electron-rich and electron-deficient ligands trans to one other, thereby enhancing both the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group and the electrophilicity of the nitrile group. Leveraging a high-throughput, automated workflow and evaluating a library of bidentate ligands, we have discovered that commercially available, inexpensive DPPF [1,1'-ferrocenendiyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)] provides superior reactivity. The corresponding "donor-acceptor"-type catalyst 2a is readily prepared from (DPPF)PtCl2, PMe2OH, and AgOTf. The enhanced activity of 2a permits the hydration of a wide range of nitriles and cyanohydrins to proceed at 40 degrees C with excellent turnover numbers. Rational reevaluation of the ligand structure has led to the discovery of modified catalyst 2c, harboring the more electron-rich 1,1'-bis[bis(5-methyl-2-furanyl)phosphino] ferrocene ligand, which demonstrates the highest activity toward hydration of nitriles and cyanohydrins at room temperature. Finally, the correlation between the electron-donating ability of the phosphine ligands with catalyst efficiencies of 2a, 2c, 2d, and 2e in the hydration of nitrile 7 are examined, and the results support the "donor-acceptor" hypothesis.

It can be used to measure a variety of atmospheric constituents at very high temporal and spatial resolutions. While the number of lidars continues to increase worldwide, there is generally a dependency on an operator, particularly for high-powered lidar systems. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) has recently developed a fully autonomous, mobile lidar system called AMOLITE (Autonomous Mobile Ozone Lidar Instrument for Tropospheric Experiments) to simultaneously measure the vertical profile of tropospheric ozone, aerosol and water vapor (night-time only) from near the ground to altitudes reaching 10 to 15 km. This current system uses a dual-laser, dual-lidar design housed in a single climate-controlled trailer. Ozone profiles are measured by the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique using a single 1 m Raman cell filled with CO2. The DIAL wavelengths of 287 and 299 nm are generated as the second and third Stokes lines resulting from stimulated Raman scattering of the cell pumped using the fourth harmonic of a Nd: YAG laser (266 nm). The aerosol lidar transmits three wavelengths simultaneously (355, 532 and 1064 nm) employing a detector designed to measure the three backscatter channels, two nitrogen Raman channels (387 and 607 nm) and one cross-polarization channel at 355 nm. In addition, we added a water vapor channel arising from the Raman-shifted 355 nm output (407 nm) to provide nighttime water vapor profiles. AMOLITE participated in a validation experiment alongside four other ozone DIAL systems before being deployed to the ECCC Oski-otin ground site in the Alberta oil sands region in November 2016. Ozone was found to increase throughout the troposphere by as much as a factor of 2 from stratospheric intrusions. The dry stratospheric air within the intrusion was measured to be less than 0.2 g kg(-1). A biomass burning event that impacted the region over an 8-day period produced lidar ratios of 35 to 65 sr at 355 nm and 40 to 100 sr at 532. Over the same period the Angstrom exponent decreased from 1.56 +/- 0.2 to 1.35 +/- 0.2 in the 2-4 km smoke region.

Whether threats are part of a continuum of aggressive behaviors or separately controlled remains unclear. We analyze threats in Drosophila and show they are triggered by male cues and visual motion, and comprised of multiple motor elements that can be flexibly combined. We isolate a cluster of similar to 3 neurons whose activity is necessary for threat displays but not for other aggressive behaviors, and whose artificial activation suffices to evoke naturalistic threats in solitary flies, suggesting that the neural control of threats is modular with respect to other aggressive behaviors. Artificially evoked threats suffice to repel opponents from a resource in the absence of contact aggression. Depending on its level of artificial activation, this neural threat module can evoke different motor elements in a threshold-dependent manner. Such scalable modules may represent fundamental "building blocks'' of neural circuits that mediate complex multi-motor behaviors.

Reevaluating growing season length controls on net ecosystem production in evergreen conifer forests	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BLACK SPRUCE FOREST; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOLOGY; TEMPERATE; EXCHANGE; CYCLE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; VARIABILITY	Growing season length (GSL) is a key unifying concept in ecology that can be estimated from eddy covariance-derived estimates of net ecosystem production (NEP). Previous studies disagree on how increasing GSLs may affect NEP in evergreen coniferous forests, potentially due to the variety of methods used to quantify GSL from NEP. We calculated GSL and GSL-NEP regressions at eleven evergreen conifer sites across a broad climatic gradient in western North America using three common approaches: (1) variable length (3-7 days) regressions of day of year versus NEP, (2) a smoothed threshold approach, and (3) the carbon uptake period, followed by a new approach of a method-averaged ensemble. The GSL and the GSL-NEP relationship differed among methods, resulting in linear relationships with variable sign, slope, and statistical significance. For all combinations of sites and methods, the GSL explained between 6% and 82% of NEP with p-values ranging from 0.45 to < 0.01. These results demonstrate the variability among GSL methods and the importance of selecting an appropriate method to accurately project the ecosystem carbon cycling response to longer growing seasons in the future. To encourage this approach in future studies, we outline a series of best practices for GSL method selection depending on research goals and the annual NEP dynamics of the study site(s). These results contribute to understanding growing season dynamics at ecosystem and continental scales and underscore the potential for methodological variability to influence forecasts of the evergreen conifer forest response to climate variability.

Here, we introduce a flexible tape-based superhydrophilic superhydrophobic tape toward on-site heavy metals monitoring. On such a superwettable tape, capillarity-assisted superhydrophilic microwells allow directly anchoring indicators in fixed locations and sampling into a test zone via simple dip-pull from an origin specimen solution. In contrast, the superhydrophobic substrate could confine the microdroplets in the superhydrophilic microwells for reducing the amount of analytical solution. The tape-based microchip also displays excellent flexibility against stretching, bending, and torquing for expanding wearable and portable sensing devices. Qualitative and quantitative colorimetric assessments of multiplex heavy metal analyses (chromium, copper, and nickel) by the naked eye are also achieved. The superwettable tape-based platforms with a facile operation mode and accessible signal read-out represent unrevealed potential for on-site environmental monitoring.

By tracking the glucose-induced shift in the surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) emission of mercaptophenylboronic acid (MPBA), we have demonstrated fast and continuous glucose sensing in the physiologically relevant range from 0.1 to 30 mM and verified the underlying mechanism using numerical simulations. Bonding of glucose to MPBA suppresses the "breathing" mode of MPBA at 1071 cm(-1) and energizes the constrained bending mode at 1084 cm(-1), causing the dominant peak to shift from 1071 to 1084 cm(-1). MPBA glucose bonding is also reversible, allowing continuous tracking of ambient glucose concentrations, and the MPBA-coated substrates showed very stable performance over a 30 day period, making the approach promising for long-term continuous glucose monitoring. Using Raman-mode-constrained, miniaturized SERS implants, we also successfully demonstrated intraocular glucose measurements in six ex vivo rabbit eyes within +/- 0.5 mM of readings obtained using a commercial glucose sensor.

Spitzer Planck Herschel Infrared Cluster (SPHerIC) survey: Candidate galaxy clusters at 1.3 < z < 3 selected by high star-formation rate	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; submillimeter: galaxies; infrared: galaxies; galaxies: star formation	COLOR-MAGNITUDE RELATION; FORMATION-DENSITY RELATION; STELLAR MASS; SPACE; PROTOCLUSTERS; EVOLUTION; SOUTH; ENVIRONMENT; REVERSAL; CHANDRA	There is a lack of large samples of spectroscopically confirmed clusters and protoclusters at high redshifts, z > 1.5. Discovering and characterizing distant (proto-) clusters is important for yielding insights into the formation of large-scale structure and on the physical processes responsible for regulating star-formation in galaxies in dense environments. The Spitzer Planck Herschel Infrared Cluster (SPHerIC) survey was initiated to identify these characteristically faint and dust-reddened sources during the epoch of their early assembly. We present Spitzer/IRAC observations of 82 galaxy (proto-) cluster candidates at 1.3 < z(p) < 3.0 that were vetted in a two step process: (1) using Planck to select by color those sources with the highest star-formation rates, and (2) using Herschel at higher resolution to separate out the individual red sources. The addition of the Spitzer data enables efficient detection of the central and massive brightest red cluster galaxies (BRCGs). We find that BRCGs are associated with highly significant, extended and crowded regions of IRAC sources which are more overdense than the field. This result corroborates our hypothesis that BRCGs within the Planck-Herschel sources trace some of the densest and actively star-forming proto-clusters in the early Universe. On the basis of a richness-mass proxy relation, we obtain an estimate of their mean masses which suggests our sample consists of some of the most massive clusters at z approximate to 2 and are the likely progenitors of the most massive clusters observed today.

Representing sub-grid scale variations in nitrogen deposition associated with land use in a global Earth system model: implications for present and future nitrogen deposition fluxes over North America	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							GASEOUS DRY DEPOSITION; BIOSPHERE-ATMOSPHERE EXCHANGE; AMMONIA EMISSIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; SURFACE-RESISTANCE; REACTIVE NITROGEN; PLANT DIVERSITY; WET DEPOSITION	Reactive nitrogen (N) emissions have increased over the last 150 years as a result of greater fossil fuel combustion and food production. The resulting increase in N deposition can alter the function of ecosystems, but characterizing its ecological impacts remains challenging, in part because of uncertainties in model-based estimates of N dry deposition. Here, we use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) atmospheric chemistry-climate model (AM3) coupled with the GFDL land model (LM3) to estimate dry deposition velocities. We leverage the tiled structure of LM3 to represent the impact of physical, hydrological, and ecological heterogeneities on the surface removal of chemical tracers. We show that this framework can be used to estimate N deposition at more ecologically relevant scales (e.g., natural vegetation, water bodies) than from the coarse-resolution global model AM3. Focusing on North America, we show that the faster removal of N over forested ecosystems relative to cropland and pasture implies that coarse-resolution estimates of N deposition from global models systematically underestimate N deposition to natural vegetation by 10% to 30% in the central and eastern US. Neglecting the sub-grid scale heterogeneity of dry deposition velocities also results in an underestimate (overestimate) of the amount of reduced (oxidized) nitrogen deposited to water bodies. Overall, changes in land cover associated with human activities are found to slow down the removal of N from the atmosphere, causing a reduction in the dry oxidized, dry reduced, and total (wet+dry) N deposition over the contiguous US of 8 %, 26 %, and 6 %, respectively. We also find that the reduction in the overall rate of removal of N associated with land-use change tends to increase N deposition on the remaining natural vegetation and facilitate N export to Canada. We show that sub-grid scale differences in the surface removal of oxidized and reduced nitrogen imply that projected near-term (2010-2050) changes in oxidized (-47 %) and reduced (+40 %) US N emissions will cause opposite changes in N deposition to water bodies (increase) and natural vegetation (decrease) in the eastern US, with potential implications for acidification and ecosystems.

Yet how multidimensional mesenchymal cell movements are coordinated remains mostly unknown. Here we report that coordinated mesenchymal cell migration during chicken feather elongation is accompanied by dynamic changes of bioelectric currents. Transcriptome profiling and functional assays implicate contributions from functional voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), Connexin-43 based gap junctions, and Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. 4-Dimensional Ca2+ imaging reveals that the Sonic hedgehog-responsive mesenchymal cells display synchronized Ca2+ oscillations, which expand progressively in area during feather elongation. Inhibiting VGCCs, gap junctions, or Sonic hedgehog signaling alters the mesenchymal Ca2+ landscape, cell movement patterns and feather bud elongation. Ca2+ oscillations induced by cyclic activation of opto-cCRAC channels enhance feather bud elongation. Functional disruption experiments and promoter analysis implicate synergistic Hedgehog and WNT/beta-Catenin signaling in activating Connexin-43 expression, establishing gap junction networks synchronizing the Ca2+ profile among cells, thereby coordinating cell movement patterns.
