J	Savard, B; Bobbitt, B; Blanquart, G				Savard, Bruno; Bobbitt, Brock; Blanquart, Guillaume			Structure of a high Karlovitz n-C7H16 premixed turbulent flame	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Premixed turbulent flame; Detailed finite-rate chemistry; Differential diffusion; Direct numerical simulation; Heptane	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DENSITY; HEAT	Results from a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a high Karlovitz, slightly lean (phi = 0.9), n-C7H16/air premixed turbulent flame are presented. The flame is statistically flat and is subjected to an inflow of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. A 35-species and 217-reaction mechanism (Bisetti et al., 2012) [17] is used to represent the chemistry. Two simulations have been performed: one with unity Lewis number to asses the effects of turbulence on the flame structure in the absence of differential diffusion, and the other with non-unity Lewis numbers to analyze how turbulence affects differential diffusion. The Karlovitz numbers are 280 and 220 respectively. The first simulation reveals that the flame is strongly affected by turbulence as enhanced mixing largely thickens the preheat zone. However, the turbulent flame structure (i.e. the correlation between species and temperature) is similar to that of a one-dimensional flat flame, suggesting that turbulence has limited effet on the flame in temperature space, in the absence of differential diffusion. In the second simulation, the flame structure is affected by turbulence, as differential diffusion effects are weakened. It is suggested that this result is attributed to the fact that turbulence drives the effective species Lewis numbers towards unity through an increase in effective species and thermal diffusivities. Finally, the reaction zones of both the unity and the non-unity Lewis number turbulent flames remain thin, and are locally broken (only to some extent for the unity Lewis number flame, and more strongly for non-unity).

J	Borghesi, G; Bellan, J				Borghesi, Giulio; Bellan, Josette			Irreversible entropy production rate in high-pressure turbulent reactive flows	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						High-pressure turbulent reacting flow; Direct Numerical Simulation	DIRECT NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; AUTOIGNITION; FLAMES	A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database is created describing high-pressure reactive flows for studying the flow characteristics and the irreversible entropy production rate that must be modeled by Subgrid-Scale (SGS) models in Large Eddy Simulation. The governing equations are the continuity, momentum, total energy and species transport equations complemented by a real-gas equation of state. The molecular transport model is based on complete mass-diffusion and thermal-diffusion matrices having elements computed according to all-pressure mixing rules. The mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity are calculated from the individual species values, valid at high pressures, by using all-pressure mixing rules. The reaction is a one-step process and the values of different coefficients in the reaction rate ensure that it gives physically-correct trends for autoignition. The DNS is performed for a temporal mixing layer. Three realizations are computed and examined to reveal the influence of the initial pressure p(0) and of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). It is found that the main flame is of diffusion type, flanked by premixed flames. As p(0) increases, the most intensive premixed-flame regions draw closer to the diffusion flame. Additionally to the well-known advantage of EGR, we found that it promotes the development of uphill diffusion which is a molecular process inducing the formation of strong species gradients that in turn induce turbulence production, i.e. the formation of dynamic small scales. Analysis of the irreversible entropy production rate revealed that its four modes - due to viscosity, mass diffusivity, thermal conductivity and reaction - operate in different spatial regions of the flow where different phenomena occur. Increasing p(0) and lack of EGR both result in an increase in the magnitude of the irreversible entropy-production rate. For the Reynolds number values achievable in DNS, the reaction mode dominates in magnitude all other modes of the irreversible entropy-production rate. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Effects of aromatic chemistry-turbulence interactions on soot formation in a turbulent non-premixed flame	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Large eddy simulation; Soot; Turbulent non-premixed flames; Chemistry-turbulence interactions	LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; SUBGRID-SCALE MODEL; DISSIPATION RATE; PREDICTION; EVOLUTION; TRANSPORT; SCHEME	In this paper, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) have been performed on an ethylene/air piloted turbulent non-premixed sooting jet flame to quantify the importance of aromatic chemistry-turbulence interactions. Aromatic species are of primary importance since their concentrations control directly the soot nucleation rates. In the current work, the chemistry-turbulence interactions for benzene and naphthalene are taken into account by solving transport equations for their mass fractions. A recently developed relaxation model is used to provide closure for their chemical source terms. The effects of turbulent unsteadiness on soot yield and distribution are highlighted by comparing the LES results with a separate LES using tabulated chemistry for all species including the aromatic species. Results from both simulations are compared to experimental measurements. Overall, it is shown that turbulent unsteady effects are of critical importance for the accurate prediction of not only the inception locations, but also the magnitude and fluctuations of soot.

Constraints on Asian ozone using Aura TES, OMI and Terra MOPITT	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPOSPHERIC NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; TRANSPACIFIC TRANSPORT; SATELLITE INSTRUMENT; REACTIVE NITROGEN; CO CORRELATIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; SURFACE OZONE; GEOS-CHEM	Rapid industrialization in Asia in the last two decades has resulted in a significant increase in Asian ozone (O-3/precursor emissions with likely a corresponding increase in the export of O-3 and its precursors. However, the relationship between this increasing O-3, the chemical environment, O-3 production efficiency, and the partitioning between anthropogenic and natural precursors is unclear. In this work, we use satellite measurements of O-3, CO and NO2 from TES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer), MO-PITT (Measurement of Pollution In The Troposphere) and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) to quantify O-3 precursor emissions for 2006 and their impact on free tropospheric O-3 over northeastern Asia, where pollution is typically exported globally due to strong westerlies. Using the GEOS-Chem (Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry) global chemical transport model, we test the modeled seasonal and interannual variation of O-3 based on prior and updated O-3 precursor emissions where the updated emissions of CO and NOx are based on satellite measurements of CO and NO2. We show that the observed TES O-3 variability and amount are consistent with the model for these updated emissions. However, there is little difference in the modeled ozone between the updated and prior emissions. For example, for the 2006 June time period, the prior and posterior NOx emissions were 14% different over China but the modeled ozone in the free troposphere was only 2.5% different. Using the ad-joint of GEOS-Chem we partition the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic sources to free troposphere O-3 in this region. We find that the influence of lightning NOx in the summer is comparable to the contribution from surface emissions but smaller for other seasons. China is the primary contributor of anthropogenic CO, emissions and their export during the summer. While the posterior CO emissions improved the comparison between model and TES by 32%, on average, this change also had only a small effect on the free tropospheric ozone. Our results show that the influence of India and southeastern Asia emissions on O-3 pollution export to the northwestern Pacific is sizeable, comparable with Chinese emissions in winter, about 50% of Chinese emissions in spring and fall, and approximately 20% of the emissions in the summer.

J	Ganbavale, G; Zuend, A; Marcolli, C; Peter, T				Ganbavale, G.; Zuend, A.; Marcolli, C.; Peter, T.			Improved AIOMFAC model parameterisation of the temperature dependence of activity coefficients for aqueous organic mixtures	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							VAPOR-LIQUID-EQUILIBRIA; HOMOGENEOUS ICE NUCLEATION; PLUS ACETIC-ACID; CONSTITUENT BINARY-SYSTEMS; UNIFAC GROUP-CONTRIBUTION; ETHYL-ACETATE-ACETONE; TERT-BUTYL ALCOHOL; PHASE-EQUILIBRIA; SOLID-LIQUID; TERNARY-SYSTEMS	This study presents a new, improved parameterisation of the temperature dependence of activity coefficients in the AIOMFAC (Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients) model applicable for aqueous as well as water-free organic solutions. For electrolyte-free organic and organic-water mixtures the AIOMFAC model uses a group-contribution approach based on UNIFAC (UNIversal quasi-chemical Functional-group Activity Coefficients). This group-contribution approach explicitly accounts for interactions among organic functional groups and between organic functional groups and water. The previous AIOMFAC version uses a simple parameterisation of the temperature dependence of activity coefficients, aimed to be applicable in the temperature range from similar to 275 to similar to 400 K. With the goal to improve the description of a wide variety of organic compounds found in atmospheric aerosols, we extend the AIOMFAC parameterisation for the functional groups carboxyl, hydroxyl, ketone, aldehyde, ether, ester, alkyl, aromatic carbon-alcohol, and aromatic hydrocarbon to atmospherically relevant low temperatures. To this end we introduce a new parameterisation for the temperature dependence. The improved temperature dependence parameterisation is derived from classical thermodynamic theory by describing effects from changes in molar enthalpy and heat capacity of a multi-component system. Thermodynamic equilibrium data of aqueous organic and water-free organic mixtures from the literature are carefully assessed and complemented with new measurements to establish a comprehensive database, covering a wide temperature range (similar to 190 to similar to 440 K) for many of the functional group com-binations considered. Different experimental data types and their processing for the estimation of AIOMFAC model parameters are discussed. The new AIOMFAC parameterisation for the temperature dependence of activity coefficients from low to high temperatures shows an overall improvement of 28% in comparison to the previous model version, when both versions are compared to our database of experimentally determined activity coefficients and related thermodynamic data. When comparing the previous and new AIOMFAC model parameterisations to the subsets of experimental data with all temperatures below 274 K or all temperatures above 322 K (i.e. outside a 25 K margin of the reference temperature of 298 K), applying the new parameterisation leads to 37% improvement in each of the two temperature ranges considered. The new parameterisation of AIOMFAC agrees well with a large number of experimental data sets. Larger model-measurement discrepancies were found particularly for some of the systems containing multi-functional organic compounds. The affected systems were typically also poorly represented at room temperature and further improvements will be necessary to achieve better performance of AIOMFAC in these cases (assuming the experimental data are reliable). The performance of the AIOMFAC parameterisation is typically better for systems containing relatively small organic compounds and larger deviations may occur in mixtures where molecules of high structural complexity such as highly oxygenated compounds or molecules of high molecular mass (e.g. oligomers) prevail. Nevertheless, the new parameterisation enables the calculation of activity coefficients for a wide variety of different aqueous/water-free organic solutions down to the low temperatures present in the upper troposphere.

Johnson Noise Thermometry (JNT) is employed as a readout technique. In contrast to its superconducting Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) counterpart, the normal-metal nano-HEB can operate at any cryogenic temperature depending on the required radiation background limited Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). It does not require bias lines; 100s of nano-HEBs can be read by a single low-noise X-band amplifier via a filter bank channelizer. The modeling predicts that even with the sensitivity penalty due to the amplifier noise, an NEP similar to 10(-20)-10(-19)W/Hz(1/2) can be expected at 50-100 mK in 10-20 nm thin titanium (Ti) normal metal HEBs with niobium (Nb) contacts. This NEP is fairly constant over a range of readout frequencies similar to 10 GHz. Although materials with weaker electron-phonon coupling (bismuth, graphene) do not improve the minimum achievable NEP, they can be considered if a larger than 10 GHz readout bandwidth is required.

Two Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II (ECCO2), solutions were analyzed: one with data assimilation and one without. Assimilated data included satellite observations of sea surface temperature and ocean surface topography, in which the sampling patterns were approximately uniform over the 5 years, and in situ measurements of subsurface salinity and temperature profiles, in which the sampling patterns varied considerably in space and time throughout the 5 years. Velocity measurements were not assimilated. The impact of data assimilation was considered significant when the difference between the transports computed with and without data assimilation was greater than 5.5 X 10(6) m(3) s(-1) (or 5.5 Sv; 1 Sv equivalent to 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) for the EUC and greater than 5.0 Sv for the NECC. In addition, the difference of annual-mean transports computed from 3-day-averaged data was statistically significant at the 95% level. The impact of data assimilation ranged from no impact to very substantial impact when data assimilation increased the EUC transport and decreased the NECC transport. The study's EUC results had some correspondence with other studies and no simple agreement or disagreement pattern emerged among all studies of the impact of data assimilation. No comparable study of the impact of data assimilation on the NECC has been made.

J	Ubelmann, C; Klein, P; Fu, LL				Ubelmann, Clement; Klein, Patrice; Fu, Lee-Lueng			Dynamic Interpolation of Sea Surface Height and Potential Applications for Future High-Resolution Altimetry Mapping	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							COHERENT VORTICES; OCEAN; MESOSCALE; SUBMESOSCALE; TURBULENCE; FLOW; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY; EDDIES; SYSTEM	Many issues may challenge standard interpolation techniques to produce high-resolution gridded maps of sea surface height in the context of future missions like Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT). The present study proposes a new method to address these challenges. Based on the conservation of potential vorticity, the method provides a simple dynamic approach to interpolation through temporal gaps between high spatial resolution observations. For gaps shorter than 20 days, the dynamic interpolation is extremely efficient and allows for the reconstruction of the time evolution of small mesoscale eddies (below 100 km) that would be smoothed out by conventional methods based on optimal mapping. Such a simple approach offers some perspectives for developing high-level products from high-resolution altimetry data in the future.

Analysis of the rotational spectrum of the ground and first torsional excited states of monodeuterated ethane, CH3CH2D	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						Submillimeter; Deuteroethane; Potential barrier	INTERNAL-ROTATION; DEUTERATED ETHANES; POTENTIAL FUNCTION; MOLECULES; BARRIER	The pure rotational spectrum of mono-deuterated ethane, CH3CH2D, has been measured up to 1600 GHz and spectroscopic constants have been fit to 984 transitions in the ground state and 422 transitions in the first torsional excited state (v(18)). Analyses of the ground state data were performed with the programs SPFIT, ERHAM and XIAM and of the first torsional state with SPFIT and ERHAM to extract molecular and spectroscopic constants. A combined fit of both states using ERHAM was used to determine rho = 0.4344026(68), which in the symmetric limit is the ratio I alpha/Iz and a measure of the periodicity of the internal rotation energy with X and the energy differences between the A and E torsional substates, Delta E(E-A), of 74.167(18) and -3382.23(34) MHz for the ground and excited states, respectively. Using these energy differences and the overtone transitions Delta v = 2 from Raman measurements in the literature, the coefficients V-3 and V-6 of the potential function of the internal rotation in CH3CH2D were determined as V-3 = 1004.56(4) cm(-1) and V-6 = 7.09(12) cm(-1). This analysis lays the ground work for the assignment of the IR spectrum of CH3CH2D between (680-880 cm(-1)) which will help quantify isotopic ratios by remote sensing missions.

A central goal is to integrate single-photon detectors to reduce optical losses, latency and wiring complexity associated with off-chip detectors. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are particularly attractive because of high detection efficiency, sub-50-ps jitter and nanosecond-scale reset time. However, while single detectors have been incorporated into individual waveguides, the system detection efficiency of multiple SNSPDs in one photonic circuit-required for scalable quantum photonic circuits-has been limited to <0.2%. Here we introduce a micrometer-scale flip-chip process that enables scalable integration of SNSPDs on a range of photonic circuits. Ten low-jitter detectors are integrated on one circuit with 100% device yield. With an average system detection efficiency beyond 10%, and estimated on-chip detection efficiency of 14-52% for four detectors operated simultaneously, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first on-chip photon correlation measurements of non-classical light.

This system unites the power of formal methods with the accessibility of natural language, providing controllers for implementable high-level task specifications, easy-to-understand feedback on those that cannot be achieved, and natural language explanation of the reason for the robot's actions during execution. The natural language system uses domain-general components that can easily be adapted to cover the vocabulary of new applications. Generation of a linear temporal logic specification from the user's natural language input uses a novel data structure that allows for subsequent mapping of logical propositions back to natural language, enabling natural language feedback about problems with the specification that are only identifiable in the logical form. We demonstrate the robustness of the natural language understanding system through a user study where participants interacted with a simulated robot in a search and rescue scenario. Automated analysis and user feedback on unimplementable specifications is demonstrated using an example involving a robot assistant in a hospital.

In order to establish a chronological framework for global correlation before, during, and following the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction, we carried out a coupled magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic study of two stratigraphic sections in the Upper Devonian carbonate reef complexes of the Lennard Shelf, in the Canning Basin, Western Australia. Magnetostratigraphy from these rocks provides the first high-resolution definition of the Late Devonian magnetic polarity timescale. A 581-m-reference section and an 82-m overlapping section through the marginal slope fades (Napier Formation) of the Oscar Range as well as a 117-m section at Horse Spring (Virgin Hills Formation) were sampled at decimeter to meter scale for magnetostratigraphy. Conodont biostratigraphy was used to correlate both sections, and link magnetostratigraphic polarity zones to a globally established biostratigraphy. A stable, Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) with dual polarities (NE, shallowly upward and SW, shallowly downward) is recovered from similar to 60% of all samples, with magnetite inferred to be the chief magnetic carrier from thermal demagnetization characteristics. These directions define a geomagnetic pole at 49.5 degrees S/285.8 degrees E and alpha(95) = 2.4 (n = 501), placing the Canning Basin at 9.9 degrees S during the Late Devonian, consistent with carbonate reef development at this time. A conservative interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy shows the recovery of multiple reversals from both sections, not including possible cryptochrons and short duration magnetozones. Field tests for primary remanence include positive reversal tests and matching magnetozones from an overlapping section in the Oscar Range. A strong correlation was found between magnetic polarity stratigraphies of the Oscar Range and Horse Spring sections, and we correlate 12 magnetostratigraphic packages. The relative stratigraphic thicknesses of the isochronous sediments from these two sections indicate that carbonate accumulation was similar to 4.5x faster in the middle slope deposits at Oscar Range than in the more distal, lower slope Horse Spring deposits for the middle Frasnian through Famennian. The magnetic field during the Late Devonian underwent a relatively high reversal frequency with good potential for regional and global correlation, and should prove useful in deciphering a high-resolution chronostratigraphy across the Lennard Shelf to enable higher confidence examination of reef development across a major biotic crisis.

An adjoint-based eigenmode decomposition technique is used to project cross-sectional velocity profiles measured using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) on the different families of eigenmodes present in the LST eigenspectrum. Attention is focused on the evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) eigenmode and the projection of experimental fluctuations on it, since in subsonic jets the inflectional K H instability is the only possible mechanism for linear amplification of the large-scale fluctuations, and governs the wavepacket evolution. Comparisons of the fluctuations extracted by projection onto K-H eigenmode with PSE solutions and Ply measurements are made. We show that the jet can be divided into three main regions, classified with respect to the LST eigenspectrum. Near the jet exit, there is significant amplification of the K-H mode; the PSE solution is shown to comprise almost exclusively the K-H mode, and the agreement with experiments shows that the evolution of this mode dominates the near-nozzle fluctuations. For downstream positions, the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode becomes stable and eventually merges with other branches of the eigenspectrum. The comparison between PSE, experiment and the projection onto the K-H mode for downstream positions suggests that the mechanism of saturation and decay of wavepackets is related to a combination of several marginally stable modes, which is reasonably well modeled by linear PSE, but cannot be obtained in the usual application of locally-parallel stability dealing exclusively with the K-H mode. In addition, the projection of empirical data on the K-H eigenmode at a near-nozzle cross-section is shown to be a well-founded method for the determination of the amplitudes of the linear wavepacket models.

When cryogenically cooled to 22 K and measured through a mylar vacuum window, the amplifier module chain achieves a receiver noise temperature of 87 K at 228 GHz and less than a 100 K noise temperature from 217 to 236 GHz. The LNA modules have 21-31 dB gain and the power dissipation is 12.4-15.8 mW. To the best of authors' knowledge, these are the lowest LNA noise temperatures at these frequencies reported to date.

Azimuthal Spoke Propagation in Hall Effect Thrusters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd International Electric Propulsion Conference (IEPC 2013)	OCT 06-10, 2013	George Washington Univ, Washington, DC		George Washington Univ	Aerospace industry; hall effect devices; plasma diagnostics; plasma measurements; plasma waves; satellites; space technology	STATIONARY PLASMA THRUSTERS	Spokes are azimuthally propagating perturbations in the plasma discharge of Hall effect thrusters (HETs) that travel in the E x B direction. The mechanisms for spoke formation are unknown, but their presence has been associated with improved thruster performance in some thrusters motivating a detailed investigation. The propagation of azimuthal spokes are investigated in a 6 kW HET by using high-speed imaging and azimuthally spaced probes. The spoke velocity is determined from high-speed image analysis using three methods with similar results. The spoke velocity for three discharge voltages (300, 400, and 450 V) and three anode mass flow rates (14.7, 19.5, and 25.2 mg/s) are between 1500 and 2200 m/s across a range of magnetic field settings. The spoke velocity is inversely dependent on magnetic field strength for lower B-fields and asymptotes at higher B-fields. Spoke velocities calculated from the probes are consistently higher by 30% or more. An empirically approximated dispersion relation of omega(alpha) = nu(alpha)(ch)k(theta)(alpha) - omega(alpha)(ch) where alpha >= 1 yields a characteristic velocity that matches the ion acoustic speed for similar to 5 eV electrons which exist in the near-anode and near-field plume regions of the discharge.

Results for a variety of plasma properties are presented and compared with laboratory measurements. The large size of the device permits peak electron number densities in the cathode interior that are lower than those established in the NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) hollow cathode, which operates at a 7.3x lower discharge current and 3.2x lower mass flow rate. The maximum electron current density also is lower in the LaB6 cathode, by 4.2x, due to the larger orifice size. Simulations and direct measurements show that at 12 sccm of xenon flow the peak emitter temperature is in the range of 1630 degrees C-1666 degrees C. It is also found that the conditions for the excitement of current-driven streaming instabilities and ion-acoustic turbulence (IAT) are satisfied in this cathode, similarly to what was found in the past in its smaller counterparts like the NSTAR cathode. Based on numerical simulations, it has long been argued that these instabilities may be responsible for the anomalously large ion energies that have been measured in these discharges as well as for the enhancement of the plasma resistivity. Direct measurements of the turbulent spectra and confirmation of the presence of IAT in this cathode have now been completed. Interpolation of the measured anomalous collision frequency based on slightly different operating conditions than the one in the numerical simulations suggests good agreement with the computed values.

J	Liu, JJ; Schneider, T				Liu, Junjun; Schneider, Tapio			Scaling of Off-Equatorial Jets in Giant Planet Atmospheres	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Atmospheric circulation; Dynamics; Large-scale motions; Momentum; Planetary atmospheres; Turbulence	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; ZONAL WINDS; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BAROCLINIC INSTABILITY; GRAVITATIONAL SIGNALS; JUPITERS ATMOSPHERE; BETA-PLANE; CASSINI; TURBULENCE; EDDIES	In the off-equatorial region of Jupiter's and Saturn's atmospheres, baroclinic eddies transport angular momentum out of retrograde and into prograde jets. In a statistically steady state, this angular momentum transfer by eddies must be balanced by dissipation, likely produced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drag in the planetary interior. This paper examines systematically how an idealized representation of this drag in a general circulation model (GCM) of the upper atmosphere of giant planets modifies jet characteristics, the angular momentum budget, and the energy budget.In the GCM, Rayleigh drag at an artificial lower boundary (with mean pressure of 3 bar) is used as a simple representation of the MHD drag that the flow on giant planets experiences at depth. As the drag coefficient decreases, the eddy length scale and eddy kinetic energy increase, as they do in studies of two-dimensional turbulence. Off-equatorial jets become wider and stronger, with increased interjet spacing. Coherent vortices also become more prevalent. Generally, the jet width scales with the Rhines scale, which is of similar magnitude as the Rossby radius in the simulations. The jet strength increases primarily through strengthening of the barotropic component, which increases as the drag coefficient decreases because the overall kinetic energy dissipation remains roughly constant. The overall kinetic energy dissipation remains roughly constant presumably because it is controlled by baroclinic conversion of potential to kinetic energy in the upper troposphere, which is mainly determined by the differential solar radiation and is only weakly dependent on bottom drag and barotropic flow variations.For Jupiter and Saturn, these results suggest that the wider and stronger jets on Saturn may arise because the MHD drag on Saturn is weaker than on Jupiter, while the thermodynamic efficiencies of the atmospheres are not sensitive to the drag parameters.

On the characterization of vegetation transmissivity using LAI for application in passive microwave remote sensing of snowpack	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Remote sensing of snow; Passive microwave radiometry; Vegetation transmissivity; Scaling	NIMBUS-7 SMMR DATA; LEAF-AREA INDEX; WATER EQUIVALENT; MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; FOREST; EMISSION; RETRIEVAL; COVER; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY	Vegetation has long been an obstacle in efforts to derive snow depth and mass estimates from passive microwave (PM) measurements of brightness temperature (T-b). Though certain metrics have been derived in an effort to characterize the effects of vegetation, some are restricted to certain vegetation types, while others are difficult to measure over the large scales at which spacebome PM measurements are made. In this study, we examine PM measurements made at multiple observation scales in Colorado and Wyoming, and found that spatial variations of airborne T-b data and temporal variation of spacebome T-b data are both highly correlated with a globally available remotely-sensed vegetation dataset, specifically the Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. The effective vegetation transmissivity, a physical variable used in existing simple radiative transfer models, is derived from a conservative assumption based on the variability in the measured T-b. We validate our transmissivity estimates over multiple snow seasons and geographic domains. Lastly, based on the variability in the measured T-b with respect to LAI, we define microwave-retrievable areas for PM-based retrieval methods of snow water equivalent (SWE). Over the spatial domain used in this study, over 96% of the area is microwave retrievable at airborne microwave resolutions, which corresponds to 865% of the total SWE. Alternatively at spacebome PM resolution, 52.8% of the land area and 35.5% of the SWE are microwave retrievable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ASTROMETRY OF PLUTO FROM 1930-1951 OBSERVATIONS: THE LAMPLAND PLATE COLLECTION	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						astrometry; ephemerides; Kuiper belt objects: individual (Pluto); planets and satellites: individual (Pluto)	CATALOG; EPHEMERIDES; DASCH; EPM	We present a new analysis of 843 photographic plates of Pluto taken by Carl Lampland at Lowell Observatory from 1930-1951. This large collection of plates contains useful astrometric information that improves our knowledge of Pluto's orbit. This improvement provides critical support to the impending flyby of Pluto by New Horizons. New Horizons can do inbound navigation of the system to improve its targeting. This navigation is capable of nearly eliminating the sky-plane errors but can do little to constrain the time of closest approach. Thus the focus on this work was to better determine Pluto's heliocentric distance and to determine the uncertainty on that distance with a particular eye to eliminating systematic errors that might have been previously unrecognized. This work adds 596 new astrometric measurements based on the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog 4. With the addition of these data the uncertainty of the estimated heliocentric position of Pluto in Developmental Ephemerides 432 (DE432) is at the level of 1000 km. This new analysis gives us more confidence that these estimations are accurate and are sufficient to support a successful flyby of Pluto by New Horizons.

These short-duration pulses can be produced by known objects such as pulsars or potentially by more exotic objects such as evaporating black holes. The identification and verification of such an event would be of great scientific value. This is one major goal of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) Fast Transient Experiment (V-FASTR), a software-based detection system installed at the VLBA. V-FASTR uses a "commensal" (piggy-back) approach, analyzing all array data continually during routine VLBA observations and identifying candidate fast transient events. Raw data can be stored from a buffer memory, which enables a comprehensive off-line analysis. This is invaluable for validating the astrophysical origin of any detection. Candidates discovered by the automatic system must be reviewed each day by analysts to identify any promising signals that warrant a more in-depth investigation. To support the timely analysis of fast transient detection candidates by V-FASTR scientists, we have developed a metadata-driven, collaborative candidate review framework. The framework consists of a software pipeline for metadata processing composed of both open source software components and project-specific code written expressly to extract and catalog metadata from the incoming V-FASTR data products, and a web-based data portal that facilitates browsing and inspection of the available metadata for candidate events extracted from the VLBA radio data.

This paper presents recent results from a continuing program of high-precision astrometric very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn, using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We have previously shown that VLBA measurements can be combined with spacecraft orbit determinations from Doppler and range tracking and VLBI links to the inertial extragalactic reference frame to provide the most accurate barycentric positions currently available for Saturn. Here we report an additional five years of VLBA observations along with improved phase reference source positions, resulting in an improvement in residuals with respect to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's dynamical ephemeris.

GPI is designed to image and provide low-resolution spectra of Jupiter-sized, self-luminous planetary companions around young nearby stars. These observations were taken covering the H band (1.65 mu m). The spectrum has a resolving power of similar to 45 and demonstrates the distinctive triangular shape of a cool substellar object with low surface gravity. Using atmospheric models, we find an effective temperature of 1600-1700K and a surface gravity of log(g) = 3.5-4.5 (cgs units). These values agree well with "hot-start" predictions from planetary evolution models for a gas giant with mass between 10 and 12 M-Jup and age between 10 and 20 Myr.

AN ALMA DISK MASS FOR THE CANDIDATE PROTOPLANETARY COMPANION TO FW TAU	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						planets and satellites: formation; planets and satellites: general; protoplanetary disks	BROWN DWARF DISKS; SUB-STELLAR COMPANION; ON CIRCUMSTELLAR DISK; VERY-LOW MASS; BINARY-SYSTEMS; UPPER SCORPIUS; WIDE ORBITS; PLANET FORMATION; GIANT PLANETS; STARS	We present ALMA observations of the FW Tau system, a close binary pair of M5 stars with a wide-orbit (300 AU projected separation) substellar companion. The companion is extremely faint and red in the optical and near-infrared, but boasts a weak far-infrared excess and optical/near-infrared emission lines indicative of a primordial accretion disk of gas and dust. The component-resolved 1.3mm continuum emission is found to be associated only with the companion, with a flux (1.78 +/- 0.03 mJy) that indicates a dust mass of 1-2M(circle plus). While this mass reservoir is insufficient to form a giant planet, it is more than sufficient to produce an analog of the Kepler-42 exoplanetary system or the Galilean satellites. The mass and geometry of the disk-bearing FW Tau companion remains unclear. Near-infrared spectroscopy shows deep water bands that indicate a spectral type later than M5, but substantial veiling prevents a more accurate determination of the effective temperature (and hence mass). Both a disk-bearing "planetary-mass" companion seen in direct light or a brown dwarf tertiary viewed in light scattered by an edge-on disk or envelope remain possibilities.

These were the only two galaxies found via optical imaging and spectroscopy of 22 Hi clouds identified in the GALFA-H I survey as dwarf galaxy candidates. They have properties consistent with being in the Local Volume (<10 Mpc), and one has resolved stellar populations such that it may be on the outer edge of the Local Group (similar to 1 Mpc from M31). While the distance uncertainty makes interpretation ambiguous, these may be among the faintest star-forming galaxies known. Additionally, rough estimates comparing these galaxies to Lambda CDM dark matter simulations suggest consistency in number density, implying that the dark matter halos likely to host these galaxies are primarily Hi-rich. The galaxies may thus be indicative of a large population of dwarfs at the limit of detectability that are comparable to the faint satellites of the Local Group. Because they are outside the influence of a large dark matter halo to alter their evolution, these galaxies can provide critical anchors to dwarf galaxy formation models.

This challenge can be overcome by exploiting the time-reversal property of optical phase conjugation (OPC) to reverse multiple scattering events or suppress turbidity. However, in living tissue, scatterers are highly movable and the movement can disrupt time-reversal symmetry when there is a latency in the OPC playback. In this paper, we show that the motioninduced degradation of the OPC turbidity-suppression effect through a dynamic scattering medium shares the same decorrelation time constant as that determined from speckle intensity autocorrelation -a popular conventional measure of scatterer movement. We investigated this decorrelation characteristic time through a 1.5-mm-thick dorsal skin flap of a living mouse and found that it ranges from 50 ms to 2.5 s depending on the level of immobilization. This study provides information on relevant time scales for applying OPC to living tissues.

Frustration Free Gapless Hamiltonians for Matrix Product States	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SPIN CHAINS; QUANTUM	For every matrix product state (MPS) one can always construct a so-called parent Hamiltonian. This is a local, frustration free, Hamiltonian which has the MPS as ground state and is gapped. Whenever that parent Hamiltonian has a degenerate ground state space (the so-called non-injective case), we construct another 'uncle' Hamiltonian which is also local and frustration free, has the same ground state space, but is gapless, and its spectrum is . The construction is obtained by linearly perturbing the matrices building up the state in a random direction, and then taking the limit where the perturbation goes to zero. For MPS where the parent Hamiltonian has a unique ground state (the so-called injective case) we also build such uncle Hamiltonian with the same properties in the thermodynamic limit.

The presentation is in one space dimension, but the framework is general so that the model may be extended to higher dimensions. The model is used to study recent experiments on the alpha double left right arrow epsilon martensitic phase transformation of pure iron under dynamic, shear-dominant loading conditions. It is shown that the model fitted to established thermodynamic data and selected experiments is able to reproduce the experimental observations in a wide range of loading rates ranging from quasistatic to 10(4) s(-1) as well as a wide range of phenomena ranging including overall rate hardening and thermal softening. In doing so, the model also provides new insight into the alpha double left right arrow epsilon phase transformation in iron. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the near future, our best chance to look for chemical signatures of a habitable environment (or life itself) will likely be at the inhospitable icy surface. Therefore, it is important to understand the ability of organic signatures of life and life itself to persist under simulated europan surface conditions. Toward that end, this work examined the UV photolysis of Bacillus subtilis spores and their chemical marker dipicolinic acid (DPA) at temperatures and pressures relevant to Europa. In addition, inactivation curves for the spores at 100 K, 100 K covered in one micron of ice, and 298 K were measured to determine the probability for spore survival at the surface. Fourier transform infrared spectra of irradiated DPA showed a loss of carboxyl groups to CO2 as expected but unexpectedly showed significant opening of the heterocyclic ring, even for wavelengths >200 nm. Both DPA and B. subtilis spores showed identical unknown spectral bands of photoproducts after irradiation, further highlighting the importance of DPA in the photochemistry of spores. Spore survival was enhanced at 100 K by similar to 5x relative to 298 K, but 99.9% of spores were still inactivated after the equivalent of similar to 25 h of exposure on the europan surface.

Direct measurement of neon production rates by (alpha,n) reactions in minerals	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article							HELIUM DIFFUSION KINETICS; RADIATION-DAMAGE; SILICATE-GLASSES; HE-4 DIFFUSION; (U-TH)/HE; APATITE; DURANGO; SYSTEMATICS; SOLUBILITY; ISOTOPES	The production of nucleogenic neon from alpha particle capture by O-18 and F-19 offers a potential chronometer sensitive to temperatures higher than the more widely used (U-Th)/He chronometer. The accuracy depends on the cross sections and the calculated stopping power for alpha particles in the mineral being studied. Published O-18(alpha,n)Ne-21 production rates are in poor agreement and were calculated from contradictory cross sections, and therefore demand experimental verification. Similarly, the stopping powers for alpha particles are calculated from SRIM (Stopping Range of Ions in Matter software) based on a limited experimental dataset. To address these issues we used a particle accelerator to implant alpha particles at precisely known energies into slabs of synthetic quartz (SiO2) and barium tungstate (BaWO4) to measure Ne-21 production from capture by O-18. Within experimental uncertainties the observed Ne-21 production rates compare favorably to our predictions using published cross sections and stopping powers, indicating that ages calculated using these quantities are accurate at the similar to 3% level. In addition, we measured the Ne-22/Ne-21 ratio and (U-Th)/He and (U-Th)/Ne ages of Durango fluorapatite, which is an important model system for this work because it contains both oxygen and fluorine. Finally, we present Ne-21/He-4 production rate ratios for a variety of minerals of geochemical interest along with software for calculating neon production rates and (U-Th)/Ne ages.

Limiting Light Escape Angle in Silicon Photovoltaics: Ideal and Realistic Cells	IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article						Nanostructures; photovoltaic cells; silicon	SOLAR-CELLS; CRYSTALLINE SILICON; RUGATE FILTER; EFFICIENCY; REASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE	Restricting the light escape angle within a solar cell significantly enhances light trapping, resulting in potentially higher efficiency in thinner cells. Using an improved detailed balance model for silicon and neglecting diffuse light, we calculate an efficiency gain of 3%(abs) for an ideal Si cell of 3-mu m thickness and the escape angle restricted to 2.767 degrees under AM1.5 direct illumination. Applying the model to current high-efficiency cell technologies, we find that a heterojunction-type device with better surface and contact passivation is better suited to escape angle restriction than a homojunction type device. In these more realistic cell models, we also find that there is little benefit gained by restricting the escape angle to less than 10 degrees. The benefits of combining moderate escape angle restriction with low to moderate concentration offers further efficiency gains. Finally, we consider two potential structures for escape angle restriction: a narrowband graded index optical multi-layer and a broadband ray optical structure. The broadband structure, which provides greater angle restriction, allows for higher efficiencies and much thinner cells than the narrowband structure.

In this paper, we explore [n, k, d] systematic error-correcting codes for rank modulation. Such codes have length n, k information symbols, and minimum distance d. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient information retrieval in conjunction with memory-scrubbing schemes. We study systematic codes for rank modulation under Kendall's t-metric as well as under the l(infinity)-metric. In Kendall's tau-metric, we present [k + 2, k, 3] systematic codes for correcting a single error, which have optimal rates, unless systematic perfect codes exist. We also study the design of multierror-correcting codes, and provide a construction of [k + t + 1, k, 2t + 1] systematic codes, for large-enough k. We use nonconstructive arguments to show that for rank modulation, systematic codes achieve the same capacity as general error-correcting codes. Finally, in the l(infinity)-metric, we construct two [n, k, d] systematic multierror-correcting codes, the first for the case of d = O(1) and the second for d = Theta(n). In the latter case, the codes have the same asymptotic rate as the best codes currently known in this metric.

On Match Lengths, Zero Entropy, and Large Deviations-With Application to Sliding Window Lempel-Ziv Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Irrational rotation; zero entropy; entropy dimension; recurrence times; match lengths; sliding window Lempel-Ziv; large deviation property; mixing conditions; entropy estimator; exponential convergence	DATA-COMPRESSION; ASYMPTOTIC PROPERTIES; TIMES; RECURRENCE; REDUNDANCY; VERSION	The sliding window Lempel-Ziv (SWLZ) algorithm that makes use of recurrence times and match lengths has been studied from various perspectives in information theory literature. In this paper, we undertake a finer study of these quantities under two different scenarios: 1) zero entropy sources that are characterized by strong long-term memory and 2) the processes with weak memory as described through various mixing conditions. For zero entropy sources, a general statement on match length is obtained. It is used in the proof of almost sure optimality of fixed shift variant of Lempel-Ziv (FSLZ) and SWLZ algorithms given in literature. Through an example of stationary and ergodic processes generated by an irrational rotation, we establish that for a window of size n(w), a compression ratio given by O(log n(w)/n(w)(a)), where a depends on nw and approaches 1 as n(w) -> infinity, is obtained under the application of FSLZ and SWLZ algorithms. In addition, we give a general expression for the compression ratio for a class of stationary and ergodic processes with zero entropy. Next, we extend the study of Ornstein and Weiss on the asymptotic behavior of the normalized version of recurrence times and establish the large deviation property for a class of mixing processes. In addition, an estimator of entropy based on recurrence times is proposed for which large deviation principle is proved for sources satisfying similar mixing conditions.

Optimal Coding for Streaming Authentication and Interactive Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Data streams; reliable communication; adversarial noise; tree codes; interactive communication; blueberry codes	CODES	We consider the task of communicating a data stream-a long, possibly infinitemessage not known in advance to the sender-over a channel with adversarial noise. For any given noise rate c < 1, we show an efficient, constant-rate scheme that correctly decodes a (1 - c) fraction of the stream sent so far with high probability, or aborts if the noise rate exceeds c. In addition, we prove that no constant-rate scheme can recover more than a (1 - c) fraction of the stream sent so far with non-negligible probability, which makes our scheme optimal in that aspect. The parties are assumed to preshare a random string unknown to the channel. Our techniques can also be applied to the task of interactive communication (two-way communication) over a noisy channel. In a recent paper (Braverman and Rao, STOC11), the possibility of two-party interactive communication as long as the noise level is <1/4 was shown. By allowing the parties to preshare some private random string, we extend this result and construct a (nonefficient) constant-rate interactive protocol that succeeds with overwhelming probability against noise rates up to 1/2. We complete this result by proving that no constant-rate protocol can withstand noise rates >1/2.

By leveraging a recent development on the zero duality gap of OPF, we propose a second-order cone programming convex relaxation of the resistive network OPF, and study the uniqueness of the optimal solution using differential topology, especially the Poincare-Hopf Index Theorem. We characterize the global uniqueness for different network topologies, e.g., line, radial, and mesh networks. This serves as a starting point to design distributed local algorithms with global behaviors that have low complexity, are computationally fast, and can run under synchronous and asynchronous settings in practical power grids.

An intensity study of the torsional bands of ethane at 35 mu m	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						Low temperature ethane; Far infrared; Intensity model; Torsional spectra; Titan; CIRS	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; INTERNAL-ROTATION; PARAMETERS; TEMPERATURE; VIBRATION; SPECTRUM	Ethane is the second most abundant hydrocarbon detected in the outer planets. Although the torsional mode is not infrared active in the lowest order, the strongest feature in this band can be seen near 289 cm(-1) in the CASSINI CIRS spectrum of Titan. Prior laboratory studies have characterized the torsional frequencies to high accuracy and measured the intensities to temperatures as low as 208 K. However, for the interpretation of the far-infrared observations of Titan, further investigation was needed to determine the intensities at lower temperatures and to higher accuracy. The spectrum of C2H6 was investigated from 220 to 330 cm(-1) to obtain the band strengths of the torsional fundamental nu(4) (near 289 cm(-1)) and the first torsional hot band (2 nu(4) - nu(4)). Seven laboratory spectra were obtained at resolutions of 0.01 and 0.02 cm(-1) using a Bruker IFS-125 Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The interferometer was coupled to a coolable multi-pass absorption cell set to an optical path length of 52 m. The range of temperatures was 166-292 K with the lower temperatures being most relevant to the stratosphere of Titan. The ethane sample pressures ranged from 35 to 254 Torr. The modeling of the transition intensities required the expansion of the dipole moment operator to higher order; this introduced Herman-Wallis like terms. The fitting process involved five independent dipole constants and a single self-broadening parameter. The results presented should lead to an improved understanding of the methane cycle in planetary atmospheres and permit other molecular features in the CIRS spectra to be identified.

Electron Cryotomography Studies of Maturing HIV-1 Particles Reveal the Assembly Pathway of the Viral Core	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							MATURATION; DYNAMICS; CLEAVAGE; VIRIONS	To better characterize the assembly of the HIV-1 core, we have used electron cryotomography (ECT) to image infected cells and the viral particles cryopreserved next to them. We observed progressive stages of virus assembly and egress, including flower-like flat Gag lattice assemblies, hemispherical budding profiles, and virus buds linked to the plasma membrane via a thin membrane neck. The population of budded viral particles contains immature, maturation-intermediate, and mature core morphologies. Structural characteristics of the maturation intermediates suggest that the core assembly pathway involves the formation of a CA sheet that associates with the condensed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Our analysis also reveals a correlation between RNP localization within the viral particle and the formation of conical cores, suggesting that the RNP helps drive conical core assembly. Our findings support an assembly pathway for the HIV-1 core that begins with a small CA sheet that associates with the RNP to form the core base, followed by polymerization of the CA sheet along one side of the conical core toward the tip, and then closure around the body of the cone. IMPORTANCE During HIV-1 assembly and release, the Gag polyprotein is organized into a signature hexagonal lattice, termed the immature lattice. To become infectious, the newly budded virus must disassemble the immature lattice by proteolyzing Gag and then reassemble the key proteolytic product, the structural protein p24 (CA), into a distinct, mature hexagonal lattice during a process termed maturation. The mature HIV-1 virus contains a conical capsid that encloses the condensed viral genome at its wide base. Mutations or small molecules that interfere with viral maturation also disrupt viral infectivity. Little is known about the assembly pathway that results in the conical core and genome encapsidation. Here, we have used electron cryotomography to structurally characterize HIV-1 particles that are actively maturing. Based on the morphologies of core assembly intermediates, we propose that CA forms a sheet-like structure that associates with the condensed viral genome to produce the mature infectious conical core.

Structure and spectroscopy of uranyl and thorium complexes with substituted phosphine oxide ligands	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Uranyl; Thorium; Phosphine Oxide; X-ray crystallography; Fluorescence	MOLECULAR-STRUCTURE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SOLVENT-EXTRACTION; NITRATE COMPLEXES; CHEMISTRY; ION	Phosphine oxide ligands are important in the chemistry of the nuclear fuel cycle. We have synthesized and characterized a series of phosphine oxide ligands with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) groups to enhance the spectroscopic features of uranyl, UO22+, and to make detection more efficient. Complexation of OPPh2R, R = C10H7 (naphthyl); C14H9 (phenanthrenyl); C14H9 (anthracenyl); and C16H9 (pyrenyl), to UO2(NO3)(2) afforded the eight-coordinate complexes, UO2(NO3)(2)(OPPh2R)(2). An eleven-coordinate complex, Th(NO3)(4) [OPPh2(C14H9)](3), C14H9 = phenanthrenyl, was structurally characterized, and was found to be the first thorium compound isolated with three phosphine oxide ligands bound. The phosphine oxide ligands were not fluorescent but the anthracenyl-substituted ligand showed broad, red-shifted emission at approximately 50 nm relative to typical anthracene, making this ligand set a possibility for use in detection. The synthesis and spectroscopy of the uranyl and thorium complexes are presented.

Electrochemical surface science twenty years later: Expeditions into the electrocatalysis of reactions at the core of artificial photosynthesis	SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						Electroctrochemical surface science; Artificial photosynthesis; Water-splitting reaction; Carbon dioxide reduction reaction; Electrochemistry-surface science apparatus	HYDROGEN EVOLUTION; NI-MO; WATER-OXIDATION; ALLOY ELECTROCATALYSTS; COBALT-MOLYBDENUM; OXYGEN; MANGANESE; CATHODES; ELECTRODEPOSITION; RESOLUTION	Surface science research fixated on phenomena and processes that transpire at the electrode-electrolyte interface has been pursued in the past A considerable proportion of the earlier work was on materials and reactions pertinent to the operation of small-molecule fuel cells. The experimental approach integrated a handful of surface-sensitive physical-analytical methods with traditional electrochemical techniques, all harbored in a single environment-controlled electrochemistry-surface science apparatus (EC-SSA); the catalyst samples were typically precious noble metals constituted of well-defined single-crystal surfaces. More recently, attention has been diverted from fuel-to-energy generation to its converse, (solar) energy-to-fuel transformation; e.g., instead of water synthesis (from hydrogen and oxygen) in fuel cells, water decomposition (to hydrogen and oxygen) in artificial photosynthesis. The rigorous surface-science protocols remain unchanged but the experimental capabilities have been expanded by the addition of several characterization techniques, either as EC-SSA components or as stand-alone instruments. The present manuscript describes results selected from on-going studies of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the reactions that underpin artificial photosynthesis: nickel-molybdenum alloys for the hydrogen evolution reaction, calcium birnessite as a heterogeneous analogue for the oxygen-evolving complex in natural photosynthesis, and single-crystalline copper in relation to the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.

Direct catalytic conversion of cellulose to liquid straight-chain alkanes	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							HETEROPOLY ACIDS; ETHYLENE-GLYCOL; OXYGENATED HYDROCARBONS; TUNGSTOSILICIC ACIDS; RENEWABLE DIESEL; LEVULINIC ACID; RANGE ALKANES; LACTIC-ACID; BIOMASS; PLATFORM	High yields of liquid straight-chain alkanes were obtained directly from cellulosic feedstock in a one-pot biphasic catalytic system. The catalytic reaction proceeds at elevated temperatures under hydrogen pressure in the presence of tungstosilicic acid, dissolved in the aqueous phase, and modified Ru/C, suspended in the organic phase. Tungstosilicic acid is primarily responsible for cellulose hydrolysis and dehydration steps, while the modified Ru/C selectively hydrogenates intermediates en route to the liquid alkanes. Under optimal conditions, microcrystalline cellulose is converted to 82% n-decane-soluble products, mainly n-hexane, within a few hours, with a minimum formation of gaseous and char products. The dominant route to the liquid alkanes proceeds via 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), whereas the more common pathway via sorbitol appears to be less efficient. High liquid alkane yields were possible through (i) selective conversion of cellulose to glucose and further to HMF by gradually heating the reactor, (ii) a proper hydrothermal modification of commercial Ru/C to tune its chemoselectivity to furan hydrogenation rather than glucose hydrogenation, and (iii) the use of a biphasic reaction system with optimal partitioning of the intermediates and catalytic reactions. The catalytic system is capable of converting subsequent batches of fresh cellulose, enabling accumulation of the liquid alkanes in the organic phase during subsequent runs. Its robustness is illustrated in the conversion of the raw (soft) wood sawdust.

Additionally, microbialites have a demonstrated economic potential to serve as excellent hydrocarbon reservoirs. The Lower Cretaceous Codo Formation, located in the Parnaiba Basin of north-east Brazil, comprises a unique stratigraphic sequence of up to 20m thick, well-preserved carbonate microbialites. Deposited in a continental basin during the initial break up and separation of South America from Africa in the Early Cretaceous, this lacustrine carbonate sequence provides an excellent example to investigate the palaeoenvironmental conditions controlling microbialite facies development. Based on macroscopic and microscopic observations of outcrop and drill core samples, four microbialite facies (stromatolite, lamina, massive and spherulite) were defined and distinguished by textures and microbial fossil content. Changes in facies type are related to alternating palaeo-water depths, as reflected by Sr-87/Sr-86 cycles resulting from fluctuations in the sources of meteoric water. Clumped isotope measurements of stromatolitic fabrics yield precipitation palaeo-temperatures with an average value of 35 degrees C. The O-18 values of bulk carbonate (-68 to -15 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) imply precipitation from water with calculated O-18 values between -16 parts per thousand and 18 parts per thousand Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, reflecting precipitation from variably modified meteoric waters. The C-13 values of bulk carbonate (-155 to -72 parts per thousand Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) indicate a significant input of carbon derived from aerobic or anaerobic respiration of organic matter. Combined, the data indicate that the evolution of the Codo Formation occurred in a closed lacustrine palaeoenvironment with alternating episodes of contracting and expanding lake levels, which led to the development of specific microbialite facies associations. The results provide new insights into palaeoenvironmental settings, biogenicity and early diagenetic processes involved in the formation of ancient carbonate microbialites and, by extension, improve the knowledge of the reservoir geology of correlative units in deep waters offshore Brazil.

Free-flight experiments in LISA Pathfinder	10TH INTERNATIONAL LISA SYMPOSIUM	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International LISA Symposium	MAY 18-23, 2014	Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL	Inst High Energy Phys & Astrophys, Dept Phys, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Off Sponsored Res	Univ Florida		SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SPACED DATA; REALIZATIONS; ALGORITHM	The LISA Path finder mission will demonstrate the technology of drag-free test masses for use as inertial references in future space-based gravitational wave detectors. To accomplish this, the Path finder spacecraft will perform drag-free flight about a test mass while measuring the acceleration of this primary test mass relative to a second reference test mass. Because the reference test mass is contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on it to maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces are a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Path finder system that are not present in the full LISA con figuration. While LISA Path finder has been designed to meet it's primary mission requirements in the presence of this noise, recent estimates suggest that the on-orbit performance may be limited by this 'suspension noise'. The drift-mode or free-flight experiments provide an opportunity to mitigate this noise source and further characterize the underlying disturbances that are of interest to the designers of LISA-like instruments. This article provides a high-level overview of these experiments and the methods under development to analyze the resulting data.

Departing from previous InSAR coherence models, we simultaneously incorporate the interacting effects (on coherence) of (i) "multi-bounce" (wave guidance) within an arbitrary number of dielectric layers, (ii) azimuthal deviation in antenna pointing, (iii) local topography, and (iv) subsurface interface and volume scatter mechanisms. Including multibounce phenomena, in particular, allows better understanding of chief mechanisms behind backscatter enhancement, and the resultant strong corruption of InSAR observables, arising from interrogation of strongly guiding geophysical medium layers. Moreover, modeling the subsurface guidance behavior's influence from terrain topography expands upon many previous InSAR models that assumed simpler terrain and sensor geometries. As the two key results of this paper then, we quantitatively elucidate (i) how guidance behavior in dielectric slabs can engender unbounded, diverging interferometric phase bias, as well as (ii) how terrain sloping can render sub-sections of InSAR coherence images, generated by otherwise terrain-robust sensor geometries, susceptible to guidance-related phase bias and correlation degradation.

It is shown that these filter banks have some important mathematical properties which allow them to reveal localized hidden periodicities in real-time data. These are also compared with traditional comb filters which are sometimes used to identify periodicities. It is shown that non-adaptive comb filters cannot in general reveal periodic components in signals unless they are restricted to be Ramanujan filters. The paper also shows how Ramanujan filter banks can be used to generate time-period plane plots which track the presence of time varying, localized, periodic components.	[Vaidyanathan, P.

Due to GaN's high electric field breakdown capability and good 2D electron gas mobility in heterostructure field effect transistors, GaN power amplifiers provide best performance for high output power, high efficiency and small MMIC form factor amplifiers at W-band frequencies. GaN low noise amplifiers can also provide large receiver input dynamic range, reduce receiver noise figure and can be more tolerant of input power leakage from the transmitter without the need of protective limiter circuitry. All these characteristics are crucial for high frequency arrays where design require small circuit spacings, high efficiency to reduce power consumption and heating, and the minimization of circuit components for manufacturability and reliability. We will discuss results of power, driver and low noise amplifiers that we have designed, fabricated and characterized for radar array applications.

We assume that the process noise and measurement noise of the system are l(infinity) functions. The adversary compromises at most gamma sensors, the set of which is unknown to the estimation algorithm, and can change their measurements arbitrarily. We first prove that if after removing a set of 2 gamma sensors, the system is undetectable, then there exists a destabilizing noise process and attacker's input to render the estimation error unbounded. For the case that the system remains detectable after removing an arbitrary set of 2 gamma sensors, we construct a resilient estimator and provide an upper bound on the l(infinity) norm of the estimation error. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimator design.

Large-scale renewable penetration calls for real-time feedback control, and hence the need for distributed solutions for the OPF problem. In this paper we propose a solution for an unbalanced radial distribution network. Our distributed algorithm is based on alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). The main idea is to exploit the tree topology of distribution networks and decompose the OPF problem in such a way that the subproblems in each ADMM macro-iteration either have closed-form solutions or reduce to eigenvalue problems whose size remains constant as the network size scales up. We present simulations on IEEE 13, 34, 37 and 123 bus unbalanced distribution network to illustrate the scalability and optimality of the proposed algorithm.

They can be used to verify the link of Vesta's surface composition to the HED meteorites. Further, these absorptions are very sensitive to space weathering effects, especially the mixing of the pyroxenes on Vesta's surface with exogenic dark opaque material. Their distribution across the surface and association to specific surface features provide unique infounation about the ages/degradation of these surface features and the nature of space weathering processes on Vesta. However, these absorptions are usually very faint and thus often difficult to be identified in the individual spectra.

In this paper, a source component-based anomaly detection approach is proposed. It first extracts the source components in the spectral image data cube by using the blind source component separation and then identifies the components that are anomaly (or salient) to other components. We interpret the anomaly detection as a matrix decomposition problem with the minimum volume constraint for the multi-modular background and sparsity constraint for the anomaly image pixels. Experimental results show that the approach is promising for anomaly detection in spectral data cube.

A Mixed Integer Convex Programming Approach to Constrained Attitude Guidance	2015 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 15-17, 2015	Linz, AUSTRIA				PREDICTIVE CONTROL ALGORITHM	This paper introduces a new algorithm for attitude motion planning, Constrained Attitude Guidance (CAG) problem, in the presence of angular rate constraints and conic exclusion regions (pointing constraints). The CAG problem is solved by considering only the quaternion kinematics in the formulation and using constraints on quaternions and its time derivatives to indirectly apply bounds on the angular rates and accelerations. The CAG formulation makes use of Mixed Integer Convex Programming (MICP) in order to impose, approximately, the unity constraint on the quaternion magnitude, where the approximation accuracy can be set to a desired accuracy. The solution complexity of the MICP formulation increases exponentially with the number of binary variables that are used to impose the unit norm constraint on the quaternion. Since this number is independent of the number of exclusion pointing constraints, the solution approach has favorable complexity in terms of the number of pointing constraints. The paper also provides a numerical example that incorporates both angular rate and pointing constraints.

The developed method identifies not a single parameter but a set of parameters that all explain time-series experimental data, enabling the systematic characterization of the uncertainty of identified parameters. Our key idea is to use a state-space realization that has the same input-output behavior as experimental data instead of the experimental data itself for the identification. This allows us to relax the originally nonlinear identification problem to an LMI feasibility problem validating the norm bound of an error system. We show that regions of parameters can be efficiently classified into consistent and inconsistent parameter sets by combining the LMI feasibility problems and a generalized bisection algorithm.

These jobs are often running over thousands of CPU cores and simultaneously performing data accesses, data movements, and computation. It is difficult to identify bottlenecks or to debug the performance issues in these large workflows. To address these challenges, we have developed Performance Analysis Tool for HPC Applications (PATHA) using the state-of-art open source big data processing tools. Our framework can ingest system logs to extract key performance measures, and apply the most sophisticated statistical tools and data mining methods on the performance data. It utilizes an efficient data processing engine to allow users to interactively analyze a large amount of different types of logs and measurements. To illustrate the functionality of PATHA, we conduct a case study on the workflows from an astronomy project known as the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Our study processed 1.6 TB of system logs collected on the NERSC supercomputer Edison. Using PATHA, we were able to identify performance bottlenecks, which reside in three tasks of PTF workflow with the dependency on the density of celestial objects.

Dark Ages Radio Explorer Mission: Probing the Cosmic Dawn	2015 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2015	Big Sky, MT					The period between the creation of the cosmic microwave background at a redshift of similar to 1000 and the formation of the first stars and black holes that re-ionize the intergalactic medium at redshifts of 10-20 is currently unobservable. The baryonic component of the universe during this period is almost entirely neutral hydrogen, which falls into local regions of higher dark matter density. This seeds the formation of large-scale structures including the cosmic web that we see today in the filamentary distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The only detectable signal from these dark ages is the 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen, redshifted down to frequencies of approximately 10-100 MHz. Space-based observations of this signal will allow us to determine the formation epoch and physics of the first sources of ionizing radiation, and potentially detect evidence for the decay of dark matter particles. JPL is developing deployable low frequency antenna and receiver prototypes and calibration techniques to enable both all-sky spectral measurements of neutral hydrogen and ultimately to map the spatial distribution of the signal as a function of redshift. Such observations must be done from space because of Earth's ionosphere and ubiquitous radio interference. Both lunar orbiting and lunar surface based instruments are under development. A specific application of these technologies is the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission. This small Explorer class mission is designed to measure the sky-averaged hydrogen signal from the shielded region above the far side of the Moon. Observations of neutral hydrogen from the dark ages and the cosmic dawn (when light from the first generation of stars appeared) will provide unique and critical information on the early evolution of the universe. These data will complement ground-based radio observations of the final stages of intergalactic re-ionization at higher frequencies. DARE will also serve as a scientific percursor for space-based interferometry missions to image the distirbution of hydrogen during the cosmic dark ages.	[Jones, Dayton L.; Lazio, T.

A Risk-Aware Architecture for Resilient Spacecraft Operations	2015 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2015	Big Sky, MT					In this paper we discuss a resilient, risk-aware software architecture for onboard, real-time autonomous operations that is intended to robustly handle uncertainty in spacecraft behavior within hazardous and unconstrained environments, without unnecessarily increasing complexity. This architecture, the Resilient Spacecraft Executive (RSE), serves three main functions: (1) adapting to component failures to allow graceful degradation, (2) accommodating environments, science observations, and spacecraft capabilities that are not fully known in advance, and (3) making risk-aware decisions without waiting for slow ground-based reactions. This RSE is made up of four main parts: deliberative, habitual, and reflexive layers, and a state estimator that interfaces with all three. We use a risk-aware goal-directed executive within the deliberative layer to perform risk-informed planning, to satisfy the mission goals (specified by mission control) within the specified priorities and constraints. Other state-of-the-art algorithms to be integrated into the RSE include correct-by-construction control synthesis and model-based estimation and diagnosis. We demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture in a simple implementation of the RSE for a simulated Mars rover scenario.	[McGhan, Catharine L.

Ideally they should be lightweight and low-cost. This paper presents a new hardware actuator technology concept to address the above needs. In the concept, a compact integrated motor-transmission-joint mechanism is optimized for size and torque density, while providing good joint support. This is achieved by novel arrangement of multifunction mechanical components and external-rotor motor technology and advantageous use of structural symmetry. Finite element results show the potential to deliver more than 200 Nm of continuous torque at 50 Deg/s in a package as small as a human elbow joint.

A photovoltaic array embedded under the eye's conjunctiva coverts incident solar energy to electrical energy to be stored in a battery. We have shown that a photovoltaic array embedded under the conjunctiva, with an area of 62mm(2), when irradiated at 1mW/mm(2) of sunlight, can generate 1.22mW at the battery charging circuit's output. This suggests the feasibility of powering ocular implants by scavenging solar energy from the environment.	[Murali, K.; Humayun, M.

To obey international marine traffic regulations, these vessels must be equipped with machine vision systems that can classify other ships nearby during the day and night. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing VAIS, the world's first publicly available dataset of paired visible and infrared ship imagery. This dataset contains more than 1,000 paired RGB and infrared images among six ship categories - merchant, sailing, passenger, medium, tug, and small - which are salient for control and following maritime traffic regulations. We provide baseline results on this dataset using two off-the-shelf algorithms: gnostic fields and deep convolutional neural networks. Using these classifiers, we are able to achieve 87.4% mean per-class recognition accuracy during the day and 61.0% at night.

The randomness invariably causes inter-symbol interference (ISI) in MC, an issue largely ignored or simplified. In this paper we derive an upper bound and two lower bounds for MC based on amplitude shift keying (ASK) in presence of ISI.

COPRIME ARRAYS AND SAMPLERS FOR SPACE-TIME ADAPTIVE PROCESSING	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	40th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	APR 19-24, 2015	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Signal Proc Soc		Coprime arrays; coprime samplers; joint angle-Doppler estimation; the MUSIC algorithm	OF-ARRIVAL ESTIMATION	This paper extends the use of coprime arrays and samplers for the case of moving sources. Space-time adaptive processing (STAP) plays an important role in estimating direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) and radial velocities of emitting sources. However, the detection performance is fundamentally limited by the array geometry and the temporal samplers at each sensor. Coprime arrays and coprime samplers offer an enhanced degree of freedom of O(MN) using only O(M + N) physical sensors or samples. In this paper, we propose coprime joint angle-Doppler estimation (coprime JADE), which incorporates both coprime arrays and coprime samplers with the STAP framework. Nonuniform time samples at different sensors can be used to generate a sampled autocorrelation matrix, from which we compute a spatial smoothed matrix. It will be proved that spatial smoothed matrices can be used in the MUSIC algorithm for parameter estimation. With sufficient snapshots, coprime JADE distinguishes O(M1N1M2N2) independent sources if it corresponds to coprime arrays and coprime samplers with coprime integers (M-1, N-1) and (M-2, N-2), respectively. It is verified through simulations that coprime JADE resolves the angle-Doppler information better compared to other conventional algorithms.	[Liu, Chun-Lin; Vaidyanathan, P.

This problem has received a lot of attention over the last few decades, but not much is known about conditions under which the STFT magnitude is a unique signal representation. Also, the recovery techniques proposed by researchers are mostly heuristic in nature. In this work, we first show that almost all signals can be uniquely identified by their STFT magnitude under mild conditions. Then, we consider a semidefinite relaxation-based algorithm and provide the first theoretical guarantees for the same. Numerical simulations complement our theoretical analysis and provide many directions for future work.

One standard approach is to solve the following convex program (x) over cap = arg min(x) parallel to y - Ax parallel to(2) + lambda parallel to x parallel to(1), which is known as the l(2)-LASSO. We assume that the entries of the sensing matrix A and of the noise vector z are i.i.d Gaussian with variances 1/m and sigma(2). In the large system limit when the problem dimensions grow to infinity, but in constant rates, we precisely characterize the limiting behavior of the normalized squared error parallel to(x) over cap - x(0)parallel to(2)(2)/sigma(2).

Recently the author developed a new type of Ramanujan-sum representation especially suited for finite duration sequences x(n). This is based on decomposing x(n) into a sum of signals belonging to so-called Ramanujan subspaces S-qi. This offers an efficient way to identify periodic components using integer computations and projections, since c(q)(n) is integer valued. This paper revisits multidimensional signals with periodicity on possibly nonseparable integer lattices. Multidimensional Ramanujan-sum and Ramanujan-subspaces are developed for this case. A Ramanujan-sum based expansion for multidimensional signals is then proposed, which is useful to identify periodic components on nonseparable lattices.	[Vaidyanathan, P.

These filter-banks are inspired from recent techniques on period estimation using high-dimensional dictionary representations for periodic signals. Apart from inheriting the numerous advantages of the dictionary based techniques over conventional period-estimation methods such as those using the DFT, the filter-banks proposed here expand the domain of problems that can be addressed to a much richer set. For instance, we can now characterize the behavior of signals whose periodic nature changes with time. This includes signals that are periodic only for a short duration and signals such as chirps. For such signals, we use a time vs period plane analogous to the traditional time vs frequency plane. We will show that such filter banks have a fundamental connection to Ramanujan Sums and the Ramanujan Periodicity Transform.	[Tenneti, Srikanth V.; Vaidyanathan, P.

However, coprime DFTFBs need to be designed properly, to avoid unwanted bumps in stopbands or unsatisfactory total spectrum coverage, quantified by overall amplitude responses. In this paper, a detailed theoretical analysis will be made on the tradeoffs between bumps and overall amplitude responses. It will be shown that the bump level at the center frequency f(b) of a bump, is approximately one-fourth of the overall amplitude response at f(b). Then, a novel design will be introduced based on an optimization problem pertaining to overall amplitude responses. The original problem is relaxed to a computationally tractable optimization program, which can be solved with alternating minimization algorithms. It is verified with simulations that the new designs cover the spectrum completely.	[Liu, Chun-Lin; Vaidyanathan, P.

Based on methods for signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI), generalized Analog Thresholding (gAT-n) is able to sample square waves at a much lower rate under ideal conditions. The target application is efficient, real-time, implantable neurotechnology that extracts spiking neural signals from the brain. This paper studies the effect of integrator noise and quantization error on the accuracy of reconstructed square waves. We explore realistic values for integrator noise and input signal amplitude, using specifications from the Texas Instruments IVC102 integrator chip as a first pass example because of its readily-available data sheet. ADC resolution is varied from 1 to 16 bits.

In this paper, we propose a Low-rank Tensor Decomposition based anomaly Detection (LTDD) algorithm for Hyperspectral Imagery. The HSI data cube is first modeled as a dense low-rank tensor plus a sparse tensor. Based on the obtained low-rank tensor, LTDD further decomposes the low-rank tensor using Tucker decomposition to extract the core tensor which is treated as the "support" of the anomaly spectral signatures. LTDD then adopts an unmixing approach to the reconstructed core tensor for anomaly detection. The experiments based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets verify the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Scaling Controllable Adhesives to Grapple Floating Objects in Space	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)	MAY 26-30, 2015	Seattle, WA	IEEE				As the number of rocket bodies and other debris in Earth's orbit increases, the need to capture and remove this space junk becomes essential to protect new satellites. A low cost solution may include gecko-inspired directional adhesives, which require almost no compressive preload to generate adhesion and are therefore suitable for surface grasping in space where objects are free floating. Current individual adhesive units with a pair of opposed pads achieve a limit of 13N normal to the surface. Instead of using a single large unit to generate high levels of adhesion, using multiple small gripper units is desirable to prevent single-point failures and to conform to higher curvatures. For this strategy to succeed, it is essential to distribute the overall force evenly, to minimize the overall preload normal to the surface, and to prevent local failures from propagating over the array. We present two load sharing mechanisms. The first uses nearly-constant force springs in parallel. The second uses a tendon and pulleys in series. Both allow a 4-unit gripper to maintain the same adhesive stress as a single unit. A normal adhesive load to compressive preload ratio of 100:1 is demonstrated. Zero gravity experiments and air bearing floor experiments demonstrate the gripper's functionality in a simulated space environment. Design considerations are discussed for further scaling, with the trade-offs among load sharing, suitability for different surfaces, and failure sensitivity.

There has been only a limited rigorous treatment of the equilibrium and dynamical properties of such feedback systems. In this paper, we expand on our prior result that reverse-engineers a class of non-incremental voltage control schemes and provides a principled way to rigorously engineer the control to incorporate new design goals and/or achieve better dynamical properties. Specifically, it has been observed in the literature that in practical circumstances the droop-based control scheme, a commonly adopted non-incremental voltage control, can lead to undesirable oscillatory behaviors even in the case of a single inverter unit. This motivates us to forward-engineer the local voltage control and apply the (sub) gradient method to design an incremental voltage control algorithm that demands less restrictive condition for convergence. We provide a sufficient condition to ensure convergence of the proposed control algorithm and evaluate its performance on a real-world distribution feeder in Southern California with multiple large PV generation units through simulations.

In this study, a change detection using multi-temporal polarimetric UAVSAR data was investigated in urban environment. The most robust polarimetric parameter was evaluated, and change detction techniques using maximum likelihood ratio and hyperbolic tanget function were applied to the selected parameters. The comparison results with Google Earth's historical images showed a quite good agreement. A fitting of hyperbolic tangent function to the multi-temporal polarimetric parameters much reduced the false alarm rate, and it also provide whether the building was constructed or destructed and when the the changes occurred.

Here, f is a convex regularization function (e.g. l(1)-norm, nuclearnorm) aiming to promote the structure of x(0) (e.g. sparse, low-rank), and, lambda >= 0 is the regularizer parameter. A related optimization problem, though not as popular or well-known, is often referred to as the generalized l(2)-LASSO and takes the form (x) over cap : = arg min(x) 1/2 vertical bar vertical bar y - Ax vertical bar vertical bar(2)(2) + lambda f(x), and has been analyzed by Oymak, Thrampoulidis and Hassibi. Oymak et al. further made conjectures about the performance of the generalized l(2)(2)-LASSO. This paper establishes these conjectures rigorously. We measure performance with the normalized squared error NSE (sigma) : = vertical bar vertical bar(x) over cap - x(0) vertical bar 2 2/(m sigma(2)). Assuming the entries of A are i.i.d. Gaussian N (0,1/m) and those of v are i.i.d. N (0, 1), we precisely characterize the "asymptotic NSE" a NSE : = lim(sigma -> 0) NSE (sigma) when the problem dimensions tend to infinity in a proportional manner. The role of lambda, f and x(0) is explicitly captured in the derived expression via means of a single geometric quantity, the Gaussian distance to the subdifferential. We conjecture that a NSE = sup(sigma>0) NSE (sigma). We include detailed discussions on the interpretation of our result, make connections to relevant literature and perform computational experiments that validate our theoretical findings.

The high center of mass energy, the large number of simultaneous collision of beam particles in the experiments and the very high repetition rates of the collision events pose huge challenges. They result in extremely high particle fluxes, causing very high occupancies in the particle physics detectors operating at these machines. To reconstruct the physics events, the detectors have to make as much information as possible available on the final state particles. We briefly discuss how timing information with a precision of around 10 ps and below can aid the reconstruction of the physics events under such challenging conditions. We discuss different detector concepts which can provide time measurements for charged particles and photons with a precision in the range of a few 10 ps. We present in detail updated measurements utilizing a Lutetium -yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) based calorimeter prototype. With an improved understanding of the signal creation, light propagation and detection characteristics we achieve a precision of down to 30 ps for electrons with energies of 30 GeV. Further we present beam test measurements with a multichannel plate based detectors and studies using silicon detectors. We discuss possible implementations based on these different technologies in a large scale particle physics detector.

We analyze historical adoption patterns and find that monetary savings is the most important factor in the adoption of PV, superseding all socioeconomic factors. On the basis of the findings from our data analysis, we created an application available on Google App Engine (GAE), that allows researchers, policymakers and regulators to study the complex relationship between PV adoption, grid sustainability and utility economics. This application allows users to experiment with a variety of scenarios including different tier structures, subsidies and customer demographics. We showcase the type of analyses that are possible with this application by using it to study the impact of different policies regarding tier structures, fixed charges and PV prices.

The urgency to improve NAND flash reliability encourages searching for optimal channel coding methods. This paper reports our efforts towards a read channel for flash memories using polar coding. Our contributions include the solutions to several challenges raised when applying polar codes to NAND flash memories in practice. We propose efficient schemes for shortening both non-systematic and systematic polar codes, making polar codewords be easily adapted to flash page of any size. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of the shortened polar codes and LDPC codes are comparable using the data obtained by our NAND flash characterization platform. We show the feasibility of a practical adaptive decoding framework where it is not necessary to construct new polar codes for different channel parameters. Experimental results show that the decoding performance approaches the optimized performance where different codes are constructed for different channel conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of polar codes for error correction in flash memories.

This highlights the need for joint design of traffic engineering and caching strategies. We present a systematic framework for joint dynamic interest request forwarding and dynamic cache placement and eviction, within the context of the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. The framework employs a virtual control plane which operates on the user demand rate for data objects in the network, and an actual plane which handles Interest Packets and Data Packets. We develop distributed algorithms within the virtual plane to achieve network load balancing through dynamic forwarding and caching, thereby maximizing the user demand rate that the NDN network can satisfy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the resulting algorithms for the actual plane in terms of low user delay.

The production deployment of IPv6 on WLCG	21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP2015), PARTS 1-9	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	APR 13-17, 2015	Okinawa, JAPAN					The world is rapidly running out of IPv4 addresses; the number of IPv6 end systems connected to the internet is increasing; WLCG and the LHC experiments may soon have access to worker nodes and/or virtual machines (VMs) possessing only an IPv6 routable address. The HEPiX IPv6 Working Group has been investigating, testing and planning for dual-stack services on WLCG for several years. Following feedback from our working group, many of the storage technologies in use on WLCG have recently been made IPv6-capable. This paper presents the IPv6 requirements, tests and plans of the LHC experiments together with the tests performed on the group's IPv6 test-bed. This is primarily aimed at IPv6-only worker nodes or VMs accessing several different implementations of a global dual-stack federated storage service. Finally the plans for deployment of production dual-stack WLCG services are presented.

We show that it is not complete under logspace reductions, and indeed it is not even hard for TC0 under uniform AC(0) reductions. We obtain a variety of consequences that follow if oracle versions of MCSP are hard for various complexity classes under different types of reductions.

Here we have demonstrated an unambiguous correlation between the catalytic performance and the composition/crystallinity of molybdenum sulfide. The results indicate that the crystallinity plays an overwhelming role in determining the catalytic performance, while the composition does not matter much. The crystallinity can affect the three figures of merit of the catalytic performance (Tafel slope, turnover frequency (TOF), and stability) in opposite directions. Generally, the materials with low crystalline quality may provide low Tafel slopes (similar to 40 mV/dec), while highly crystalline molybdenum sulfide shows higher TOFs (by 2 orders of magnitude) and better stability. DFT calculations suggest that the terminal disulfur complex S-2(2), which may exist in MoS3 and also likely MoS2 of low crystalline quality due to its structural disorder, could be the true catalytically active site responsible for the low Tafel slope. Our results indicate that one key issue for the rational design of high-performance molybdenum sulfide HER catalysts is to engineer the crystallinity such that balancing its contradictory effects on the different aspects of the catalytic performance. We show that nanocrystalline MoS2 with few-layer nanoclusters in a lateral size of 530 nm provides a more promising platform than either amorphous or highly crystalline molybdenum sulfide due to its combination of low Tafel slopes and good stability. As a way to illustrate this notion, we have developed a MoS2 catalyst by engineering the crystallinity that shows Tafel slopes of 40 mV/dec, exchange current densities of 3.5 mu A/cm(2), and extraordinary stability with constant performance over >10000 cycles, which are among the best values ever reported. The performance of this catalyst could be further improved by using rougher substrates or doping to improve the relatively low exchange current density.

It models settings where there is uncertainty regarding which submodular function to optimize. In this paper, we propose a new extension, which we call smooth interactive submodular set cover, that allows the target threshold to vary depending on the plausibility of each hypothesis. We present the first algorithm for this more general setting with theoretical guarantees on optimality. We further show how to extend our approach to deal with realvalued functions, which yields new theoretical results for real-valued submodular set cover for both the interactive and non-interactive settings.

Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., g(i)(x) = sign(x + z(i)), corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate x(0) via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., (x) over cap := arg min(x) parallel to y - Ax(0)parallel to(2) + lambda f(x) for some regularization parameter lambda > 0 and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer f(.) that promotes the structure of x(0), e.g. l(1)-norm, nuclear-norm, etc. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function g(.), both Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown that, when the entries of A are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of x(0) up to a constant of proportionality mu, which only depends on g (.). In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions for parallel to(x) over cap - mu x(0)parallel to(2), for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when m and n grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear y(i) = mu a(i)(T)x(0) + sigma z(i), with mu = E gamma g(gamma) and sigma(2) = E(g(gamma) - mu gamma)(2), and, gamma standard normal. To the best of our knowledge, the derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the Generalized LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer.

Extremely intense (SML <=-2500 nT) substorms: isolated events that are externally triggered?	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE			English	Article						Magnetospheric physics; storms and substorms	GEOMAGNETIC-ACTIVITY; MAGNETIC-FIELDS; INTERPLANETARY; SHOCKS; STORMS; SOLAR; WIND	We examine particularly intense substorms (SML <= -2500 nT), hereafter called "supersubstorms" or SSS events, to identify their nature and their magnetic storm dependences. It is found that these intense substorms are typically isolated events and are only loosely related to magnetic storms. SSS events can occur during super (Dst <= -250 nT) and intense (100 nT >= Dst > -250) magnetic storms. SSS events can also occur during nonstorm (Dst >= -50 nT) intervals. SSSs are important because the strongest ionospheric currents will flow during these events, potentially causing power outages on Earth. Several SSS examples are shown. SSS events appear to be externally triggered by small regions of very high density (similar to 30 to 50 cm(-3)) solar wind plasma parcels (PPs) impinging upon the magnetosphere. Precursor southward interplanetary magnetic fields are detected prior to the PPs hitting the magnetosphere. Our hypothesis is that these southward fields input energy into the magnetosphere/magnetotail and the PPs trigger the release of the stored energy.	[Tsurutani, B.

Observation of a new type of low-frequency waves at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE			English	Article						Magnetospheric physics (plasma waves and instabilities; solar wind interactions with unmagnetized bodies); solar physics astrophysics and astronomy (magnetic fields)	P GRIGG-SKJELLERUP; PLASMA ENVIRONMENT; ION; INSTABILITIES; MAGNETOMETER; RPC	We report on magnetic field measurements made in the innermost coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in its low-activity state. Quasi-coherent, large-amplitude (delta B/B similar to 1), compressional magnetic field oscillations at similar to 40 mHz dominate the immediate plasma environment of the nucleus. This differs from previously studied cometary interaction regions where waves at the cometary ion gyro-frequencies are the main feature. Thus classical pickup-ion-driven instabilities are unable to explain the observations. We propose a cross-field current instability associated with newborn cometary ion currents as a possible source mechanism.

J	Guth, L; Katz, NH				Guth, Larry; Katz, Nets Hawk			On the Erdos distinct distances problem in the plane	ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS			English	Article							ARRANGEMENTS; NUMBER	In this paper, we prove that a set of N points in R-2 has at least cN/log N distinct distances, thus obtaining the sharp exponent in a problem of Erdos. We follow the setup of Elekes and Sharir which, in the spirit of the Erlangen program, allows us to study the problem in the group of rigid motions of the plane. This converts the problem to one of point-line incidences in space. We introduce two new ideas in our proof. In order to control points where many lines are incident, we create a cell decomposition using the polynomial ham sandwich theorem. This creates a dichotomy: either most of the points are in the interiors of the cells, in which case we immediately get sharp results or, alternatively, the points lie on the walls of the cells, in which case they are in the zero-set of a polynomial of suprisingly low degree, and we may apply the algebraic method. In order to control points incident to only two lines, we use the flecnode polynomial of the Rev. George Salmon to conclude that most of the lines lie on a ruled surface. Then we use the geometry of ruled surfaces to complete the proof.

A Previously Uncharacterized, Nonphotosynthetic Member of the Chromatiaceae Is the Primary CO2-Fixing Constituent in a Self-Regenerating Biocathode	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							MICROBIAL ELECTROSYNTHESIS; COMMODITY CHEMICALS; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; GENE-EXPRESSION; PROTEIN; BACTERIAL; EVOLUTION; CO; PROTEOBACTERIA; METABOLISM	Biocathode extracellular electron transfer (EET) may be exploited for biotechnology applications, including microbially mediated O-2 reduction in microbial fuel cells and microbial electrosynthesis. However, biocathode mechanistic studies needed to improve or engineer functionality have been limited to a few select species that form sparse, homogeneous biofilms characterized by little or no growth. Attempts to cultivate isolates from biocathode environmental enrichments often fail due to a lack of some advantage provided by life in a consortium, highlighting the need to study and understand biocathode consortia in situ. Here, we present metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization of a previously described biocathode biofilm (+310 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]) enriched from seawater, reducing O-2, and presumably fixing CO2 for biomass generation. Metagenomics identified 16 distinct cluster genomes, 15 of which could be assigned at the family or genus level and whose abundance was roughly divided between Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. A total of 644 proteins were identified from shotgun metaproteomics and have been deposited in the the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001045. Cluster genomes were used to assign the taxonomic identities of 599 proteins, with Marinobacter, Chromatiaceae, and Labrenzia the most represented. RubisCO and phosphoribulokinase, along with 9 other Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle proteins, were identified from Chromatiaceae. In addition, proteins similar to those predicted for iron oxidation pathways of known iron-oxidizing bacteria were observed for Chromatiaceae. These findings represent the first description of putative EET and CO2 fixation mechanisms for a self-regenerating, self-sustaining multispecies biocathode, providing potential targets for functional engineering, as well as new insights into biocathode EET pathways using proteomics.

HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING OF KEPLER SMALL AND COOL EXOPLANET HOST STARS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; planetary systems; stars: late-type; stars: statistics	FALSE POSITIVES; PLANET; VALIDATION; OBJECTS; BINARY	High-resolution imaging is an important tool for follow-up study of exoplanet candidates found via transit detection with the Kepler mission. We discuss here Hubble Space Telescope imaging with the WFC3 of 23 stars that host particularly interesting Kepler planet candidates based on their small size and cool equilibrium temperature estimates. Results include detections, exclusion of background stars that could be a source of false positives for the transits, and detection of physically associated companions in a number of cases providing dilution measures necessary for planet parameter refinement. For six Kepler objects of interest, we find that there is ambiguity regarding which star hosts the transiting planet(s), with potentially strong implications for planetary characteristics. Our sample is evenly distributed in G, K, and M spectral types. Albeit with a small sample size, we find that physically associated binaries are more common than expected at each spectral type, reaching a factor of 10 frequency excess in M. We document the program detection sensitivities, detections, and deliverables to the Kepler follow-up program archive.	[Gilliland, Ronald L.; Cartier, Kimberly M.

Using a sample of nearby spiral galaxies with weak and strong bars, we explore the relationships between the star formation feature and stellar bars in galaxies. We find that galaxies with weak bars tend coincide with low concentrical star formation activity, while those with strong bars show a large scatter in the distribution of star formation activity. We find enhanced star formation activity in bulges toward stronger bars, although not predominantly, consistent with previous studies. Our results suggest that different stages of the secular process and many other factors may contribute to the complexity of the secular evolution. In addition, barred galaxies with intense star formation in bars tend to have active star formation in their bulges and disks, and bulges have higher star formation densities than bars and disks, indicating the evolutionary effects of bars. We then derived a possible criterion to quantify the different stages of the bar-driven physical process, while future work is needed because of the uncertainties.

The millimetre and sub-millimetre emission from planetary nebulae	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						planetary nebulae: general; radio continuum: ISM; submillimeter: ISM	PRE-LAUNCH STATUS; RADIO-CONTINUUM SPECTRA; ARRAY CAMERA IRAC; HELIX NEBULA; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; FLUX DENSITIES; INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; IONIZATION STRUCTURE; PHYSICAL CONDITIONS; SKY SURVEY	Late stages of stellar evolution are characterized by copious mass-loss events whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (CSE). Planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on a sample of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) in the important and relatively unexplored observational band between 30 and 857 GHz. Planck enables the assembly of comprehensive PNe spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio to far-IR frequencies. Modelling the derived SEDs provides us with information on physical properties of CSEs and the mass content of both main components: ionized gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm-mm waves; and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-IR emission. In particular, the amount of ionized gas and dust has been derived here. Such quantities have also been estimated for the very young PN CRL618, where the strong variability observed in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented constructing its SED. A morphological study of the Helix Nebula was also performed. Planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatial distribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify different components, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to 1 pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope is interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel, LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We found that the mean intensity of the radiation field < U > heating the dust (strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift up to z = 4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with simple models that account for the decrease in the gas metallicity with redshift. No evolution of < U > with redshift is found in strong starbursts. We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as M-mol/(M-mol + M-star)) with redshift and found a similar, steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z similar to 4, this fraction reaches similar to 60%. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the bulk of the star formation up to z = 4 is dominated by secular processes.

The VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS): fast increase in the fraction of strong Lyman-alpha emitters from z=2 to z=6	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: fundamental parameters; cosmology: observations	STAR-FORMATION HISTORIES; EVOLUTION SURVEY COSMOS; SIMILAR-TO 3; LY-ALPHA; BREAK GALAXIES; SPECTROSCOPIC CONFIRMATION; LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS; STELLAR POPULATIONS; EMITTING GALAXIES; DROPOUT GALAXIES	Aims. The aim of this work is to constrain the evolution of the fraction of strong Ly alpha emitters among UV selected star-forming galaxies at 2 < z < 6, and to measure the stellar escape fraction of Ly alpha photons over the same redshift range. Methods. We exploit the ultradeep spectroscopic observations with VIMOS on the VLT collected by the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS) to build an unique, complete, and unbiased sample of similar to 4000 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at 2 < z < 6. Our galaxy sample includes UV luminosities brighter than M-FUV* at 2 < z < 6, and luminosities down to one magnitude fainter than M-FUV* at 2 < z < 3.5. Results. We find that 80% of the star-forming galaxies in our sample have EW0(Ly alpha) < 10 angstrom, and correspondingly f(esc)(Ly alpha) < 1%. By comparing these results with the literature, we conclude that the bulk of the Ly alpha luminosity at 2 < z < 6 comes from galaxies that are fainter in the UV than those we sample in this work. The strong Ly alpha emitters constitute, at each redshift, the tail of the distribution of the galaxies with extreme EW0(Ly alpha) and f(esc)(Ly alpha). This tail of large EW0(Ly alpha) and f(esc)(Ly alpha) becomes more important as the redshift increases, and causes the fraction of strong Ly alpha with EW0(Ly alpha) > 25 angstrom to increase from similar to 5% at z similar to 2 to similar to 30% at z similar to 6, with the increase being stronger beyond z similar to 4. We observe no difference, for the narrow range of UV luninosities explored in this work, between the fraction of strong Ly alpha emitters among galaxies fainter or brighter than M-FUV*, although the fraction for the faint galaxies evolves faster, at 2 < z < 3.5, than for the bright ones. We do observe an anticorrelation between E(B - V) and f(esc)(Ly alpha): generally galaxies with high f(esc)(Ly alpha) also have small amounts of dust (and vice versa). However, when the dust content is low (E(B - V) < 0.05) We observe a very broad range of f(esc)(Ly alpha), ranging from 10(-3) to 1. This implies that the dust alone is not the only regulator of the amount of escaping Ly alpha photons.	[Cassata, P.; Tasca, L. A. M.; Le Fevre, O.; Lemaux, B. C.; Le Brun, V.; Thomas, R.; Cuby, J.

[C II] absorption and emission in the diffuse interstellar medium across the Galactic plane	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						ISM: general; ISM: structure; Galaxy: disk; infrared: ISM	STAR-FORMING REGIONS; FINE-STRUCTURE TRANSITIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUDS; G10.6-0.4 W31C; DATA RELEASE; SIGHT-LINES; SPIRAL-ARM; MILKY-WAY; HERSCHEL/HIFI OBSERVATIONS; TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES	Aims. Ionized carbon is the main gas-phase reservoir of carbon in the neutral diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and its 158 mu m fine structure transition [C II] is the most important cooling line of the diffuse ISM. We combine [C II] absorption and emission spectroscopy to gain an improved understanding of physical conditions in the different phases of the ISM. Methods. We present high-resolution [C II] spectra obtained with the Herschel/HIFI instrument towards bright dust continuum regions in the Galactic plane, probing simultaneously the diffuse gas along the line of sight and the background high-mass star forming regions. These data are complemented by single pointings in the 492 and 809 GHz fine structure lines of atomic carbon and by medium spectral resolution spectral maps of the fine structure lines of atomic oxygen at 63 and 145 mu m with Herschel/PACS. Results. We show that the presence of foreground absorption may completely cancel the emission from the background source in medium spectral resolution PACS data and that high spectral resolution spectra are needed to interpret the [C II] and [O I] emission and the [C II]/FIR ratio. This phenomenon may explain part of the [C II]/FIR deficit seen in external luminous infrared galaxies where the bright emission from the nuclear regions may be partially canceled by absorption from diffuse gas in the foreground. The C+ and C excitation in the diffuse gas is consistent with a median pressure of similar to 5900 K cm(-3) for a mean kinetic temperature of similar to 100 K. A few higher pressure regions are detected along the lines of sight, as emission features in both fine structure lines of atomic carbon. The knowledge of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor of the absorbing gas along the selected lines of sight. The derived median value of the filling factor is 2.4%, in good agreement with the properties of the Galactic cold neutral medium. The mean excitation temperature is used to derive the average cooling due to C+ in the Galactic plane : 9.5 x 10(-26) erg(-1)H(-1). Along the observed lines of sight, the gas phase carbon abundance does not exhibit a strong gradient as a function of Galacto-centric radius and has a weighted average of C/H = 1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10(-4).

The evolution of rotating very massive stars with LMC composition	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						stars: massive; stars: evolution; stars: rotation; stars: abundances; stars: early-type	WOLF-RAYET STARS; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; VLT-FLAMES SURVEY; O-TYPE STARS; LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; LUMINOUS BLUE VARIABLES; M-CIRCLE-DOT; EDDINGTON LIMIT; LOSS RATES; PRESUPERNOVA EVOLUTION	Context. With growing evidence for the existence of very massive stars at subsolar metallicity, there is an increased need for corresponding stellar evolution models. Aims. We present a dense model grid with a tailored input chemical composition appropriate for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods. We use a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code, which accounts for rotation, transport of angular momentum by magnetic fields, and stellar wind mass loss to compute our detailed models. We calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses from 70 to 500 M-circle dot and with initial surface rotational velocities from 0 to 550 km s(-1), covering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. Results. We find our rapid rotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium, with quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotating models. Above 160 M-circle dot, homogeneous evolution is also established through mass loss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent of the initial rotation rate. Surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slower rotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass. For models above similar to 150 M-circle dot at zero age, and for models in the whole considered mass range later on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity of these models to their Eddington limit. This leads to a maximum ZAMS surface temperature of similar to 56 000 K, at similar to 180 M-circle dot, and to an evolution of stars in the mass range 50 M-circle dot ... 100 M-circle dot to the regime of luminous blue variables in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with high internal Eddington factors. Inflation also leads to decreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution of stars above similar to 180 M-circle dot. Conclusions. The cool surface temperatures due to the envelope inflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars at LMC metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae. The corresponding spin-down will also prevent very massive LMC stars to produce long-duration gamma-ray bursts, which might, however, originate from lower masses.

The far-infrared/radio correlation and radio spectral index of galaxies in the SFR-M-* plane up to z similar to 2	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: starburst; galaxies: high-redshift; infrared: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; DEEP FIELD-SOUTH; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; ABSOLUTE SKY BRIGHTNESS; K-SELECTED GALAXIES; GOODS-NORTH FIELD; VLA-COSMOS SURVEY; 1.4 GHZ SURVEY; LESS-THAN 2; HIGH-REDSHIFT	We study the evolution of the radio spectral index and far-infrared/radio correlation (FRC) across the star-formation rate - stellar masse (i.e. SFR-M-*) plane up to z similar to 2. We start from a stellar-mass-selected sample of galaxies with reliable SI.--42 and redshift estimates. We then grid the SFR-M plane in several redshift ranges and measure the infrared luminosity, radio luminosity, radio spectral index, and ultimately the FRC index (i.e. q(FIR)) of each SFR-M-*-z bin. The infrared huninosities of our SFR-M-*-z bins are estimated using their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory. Their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices (i.e. alpha, where S-v proportional to v(-alpha)) are estimated using their stacked.4(11 GElz and 610 MHz :flux densities from the Very Large Array and Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope, respectively. Our far-infrared and radio observations include the most widely studied blank extragalactic fields - GOODS-N, GOODS-S, ECDFS, and COSMOS - covering a total sky area of similar to 2.0 deg(2). Using this methodology, we constrain the radio spectral index and FRC index of star-forming galaxies with M, > 1010 M and 0 < z < 2.3. We find that alpha(1.4GHz)(610MHz) does not evolve significantly- with redshift or with the distance of a galaxy with respect to the main sequence (MS) of the SFR-M-* plane (i.e. Delta log(SSFR)(MS) = log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFRMS(M-*,z]). Instead, star-forming galaxies have a radio spectral index consistent with a canonical value of 0.8, which suggests that their radio spectra are dominated by non-thermal optically thin synchrotron emission. We find that the FRC index, qp[R, displays a moderate but statistically significant redshift evolution as q(FIR) (z) = (2.35 +/- 0.08)x(1+z)(-0.12 +/- 0.04), consistent with some previous literature. Finally, we find no significant correlation between CM and Delta log(SSER)(MS), though a weak positive trend, as observed in one of our redshift bins (i.e. Delta[q(FIR)]/Delta[Delta logSSFR)(MS)] = 0.22 +/- 0.07 at 0.5 < z < 0.8), cannot be firmly ruled out using our dataset.

The host galaxies of X- ray selected active galactic nuclei to z=2.5: Structure, star formation, and their relationships from CANDELS and Herschel/PACS	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: structure; galaxies: star formation; surveys; methods: statistical; X-rays: galaxies	DEEP FIELD-SOUTH; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; SIMILAR-TO 2; BLACK-HOLE ACCRETION; ULTRALUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES; SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; MASSIVE GALAXIES; GOODS-HERSCHEL; SIZE EVOLUTION; MOLECULAR GAS	We study the relationship between the structure and star formation rate (SFR) of X-ray selected low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the two Chandra Deep Fields, using Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near Infrared Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and deep far-infrared maps from the PEP+GOODS-Herschel survey. We derive detailed distributions of structural parameters and FIR luminosities from carefully constructed control samples of galaxies, which we then compare to those of the AGNs. At z similar to 1, AGNs show slightly diskier light profiles than massive inactive (non-AGN) galaxies, as well as modestly higher levels of gross galaxy disturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpy structure). In contrast, at z similar to 2, AGNs show similar levels of galaxy disturbance as inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which may arise from a more pronounced bulge in AGN hosts or extinguished nuclear light. We undertake a number of tests of both these alternatives, but our results do not strongly favor one interpretation over the other. The mean SFR and its distribution among AGNs and inactive galaxies are similar at z > 1.5. At z < 1, however, clear and significant enhancements are seen in the SFRs of AGNs with bulge-dominated light profiles. These trends suggest an evolution in the relation between nuclear activity and host properties with redshift, towards a minor role for mergers and interactions at z > 1.5.	[Rosario, D.

MiNDSTEp Consortium	Searching for variable stars in the cores of five metal-rich globular clusters using EMCCD observations	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						globular clusters: individual; stars: variables: RR Lyrae; stars: variables: general; instrumentation: high angular resolution	RR-LYRAE STARS; IMAGE-SUBTRACTION PHOTOMETRY; COLOR-MAGNITUDE DIAGRAM; X-RAY BINARIES; NGC 6652; OPTICAL COUNTERPART; CCD PHOTOMETRY; NGC-6388; PARAMETERS; NGC-6441	Aims. In this paper, we present the analysis of time-series observations from 2013 and 2014 of five metal-rich ([Fe /H] > 1) globular clusters: NGC 6388, NGC 6441, NGC 6528, NGC 6638, and NGC 6652. The data have been used to perform a census of the variable stars in the central parts of these clusters. Methods. The observations were made with the electron-multiplying charge-couple device (EMCCD) camera at the Danish 1.54m Telescope at La Silla, Chile, and they were analysed using di ff erence image analysis to obtain high-precision light curves of the variable stars. Results. It was possible to identify and classify all of the previously known or suspected variable stars in the central regions of the five clusters. Furthermore, we were able to identify and, in most cases, classify 48, 49, 7, 8, and 2 previously unknown variables in NGC 6388, NGC 6441, NGC 6528, NGC 6638, and NGC 6652, respectively. Especially interesting is the case of NGC 6441, for which the variable star population of about 150 stars has been thoroughly examined by previous studies, including a Hubble Space Telescope study. In this paper we are able to present 49 new variable stars for this cluster, of which one (possibly two) are RR Lyrae stars, two areWVirginis stars, and the rest are long-period semi-regular or irregular variables on the red giant branch. We have also detected the first double-mode RR Lyrae in the cluster.	[Skottfelt, J.; Jorgensen, U. G.; Harpsoe, K. B.

An interferometric analysis method for radio impulses from ultra-high energy particle showers	ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS			English	Article						Radio; Interferometry; Neutrinos; Cosmic-rays	RAY AIR-SHOWERS; PULSES; EMISSION; CHARGE; ARRAY	We present an interferometric technique for the reconstruction of ultra-wide band impulsive signals from point sources. This highly sensitive method was developed for the search for ultra-high energy neutrinos with the ANITA experiment but is fully generalizable to any antenna array detecting radio impulsive events. Applications of the interferometric method include event reconstruction, thermal noise and anthropogenic background rejection, and solar imaging for calibrations. We illustrate this technique with applications from the analysis of the ANITA-I and ANITA-II data in the 200-1200 MHz band. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Romero-Wolf, A.; Gorham, P.

SUPPRESSION OF STAR FORMATION IN NGC 1266	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: individual (NGC 1266); galaxies: ISM; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: star formation; molecular data; radio continuum: galaxies; submillimeter: galaxies	SPECTRAL ENERGY-DISTRIBUTIONS; DRIVEN MOLECULAR OUTFLOW; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; EARLY-TYPE GALAXIES; ATLAS(3D) PROJECT; BLACK-HOLES; INFRARED GALAXIES; SCALING RELATIONS; QUASAR FEEDBACK; CO EMISSION	NGC 1266 is a nearby lenticular galaxy that harbors a massive outflow of molecular gas powered by the mechanical energy of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). It has been speculated that such outflows hinder star formation (SF) in their host galaxies, providing a form of feedback to the process of galaxy formation. Previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremely rare, high-power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on their hosts. Here we present detailed observations of the gas and dust continuum of NGC 1266 at millimeter wavelengths. Our observations show that molecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at <(M)over dot> approximate to 110 M-circle dot yr(-1), of which the vast majority cannot escape the nucleus. Only 2 M-circle dot yr(-1) is actually capable of escaping the galaxy. Most of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars. The far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact (less than or similar to 50 pc) source that could either be powered by an AGN or by an ultra-compact starburst. The ratio of the SF surface density (Sigma(SFR)) to the gas surface density (Sigma(H2)) indicates that SF is suppressed by a factor of approximate to 50 compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is forming stars, and approximate to 150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if the central region is powered by an ultra-compact starburst. The AGN-driven bulk outflow could account for this extreme suppression by hindering the fragmentation and gravitational collapse necessary to form stars through a process of turbulent injection. This result suggests that even relatively common, low-power AGNs are able to alter the evolution of their host galaxies as their black holes grow onto the M-sigma relation.

Near-ultraviolet (NUV) irradiation can erode and alter the chemistry of planetary atmospheres, and a quantitative description of the evolution of NUV emission from M dwarfs is needed when modeling these effects. We investigated the NUV luminosity evolution of early M-type dwarfs by cross-correlating the Lepine & Gaidos catalog of bright M dwarfs with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) catalog of NUV (1771-2831 angstrom) sources. Of the 4805 sources with GALEX counterparts, 797 have NUV emission significantly (>2.5 sigma) in excess of an empirical basal level. We inspected these candidate active stars using visible-wavelength spectra, high-resolution adaptive optics imaging, time-series photometry, and literature searches to identify cases where the elevated NUV emission is due to unresolved background sources or stellar companions; we estimated the overall occurrence of these "false positives" (FPs) as similar to 16%. We constructed an NUV luminosity function that accounted for FPs, detection biases of the source catalogs, and GALEX upper limits. We found the NUV luminosity function to be inconsistent with predictions from a constant star-formation rate and simplified age-activity relation defined by a two-parameter power law.

HST ROTATIONAL SPECTRAL MAPPING OF TWO L-TYPE BROWN DWARFS: VARIABILITY IN AND OUT OF WATER BANDS INDICATES HIGH-ALTITUDE HAZE LAYERS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; stars: atmospheres; stars: individual (2MASS J18212815+1414010, 2MASS J15074769-1627386, 2MASS J01365662+0933473); stars: low-mass	VERY-LOW MASS; T DWARFS; EVOLVING WEATHER; I. DETECTION; ATMOSPHERES; TRANSITION; DUST; PLANETS; PATCHY; CLOUDS	We present time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of two L5 dwarfs, 2MASS J18212815+1414010 and 2MASS J15074759-1627386, observed with the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We study the wavelength dependence of rotation-modulated flux variations between 1.1 mu m and 1.7 mu m. We find that the water absorption bands of the two L5 dwarfs at 1.15 mu m and 1.4 mu m vary at similar amplitudes as the adjacent continuum. This differs from the results of previous HST observations of L/T transition dwarfs, in which the water absorption at 1.4 mu m displays variations of about half of the amplitude at other wavelengths. We find that the relative amplitude of flux variability out of the water band with respect to that in the water band shows a increasing trend from the L5 dwarfs toward the early T dwarfs. We utilize the models of Saumon & Marley and find that the observed variability of the L5 dwarfs can be explained by the presence of spatially varying high-altitude haze layers above the condensate clouds. Therefore, our observations show that the heterogeneity of haze layers-the driver of the variability-must be located at very low pressures, where even the water opacity is negligible. In the near future, the rotational spectral mapping technique could be utilized for other atomic and molecular species to probe different pressure levels in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and exoplanets and uncover both horizontal and vertical cloud structures.

Half of our targets are younger than 135 Myr and 90% are younger than the Hyades (620 Myr). After removing 44 close stellar binaries (implying a stellar companion fraction of >35.4% +/- 4.3% within 100 AU), 27 of which are new or spatially resolved for the first time, our remaining sample of 78 single M dwarfs makes this the largest imaging search for planets around young low-mass stars (0.1-0.6 M-circle dot) to date. Our H- and K-band coronagraphic observations with Keck/NIRC2 and Subaru/HiCIAO achieve typical contrasts of 12-14 mag and 9-13 mag at 1 '', respectively, which correspond to limiting planet masses of 0.5-10 M-Jup at 5-33 AU for 85% of our sample. We discovered four young brown dwarf companions: 1RXS J235133.3+312720 B (32 +/- 6 M-Jup; L0(-1)(+2); 120 +/- 20 AU), GJ 3629 B (64(-23)(+30) M-Jup; M7.5 +/- 0.5; 6.5 +/- 0.5 AU), 1RXS J034231.8+121622 B (35 +/- 8 M-Jup; L0 +/- 1; 19.8 +/- 0.9 AU), and 2MASS J15594729+4403595 B (43 +/- 9 M-Jup; M8.0 +/- 0.5; 190 +/- 20 AU). Over 150 candidate planets were identified; we obtained follow-up imaging for 56% of these but all are consistent with background stars. Our null detection of planets enables strong statistical constraints on the occurrence rate of long-period giant planets around single M dwarfs. We infer an upper limit (at the 95% confidence level) of 10.3% and 16.0% for 1-13 M-Jup planets between 10-100 AU for hot-start and cold-start (Fortney) evolutionary models, respectively. Fewer than 6.0% (9.9%) of M dwarfs harbor massive gas giants in the 5-13 M-Jup range like those orbiting HR 8799 and beta Pictoris between 10-100 AU for a hot-start (coldstart) formation scenario. The frequency of brown dwarf (13-75 M-Jup) companions to single M dwarfs between 10-100 AU is 2.8(-1.5)(+2.4)%. Altogether we find that giant planets, especially massive ones, are rare in the outskirts of M dwarf planetary systems. Although the first directly imaged planets were found around massive stars, there is currently no statistical evidence for a trend of giant planet frequency with stellar host mass at large separations as predicted by the disk instability model of giant planet formation.

Inverse modelling of CH4 emissions for 2010-2011 using different satellite retrieval products from GOSAT and SCIAMACHY	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							C-13/C-12 ISOTOPIC-RATIOS; ATMOSPHERIC METHANE; DATA ASSIMILATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; SURFACE; CHEMISTRY; GASES; SCALE; FTS; CALIBRATION	At the beginning of 2009 new space-borne observations of dry-air column-averaged mole fractions of atmospheric methane (XCH4) became available from the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observations-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) instrument on board the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). Until April 2012 concurrent methane (CH4) retrievals were provided by the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY) instrument on board the ENVironmental SATellite (ENVISAT). The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrievals can be compared during the period of overlap. We estimate monthly average CH4 emissions between January 2010 and December 2011, using the TM5-4DVAR inverse modelling system. In addition to satellite data, high-accuracy measurements from the Cooperative Air Sampling Network of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA ESRL) are used, providing strong constraints on the remote surface atmosphere. We discuss five inversion scenarios that make use of different GOSAT and SCIAMACHY XCH4 retrieval products, including two sets of GOSAT proxy retrievals processed independently by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON)/Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and the University of Leicester (UL), and the RemoTeC "Full-Physics" (FP) XCH4 retrievals available from SRON/KIT. The GOSAT-based inversions show significant reductions in the root mean square (rms) difference between retrieved and modelled XCH4, and require much smaller bias corrections compared to the inversion using SCIAMACHY retrievals, reflecting the higher precision and relative accuracy of the GOSAT XCH4. Despite the large differences between the GOSAT and SCIAMACHY retrievals, 2-year average emission maps show overall good agreement among all satellite-based inversions, with consistent flux adjustment patterns, particularly across equatorial Africa and North America. Over North America, the satellite inversions result in a significant redistribution of CH4 emissions from North-East to South-Central United States. This result is consistent with recent independent studies suggesting a systematic underestimation of CH4 emissions from North American fossil fuel sources in bottom-up inventories, likely related to natural gas production facilities. Furthermore, all four satellite inversions yield lower CH4 fluxes across the Congo basin compared to the NOAA-only scenario, but higher emissions across tropical East Africa. The GOSAT and SCIAMACHY inversions show similar performance when validated against independent shipboard and aircraft observations, and XCH4 retrievals available from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON).

Mapping CH4 : CO2 ratios in Los Angeles with CLARS-FTS from Mount Wilson, California	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; METHANE; SCATTERING; BASIN	The Los Angeles megacity, which is home to more than 40% of the population in California, is the second largest megacity in the United States and an intense source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs). Quantifying GHG emissions from the megacity and monitoring their spatiotemporal trends are essential to be able to understand the effectiveness of emission control policies. Here we measure carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) across the Los Angeles megacity using a novel approach -ground-based remote sensing from a mountaintop site. A Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) with agile pointing optics, located on Mount Wilson at 1.67 km above sea level, measures reflected nearinfrared sunlight from 29 different surface targets on Mount Wilson and in the Los Angeles megacity to retrieve the slant column abundances of CO2, CH4 and other trace gases above and below Mount Wilson. This technique provides persistent space-and time-resolved observations of path-averaged dry-air GHG concentrations, XGHG, in the Los Angeles megacity and simulates observations from a geostationary satellite. In this study, we combined high-sensitivity measurements from the FTS and the panorama from Mount Wilson to characterize anthropogenic CH4 emissions in the megacity using tracer-tracer correlations. During the period between September 2011 and October 2013, the observed XCH4 : XCO2 excess ratio, assigned to anthropogenic activities, varied from 5.4 to 7.3 ppb CH4 (ppm CO2)(-1), with an average of 6.4 +/-0.5 ppb CH4 (ppm CO2)(-1) compared to the value of 4.6 +/- 0.9 ppb CH4 (ppm CO2)(-1) expected from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) bottom-up emis-sion inventory. Persistent elevated XCH4 : XCO2 excess ratios were observed in Pasadena and in the eastern Los Angeles megacity. Using the FTS observations on Mount Wilson and the bottom-up CO2 emission inventory, we derived a topdown CH4 emission of 0.39 +/- 0.06 TgCH(4) year(-1) in the Los Angeles megacity. This is 18-61% larger than the state government's bottom-up CH4 emission inventory and consistent with previous studies.	[Wong, K. W.; Fu, D.; Pongetti, T. J.; Duren, R.; Miller, C. E.; Sander, S.

Biases in atmospheric CO2 estimates from correlated meteorology modeling errors	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE; TRANSPORT MODELS; FLUX ESTIMATION; INVERSIONS; EXCHANGE; SIMULATIONS	Estimates of CO2 fluxes that are based on atmospheric measurements rely upon a meteorology model to simulate atmospheric transport. These models provide a quantitative link between the surface fluxes and CO2 measurements taken downwind. Errors in the meteorology can therefore cause errors in the estimated CO2 fluxes. Meteorology errors that correlate or covary across time and/or space are particularly worrisome; they can cause biases in modeled atmospheric CO2 that are easily confused with the CO2 signal from surface fluxes, and they are difficult to characterize. In this paper, we leverage an ensemble of global meteorology model outputs combined with a data assimilation system to estimate these biases in modeled atmospheric CO2. In one case study, we estimate the magnitude of month-long CO2 biases relative to CO2 boundary layer enhancements and quantify how that answer changes if we either include or remove error correlations or covariances. In a second case study, we investigate which meteorological conditions are associated with these CO2 biases. In the first case study, we estimate uncertainties of 0.57 ppm in monthly-averaged CO2 concentrations, depending upon location (95% confidence interval). These uncertainties correspond to 13-150% of the mean afternoon CO2 boundary layer enhancement at individual observation sites. When we remove error covariances, however, this range drops to 222 %. Top-down studies that ignore these covariances could therefore underestimate the uncertainties and/or propagate transport errors into the flux estimate. In the second case study, we find that these month-long errors in atmospheric transport are anti-correlated with temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height over terrestrial regions. In marine environments, by contrast, these errors are more strongly associated with weak zonal winds. Many errors, however, are not correlated with a single meteorological parameter, suggesting that a single meteorological proxy is not sufficient to characterize uncertainties in atmospheric CO2. Together, these two case studies provide information to improve the setup of future top-down inverse modeling studies, preventing unforeseen biases in estimated CO2 fluxes.	[Miller, S. M.; Hayek, M.

Intercomparison of vertically resolved merged satellite ozone data sets: interannual variability and long-term trends	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; SAGE-II; DIURNAL-VARIATIONS; TECHNICAL NOTE; COLUMN OZONE; CLIMATOLOGY; PROFILES; VALIDATION; RECOVERY; QUALITY	In the framework of the SI2N (SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate)/IO3C (International Ozone Commission)/IGACO-O3 (Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations - Ozone)/NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change)) initiative, several long-term vertically resolved merged ozone data sets produced from satellite measurements have been analysed and compared. This paper presents an overview of the methods, assumptions, and challenges involved in constructing such merged data sets, as well as the first thorough intercomparison of seven new long-term satellite data sets. The analysis focuses on the representation of the annual cycle, interannual variability, and long-term trends for the period 1984-2011, which is common to all data sets. Overall, the best agreement amongst data sets is seen in the mid-latitude lower and middle stratosphere, with larger differences in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the upper stratosphere globally. In most cases, differences in the choice of underlying instrument records that were merged produced larger differences between data sets than the use of different merging techniques. Long-term ozone trends were calculated for the period 1984-2011 using a piecewise linear regression with a change in trend prescribed at the end of 1997. For the 1984-1997 period, trends tend to be most similar between data sets (with largest negative trends ranging from -4 to -8% decade(-1) in the mid-latitude upper stratosphere), in large part due to the fact that most data sets are predominantly (or only) based on the SAGE-II record. Trends in the middle and lower stratosphere are much smaller, and, particularly for the lower stratosphere, large uncertainties remain. For the later period (1998-2011), trends vary to a greater extent, ranging from approximately -1 to +5% decade(-1) in the upper stratosphere. Again, middle and lower stratospheric trends are smaller and for most data sets not significantly different from zero. Overall, however, there is a clear shift from mostly negative to mostly positive trends between the two periods over much of the profile.

Vapor wall deposition in Teflon chambers	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ORGANIC AEROSOL FORMATION; GAS SORPTION; SOA FORMATION; OH RADICALS; N-ALKANES; YIELDS; PHOTOOXIDATION; PERMEATION; MECHANISM	Teflon chambers are ubiquitous in studies of atmospheric chemistry. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation can be underestimated, owing to deposition of SOA-forming vapors to the chamber wall. We present here an experimental protocol and a model framework to constrain the vapor-wall interactions in Teflon chambers. We measured the wall deposition rates of 25 oxidized organic compounds generated from the photooxidation of isoprene, toluene, alpha-pinene, and dodecane in two chambers that had been extensively used and in two new unused chambers. We found that the extent of prior use of the chamber did not significantly affect the sorption behavior of the Teflon films. Among the 25 compounds studied, the maximum wall deposition rate is exhibited by the most highly oxygenated and least volatile compounds. By optimizing the model output to the observed vapor decay profiles, we identified that the dominant parameter governing the extent of wall deposition of a compound is its wall accommodation coefficient (alpha(w,i)), which can be correlated through its volatility with the number of carbons and oxygens in the molecule. By doing so, the wall-induced deposition rate of intermediate/semi-volatile organic vapors can be reasonably predicted based on their molecular constituency. The extent to which vapor wall deposition impacts measured SOA yields depends on the competition between uptake of organic vapors by suspended particles and the chamber wall. The timescale associated with vapor wall deposition can vary from minutes to hours depending on the value of alpha(w,i). For volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (small alpha(w,i)), gas-particle partitioning will dominate wall deposition for typical particle number concentrations in chamber experiments. For compounds characterized by relatively large alpha(w,i), vapor transport to particles is suppressed by competition with the chamber wall even with perfect particle accommodation.

Influence of particle-phase state on the hygroscopic behavior of mixed organic-inorganic aerosols	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							LIQUID-LIQUID EQUILIBRIA; AMMONIUM-SULFATE; WATER-UPTAKE; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS; RELATIVE-HUMIDITY; THERMODYNAMIC MODEL; DICARBOXYLIC-ACIDS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; GAS UPTAKE	Recent work has demonstrated that organic and mixed organic-inorganic particles can exhibit multiple phase states depending on their chemical composition and on ambient conditions such as relative humidity (RH). To explore the extent to which water uptake varies with particle-phase behavior, hygroscopic growth factors (HGFs) of nine laboratory-generated, organic and organic-inorganic aerosol systems with physical states ranging from well-mixed liquids to phase-separated particles to viscous liquids or semi-solids were measured with the Differential Aerosol Sizing and Hygroscopicity Spectrometer Probe at RH values ranging from 40 to 90 %. Water-uptake measurements were accompanied by HGF and RH-dependent thermodynamic equilibrium calculations using the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model. In addition, AIOMFAC-predicted growth curves are compared to several simplified HGF modeling approaches: (1) representing particles as ideal, well-mixed liquids; (2) forcing a single phase but accounting for non-ideal interactions through activity coefficient calculations; and (3) a Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson-like calculation in which complete separation of the inorganic and organic components is assumed at all RH values, with water uptake treated separately in each of the individual phases. We observed variability in the characteristics of measured hygroscopic growth curves across aerosol systems with differing phase behaviors, with growth curves approaching smoother, more continuous water uptake with decreasing prevalence of liquid-liquid phase separation and increasing oxygen : carbon ratios of the organic aerosol components. We also observed indirect evidence for the dehydration-induced formation of highly viscous semi-solid phases and for kinetic limitations to the crystallization of ammonium sulfate at low RH for sucrose-containing particles. AIOMFAC-predicted growth curves are generally in good agreement with the HGF measurements. The performances of the simplified modeling approaches, however, differ for particles with differing phase states. This suggests that no single simplified modeling approach can be used to capture the water-uptake behavior for the diversity of particle-phase behavior expected in the atmosphere. Errors in HGFs calculated with the simplified models are of sufficient magnitude to produce substantial errors in estimates of particle optical and radiative properties, particularly for the assumption that water uptake is driven by absorptive equilibrium partitioning with ideal particle-phase mixing.

Precipitation effects of giant cloud condensation nuclei artificially introduced into stratocumulus clouds	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MARINE STRATOCUMULUS; WARM RAIN; HYGROSCOPIC FLARES; CONVECTIVE CLOUDS; MODEL; SIMULATION; BALANCE; RADAR	To study the effect of giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) on precipitation processes in stratocumulus clouds, 1-10 mu m diameter salt particles (salt powder) were released from an aircraft while flying near the cloud top on 3 August 2011 off the central coast of California. The seeded area was subsequently sampled from the aircraft that was equipped with aerosol, cloud, and precipitation probes and an upward-facing cloud radar. During post-seeding sampling, made 30-60 min after seeding, the mean cloud droplet size increased, the droplet number concentration decreased, and large drop (e.g., diameter larger than 10 mu m) concentration increased. Average drizzle rates increased from about 0.05 to 0.20 mm h(-1), and the liquid water path decreased from about 52 to 43 g m(-2). Strong radar returns associated with drizzle were observed on the post-seeding cloud-base level-leg flights and were accompanied by a substantial depletion of the cloud liquid water content. The changes were large enough to suggest that the salt particles with concentrations estimated to be 10(-2) to 10(-4) cm(-3) resulted in a four-fold increase in the cloud-base rainfall rate and depletion of the cloud water due to rainout. In contrast, a case is shown where the cloud was already precipitating (on 10 August) and the effect of adding GCCN to the cloud was insignificant.	[Jung, E.; Albrecht, B.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) from MIPAS in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere 2002-2012	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TRACE GAS MEASUREMENTS; GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; VOLCANIC SO2; ARCTIC TROPOSPHERE; MASS-SPECTROMETER; IASI MEASUREMENTS; POLLUTION PLUME; 2007 ERUPTION; AEROSOL; RETRIEVAL	Vertically resolved distributions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) with global coverage in the height region from the upper troposphere to 20 km altitude have been derived from observations by the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on Envisat for the period July 2002 to April 2012. Retrieved volume mixing ratio profiles representing single measurements are characterized by typical errors in the range of 70-100 pptv and by a vertical resolution ranging from 3 to 5 km. Comparison with observations by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) revealed a slightly varying bias with altitude of -20 to 50 pptv for the MIPAS data set in case of volcanically enhanced concentrations. For background concentrations the comparison showed a systematic difference between the two major MIPAS observation periods. After debiasing, the difference could be reduced to biases within -10 to 20 pptv in the altitude range of 10-20 km with respect to ACE-FTS. Further comparisons of the debiased MIPAS data set with in situ measurements from various aircraft campaigns showed no obvious inconsistencies within a range of around +/- 50 pptv. The SO2 emissions of more than 30 volcanic eruptions could be identified in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). Emitted SO2 masses and lifetimes within different altitude ranges in the UTLS have been derived for a large part of these eruptions. Masses are in most cases within estimations derived from other instruments. From three of the major eruptions within the MIPAS measurement period - Kasatochi in August 2008, Sarychev in June 2009 and Nabro in June 2011 - derived lifetimes of SO2 for the altitude ranges 10-14, 14-18 and 18-22 km are 13.3 +/- 2.1, 23.6 +/- 1.2 and 32.3 +/- 5.5 days respectively. By omitting periods with obvious volcanic influence we have derived background mixing ratio distributions of SO2. At 10 km altitude these indicate an annual cycle at northern mid- and high latitudes with maximum values in summer and an amplitude of about 30 pptv. At higher altitudes of about 16-18 km, enhanced mixing ratios of SO2 can be found in the regions of the Asian and the North American monsoons in summer - a possible connection to an aerosol layer discovered by Vernier et al. (2011b) in that region.

Estimating global and North American methane emissions with high spatial resolution using GOSAT satellite data	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							COLUMN-AVERAGED CH4; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; AIRCRAFT CAMPAIGN; GREENHOUSE GASES; MOLE FRACTION; CALIBRATION; SURFACE; CO2; SCIAMACHY	We use 2009-2011 space-borne methane observations from the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to estimate global and North American methane emissions with 4A degrees x 5A degrees and up to 50 km x 50 km spatial resolution, respectively. GEOS-Chem and GOSAT data are first evaluated with atmospheric methane observations from surface and tower networks (NOAA/ESRL, TCCON) and aircraft (NOAA/ESRL, HIPPO), using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model as a platform to facilitate comparison of GOSAT with in situ data. This identifies a high-latitude bias between the GOSAT data and GEOS-Chem that we correct via quadratic regression. Our global adjoint-based inversion yields a total methane source of 539 Tg a(-1) with some important regional corrections to the EDGARv4.2 inventory used as a prior. Results serve as dynamic boundary conditions for an analytical inversion of North American methane emissions using radial basis functions to achieve high resolution of large sources and provide error characterization. We infer a US anthropogenic methane source of 40.2-42.7 Tg a(-1), as compared to 24.9-27.0 Tg a(-1) in the EDGAR and EPA bottom-up inventories, and 30.0-44.5 Tg a(-1) in recent inverse studies. Our estimate is supported by independent surface and aircraft data and by previous inverse studies for California. We find that the emissions are highest in the southern-central US, the Central Valley of California, and Florida wetlands; large isolated point sources such as the US Four Corners also contribute. Using prior information on source locations, we attribute 29-44 % of US anthropogenic methane emissions to livestock, 22-31 % to oil/gas, 20 % to landfills/wastewater, and 11-15 % to coal. Wetlands contribute an additional 9.0-10.1 Tg a(-1).	[Turner, A. J.; Jacob, D. J.; Maasakkers, J. D.; Lundgren, E.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jacob, D.

Experimental investigation of ion-ion recombination under atmospheric conditions	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							STATE CHARGE-DISTRIBUTION; PARTICLE FORMATION EVENTS; AEROSOL NUCLEATION; SULFURIC-ACID; COSMIC-RAYS; AIR IONS; SPECTROMETER NAIS; LOWER TROPOSPHERE; NEUTRAL CLUSTER; CLOUD CHAMBER	We present the results of laboratory measurements of the ion-ion recombination coefficient at different temperatures, relative humidities and concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide. The experiments were carried out using the Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets (CLOUD) chamber at CERN, the walls of which are made of conductive material, making it possible to measure small ions. We produced ions in the chamber using a 3.5 GeV c(-1) beam of positively charged pions (pi(+)) generated by the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS). When the PS was switched off, galactic cosmic rays were the only ionization source in the chamber. The range of the ion production rate varied from 2 to 100 cm(-3) s(-1), covering the typical range of ionization throughout the troposphere. The temperature ranged from -55 to 20 degrees C, the relative humidity (RH) from 0 to 70 %, the SO2 concentration from 0 to 40 ppb, and the ozone concentration from 200 to 700 ppb. The best agreement of the retrieved ion-ion recombination coefficient with the commonly used literature value of 1.6 x 10(-6) cm(3) s(-1) was found at a temperature of 5 degrees C and a RH of 40% (1.5 +/- 0.6) x 10(-6) cm(3) s(-1). At 20 degrees C and 40% RH, the retrieved ion-ion recombination coefficient was instead (2.3 +/- 0.7) x 10(-6) cm(3) s(-1). We observed no dependency of the ion-ion recombination coefficient on ozone concentration and a weak variation with sulfur dioxide concentration. However, we observed a more than fourfold increase in the ion-ion recombination coefficient with decreasing temperature. We compared our results with three different models and found an overall agreement for temperatures above 0 degrees C, but a disagreement at lower temperatures. We observed a strong increase in the recombination coefficient for decreasing relative humidities, which has not been reported previously.

Past changes in the vertical distribution of ozone - Part 3: Analysis and interpretation of trends	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC OZONE; SAGE-II; TOTAL COLUMN; DATA SET; SATELLITE; VARIABILITY; PROFILES; CIRCULATION; STATIONS; LAYER	Trends in the vertical distribution of ozone are reported and compared for a number of new and recently revised data sets. The amount of ozone-depleting compounds in the stratosphere (as measured by equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine - EESC) was maximised in the second half of the 1990s. We examine the periods before and after the peak to see if any change in trend is discernible in the ozone record that might be attributable to a change in the EESC trend, though no attribution is attempted. Prior to 1998, trends in the upper stratosphere (similar to 45 km, 4 hPa) are found to be -5 to -10% per decade at mid-latitudes and closer to -5% per decade in the tropics. No trends are found in the mid-stratosphere (28 km, 30 hPa). Negative trends are seen in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and in the deep tropics. However, it is hard to be categorical about the trends in the lower stratosphere for three reasons: (i) there are fewer measurements, (ii) the data quality is poorer, and (iii) the measurements in the 1990s are perturbed by aerosols from the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991. These findings are similar to those reported previously even though the measurements for the main satellite and ground-based records have been revised. There is no sign of a continued negative trend in the upper stratosphere since 1998: instead there is a hint of an average positive trend of similar to 2% per decade in mid-latitudes and similar to 3% per decade in the tropics. The significance of these upward trends is investigated using different assumptions of the independence of the trend estimates found from different data sets. The averaged upward trends are significant if the trends derived from various data sets are assumed to be independent (as in Pawson et al., 2014) but are generally not significant if the trends are not independent. This occurs because many of the underlying measurement records are used in more than one merged data set. At this point it is not possible to say which assumption is best. Including an estimate of the drift of the overall ozone observing system decreases the significance of the trends. The significance will become clearer as (i) more years are added to the observational record, (ii) further improvements are made to the historic ozone record (e. g. through algorithm development), and (iii) the data merging techniques are refined, particularly through a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties.

Sources, seasonality, and trends of southeast US aerosol: an integrated analysis of surface, aircraft, and satellite observations with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; STABILIZED CRIEGEE INTERMEDIATE; SPECTRAL-RESOLUTION LIDAR; EASTERN UNITED-STATES; OPTICAL DEPTH; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; HUMIDITY DEPENDENCE; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL; VERTICAL PROFILES; TEMPORAL TRENDS	We use an ensemble of surface (EPA CSN, IMPROVE, SEARCH, AERONET), aircraft (SEAC(4)RS), and satellite (MODIS, MISR) observations over the southeast US during the summer-fall of 2013 to better understand aerosol sources in the region and the relationship between surface particulate matter (PM) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model (CTM) with 25 x 25 km(2) resolution over North America is used as a common platform to interpret measurements of different aerosol variables made at different times and locations. Sulfate and organic aerosol (OA) are the main contributors to surface PM2.5 (mass concentration of PM finer than 2.5 mu m aerodynamic diameter) and AOD over the southeast US. OA is simulated successfully with a simple parameterization, assuming irreversible uptake of low-volatility products of hydrocarbon oxidation. Biogenic isoprene and monoterpenes account for 60 % of OA, anthropogenic sources for 30 %, and open fires for 10 %. 60 % of total aerosol mass is in the mixed layer below 1.5 km, 25 % in the cloud convective layer at 1.5-3 km, and 15 % in the free troposphere above 3 km. This vertical profile is well captured by GEOS-Chem, arguing against a high-altitude source of OA. The extent of sulfate neutralization (f = [NH4+]/(2[SO42-] + [NO3-]) is only 0.5-0.7 mol mol(-1) in the observations, despite an excess of ammonia present, which could reflect suppression of ammonia uptake by OA. This would explain the long-term decline of ammonium aerosol in the southeast US, paralleling that of sulfate. The vertical profile of aerosol extinction over the southeast US follows closely that of aerosol mass. GEOS-Chem reproduces observed total column aerosol mass over the southeast US within 6 %, column aerosol extinction within 16 %, and space-based AOD within 8-28 % (consistently biased low). The large AOD decline observed from summer to winter is driven by sharp declines in both sulfate and OA from August to October. These declines are due to shutdowns in both biogenic emissions and UV-driven photochemistry. Surface PM2.5 shows far less summer-to-winter decrease than AOD and we attribute this in part to the offsetting effect of weaker boundary layer ventilation. The SEAC4RS aircraft data demonstrate that AODs measured from space are consistent with surface PM2.5. This implies that satellites can be used reliably to infer surface PM2.5 over monthly timescales if a good CTM representation of the aerosol vertical profile is available.	[Kim, P. S.; Jacob, D.

Thermodynamics of the formation of sulfuric acid dimers in the binary (H2SO4-H2O) and ternary (H2SO4-H2O-NH3) system	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PRENUCLEATION MOLECULAR CLUSTERS; ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOL NUCLEATION; IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETER; PARTICLE FORMATION; GAS-PHASE; UPPER TROPOSPHERE; CLOUD EXPERIMENT; PEM-TROPICS; ION; AMMONIA	Sulfuric acid is an important gas influencing atmospheric new particle formation (NPF). Both the binary (H2SO4-H2O) system and the ternary system involving ammonia (H2SO4-H2O-NH3) may be important in the free troposphere. An essential step in the nucleation of aerosol particles from gas-phase precursors is the formation of a dimer, so an understanding of the thermodynamics of dimer formation over a wide range of atmospheric conditions is essential to describe NPF. We have used the CLOUD chamber to conduct nucleation experiments for these systems at temperatures from 208 to 248 K. Neutral monomer and dimer concentrations of sulfuric acid were measured using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS). From these measurements, dimer evaporation rates in the binary system were derived for temperatures of 208 and 223 K. We compare these results to literature data from a previous study that was conducted at higher temperatures but is in good agreement with the present study. For the ternary system the formation of H2SO4 center dot NH3 is very likely an essential step in the formation of sulfuric acid dimers, which were measured at 210, 223, and 248 K. We estimate the thermodynamic properties (dH and dS) of the H2SO4 center dot NH3 cluster using a simple heuristic model and the measured data. Furthermore, we report the first measurements of large neutral sulfuric acid clusters containing as many as 10 sulfuric acid molecules for the binary system using chemical ionization-atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight (CI-APi-TOF) mass spectrometry.

Observation of isoprene hydroxynitrates in the southeastern United States and implications for the fate of NOx	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MULTIFUNCTIONAL ORGANIC NITRATES; NOCTURNAL BOUNDARY-LAYER; OH-INITIATED OXIDATION; AEROSOL FORMATION; NO3-INITIATED OXIDATION; PEROXY-RADICALS; ALKYL NITRATE; AIR-QUALITY; KINETICS; PRODUCT	Isoprene hydroxynitrates (IN) are tracers of the photochemical oxidation of isoprene in high NOx environments. Production and loss of IN have a significant influence on the NOx cycle and tropospheric O-3 chemistry. To better understand IN chemistry, a series of photochemical reaction chamber experiments was conducted to determine the IN yield from isoprene photooxidation at high NO concentrations (>100 ppt). By combining experimental data and calculated isomer distributions, a total IN yield of 9(+4/-3)% was derived. The result was applied in a zero-dimensional model to simulate production and loss of ambient IN observed in a temperate forest atmosphere, during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign, from 27 May to 11 July 2013. The 9% yield was consistent with the observed IN/(MVK+MACR) ratios observed during SOAS. By comparing field observations with model simulations, we identified NO as the limiting factor for ambient IN production during SOAS, but vertical mixing at dawn might also contribute (similar to 27 %) to IN dynamics. A close examination of isoprene's oxidation products indicates that its oxidation transitioned from a high-NO dominant chemical regime in the morning into a low-NO dominant regime in the afternoon. A significant amount of IN produced in the morning high NO regime could be oxidized in the low NO regime, and a possible reaction scheme was proposed.	[Xiong, F.; McAvey, K. M.; Pratt, K.

Sensitivity analysis of the potential impact of discrepancies in stratosphere-troposphere exchange on inferred sources and sinks of CO2	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							UPDATED EMISSIONS; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; VERTICAL PROFILES; REGIONAL CO2; GLOBAL CO2; IN-SITU; ACE-FTS; PART 1; MODEL; OZONE	The upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) represents a transition region between the more dynamically active troposphere and more stably stratified stratosphere. The region is characterized by strong gradients in the distribution of long-lived tracers, whose representation in models is sensitive to discrepancies in transport. We evaluate the GEOS-Chem model in the UTLS using carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (O-3) observations from the HIAPER (The High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaign in March 2010. GEOS-Chem CO2/O-3 correlation suggests that there is a discrepancy in mixing across the tropopause in the model, which results in an overestimate of CO2 and an underestimate of O-3 in the Arctic lower stratosphere. We assimilate stratospheric O-3 data from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) and use the assimilated O-3 fields together with the HIPPO CO2/O-3 correlations to obtain an adjustment to the modeled CO2 profile in the Arctic UTLS (primarily between the 320 and 360K isentropic surfaces). The HIPPO-derived adjustment corresponds to a sink of 0.60 Pg C for March-August 2010 in the Arctic. Imposing this adjustment results in a reduction in the CO2 sinks inferred from GOSAT observations for temperate North America, Europe, and tropical Asia of 19, 13, and 49 %, respectively. Conversely, the inversion increased the source of CO2 from tropical South America by 23 %. We find that the model also underestimates CO2 in the upper tropical and subtropical troposphere. Correcting for the underestimate in the model relative to HIPPO in the tropical upper troposphere leads to a reduction in the source from tropical South America by 77 %, and produces an estimated sink for tropical Asia that is only 19% larger than the standard inversion (without the imposed source and sink). Globally, the inversion with the Arctic and tropical adjustment produces a sink of -6.64 Pg C, which is consistent with the estimate of -6.65 Pg C in the standard inversion. However, the standard inversion produces a stronger northern land sink by 0.98 Pg C to account for the CO2 overestimate in the high-latitude UTLS, suggesting that this UTLS discrepancy can impact the latitudinal distribution of the inferred sources and sinks. We find that doubling the model resolution from 4 degrees x 5 degrees to 2 degrees x 2.5 degrees enhances the CO2 vertical gradient in the high-latitude UTLS, and reduces the overestimate in CO2 in the extratropical lower stratosphere. Our results illustrate that discrepancies in the CO2 distribution in the UTLS can affect CO2 flux inversions and suggest the need for more careful evaluation of model errors in the UTLS.

Characterization of a real-time tracer for isoprene epoxydiols-derived secondary organic aerosol (IEPOX-SOA) from aerosol mass spectrometer measurements	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CATALYZED REACTIVE UPTAKE; BIOMASS-BURNING SMOKE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; CHEMICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; SUBMICRON PARTICLES; PARTICULATE MATTER; EPOXIDE FORMATION; AMBIENT AEROSOL	Substantial amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) can be formed from isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX), which are oxidation products of isoprene mainly under low-NO conditions. Total IEPOX-SOA, which may include SOA formed from other parallel isoprene oxidation pathways, was quantified by applying positive matrix factorization (PMF) to aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements. The IEPOX-SOA fractions of organic aerosol (OA) in multiple field studies across several continents are summarized here and show consistent patterns with the concentration of gas-phase IEPOX simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. During the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS), 78% of PMF-resolved IEPOX-SOA is accounted by the measured IEPOX-SOA molecular tracers (2-methyltetrols, C5-Triols, and IEPOX-derived organosulfate and its dimers), making it the highest level of molecular identification of an ambient SOA component to our knowledge. An enhanced signal at C5H6O+ (m/z 82) is found in PMF-resolved IEPOX-SOA spectra. To investigate the suitability of this ion as a tracer for IEPOX-SOA, we examine fC(5)H(6)O (fC(5)H(6)O = C5H6O+ / OA) across multiple field, chamber, and source data sets. A background of similar to 1.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (parts per thousand = parts per thousand) is observed in studies strongly influenced by urban, biomass-burning, and other anthropogenic primary organic aerosol (POA). Higher background values of 3.1 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand are found in studies strongly influenced by monoterpene emissions. The average laboratory monoterpene SOA value (5.5 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand) is 4 times lower than the average for IEPOX-SOA (22 +/- 7 parts per thousand), which leaves some room to separate both contributions to OA. Locations strongly influenced by isoprene emissions under low-NO levels had higher fC(5)H(6)O (similar to 6.5 +/- 2.2 parts per thousand on average) than other sites, consistent with the expected IEPOX- SOA formation in those studies. fC(5)H(6)O in IEPOX- SOA is always elevated (12-40 parts per thousand) but varies substantially between locations, which is shown to reflect large variations in its detailed molecular composition. The low fC(5)H(6)O (< 3 parts per thousand) reported in non-IEPOX-derived isoprene-SOA from chamber studies indicates that this tracer ion is specifically enhanced from IEPOX- SOA, and is not a tracer for all SOA from isoprene. We introduce a graphical diagnostic to study the presence and aging of IEPOX- SOA as a triangle plot of f(CO2) vs. fC(5)H(6)O. Finally, we develop a simplified method to estimate ambient IEPOX- SOA mass concentrations, which is shown to perform well compared to the full PMF method. The uncertainty of the tracer method is up to a factor of similar to 2, if the fC(5)H(6)O of the local IEPOX- SOA is not available. When only unit mass-resolution data are available, as with the aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), all methods may perform less well because of increased interferences from other ions at m/z 82. This study clarifies the strengths and limitations of the different AMS methods for detection of IEPOX- SOA and will enable improved characterization of this OA component.	[Hu, W.

Global evaluation of ammonia bidirectional exchange and livestock diurnal variation schemes	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							BIOSPHERE-ATMOSPHERE EXCHANGE; AIR-QUALITY MODEL; UNITED-STATES; DATA ASSIMILATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION; TROPOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; PARTICULATE MATTER; WET DEPOSITION; EMISSIONS	Bidirectional air-surface exchange of ammonia (NH3) has been neglected in many air quality models. In this study, we implement the bidirectional exchange of NH3 in the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. We also introduce an updated diurnal variability scheme for NH3 livestock emissions and evaluate the recently developed MASAGE_NH3 bottom-up inventory. While updated diurnal variability improves comparison of modeled-to-hourly in situ measurements in the southeastern USA, NH3 concentrations decrease throughout the globe, up to 17 ppb in India and southeastern China, with corresponding decreases in aerosol nitrate by up to 7 mu g m(-3). The ammonium (NH4+) soil pool in the bidirectional exchange model largely extends the NH3 lifetime in the atmosphere. Including bidirectional exchange generally increases NH3 gross emissions (7.1 %) and surface concentrations (up to 3.9 ppb) throughout the globe in July, except in India and southeastern China. In April and October, it decreases NH3 gross emissions in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., 43.6 % in April in China) and increases NH3 gross emissions in the Southern Hemisphere. Bidirectional exchange does not largely impact NH4+ wet deposition overall. While bidirectional exchange is fundamentally a better representation of NH3 emissions from fertilizers, emissions from primary sources are still underestimated and thus significant model biases remain when compared to in situ measurements in the USA. The adjoint of bidirectional exchange has also been developed for the GEOS-Chem model and is used to investigate the sensitivity of NH3 concentrations with respect to soil pH and fertilizer application rate. This study thus lays the groundwork for future inverse modeling studies to more directly constrain these physical processes rather than tuning bulk unidirectional NH3 emissions.

Does GOSAT capture the true seasonal cycle of carbon dioxide?	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							CO2 RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; VOLUME MIXING RATIOS; COLUMN-AVERAGED CO2; GREENHOUSE GASES; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SPECTROSCOPIC OBSERVATIONS; TRANSPORT MODEL; X-CO2 DATA; SURFACE; VALIDATION	The seasonal cycle accounts for a dominant mode of total column CO2 (XCO2) annual variability and is connected to CO2 uptake and release; it thus represents an important quantity to test the accuracy of the measurements from space. We quantitatively evaluate the XCO2 seasonal cycle of the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) observations from the Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) retrieval system and compare average regional seasonal cycle features to those directly measured by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). We analyse the mean seasonal cycle amplitude, dates of maximum and minimum XCO2, as well as the regional growth rates in XCO2 through the fitted trend over several years. We find that GOSAT/ACOS captures the seasonal cycle amplitude within 1.0 ppm accuracy compared to TCCON, except in Europe, where the difference exceeds 1.0 ppm at two sites, and the amplitude captured by GOSAT/ACOS is generally shallower compared to TCCON. This bias over Europe is not as large for the other GOSAT retrieval algorithms (NIES v02.21, RemoTeC v2.35, UoL v5.1, and NIES PPDF-S v.02.11), al-though they have significant biases at other sites. We find that the ACOS bias correction partially explains the shallow amplitude over Europe. The impact of the co-location method and aerosol changes in the ACOS algorithm were also tested and found to be few tenths of a ppm and mostly non-systematic. We find generally good agreement in the date of minimum XCO2 between ACOS and TCCON, but ACOS generally infers a date of maximum XCO2 2-3 weeks later than TCCON. We further analyse the latitudinal dependence of the seasonal cycle amplitude throughout the Northern Hemisphere and compare the dependence to that predicted by current optimized models that assimilate in situ measurements of CO2. In the zonal averages, models are consistent with the GOSAT amplitude to within 1.4 ppm, depending on the model and latitude. We also show that the seasonal cycle of XCO2 depends on longitude especially at the mid-latitudes: the amplitude of GOSAT XCO2 doubles from western USA to East Asia at 45-50 degrees N, which is only partially shown by the models. In general, we find that model-to-model differences can be larger than GOSAT-to-model differences. These results suggest that GOSAT/ACOS retrievals of the XCO2 seasonal cycle may be sufficiently accurate to evaluate land surface models in regions with significant discrepancies between the models.

Organic nitrate aerosol formation via NO3 + biogenic volatile organic compounds in the southeastern United States	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; ENGLAND AIR-QUALITY; IN-SITU MEASUREMENT; MASS-SPECTROMETER; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; REACTIVE NITROGEN; ALPHA-PINENE; GAS; OXIDATION	Gas- and aerosol-phase measurements of oxidants, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and organic nitrates made during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS campaign, Summer 2013) in central Alabama show that a nitrate radical (NO3) reaction with monoterpenes leads to significant secondary aerosol formation. Cumulative losses of NO3 to terpenes are correlated with increase in gas- and aerosol- organic nitrate concentrations made during the campaign. Correlation of NO3 radical consumption to organic nitrate aerosol formation as measured by aerosol mass spectrometry and thermal dissociation laser-induced fluorescence suggests a molar yield of aerosol-phase monoterpene nitrates of 23-44 %. Compounds observed via chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) are correlated to predicted nitrate loss to BVOCs and show C10H17NO5, likely a hydroperoxy nitrate, is a major nitrate-oxidized terpene product being incorporated into aerosols. The comparable isoprene product C5H9NO5 was observed to contribute less than 1% of the total organic nitrate in the aerosol phase and correlations show that it is principally a gas-phase product from nitrate oxidation of isoprene. Organic nitrates comprise between 30 and 45% of the NOy budget during SOAS. Inorganic nitrates were also monitored and showed that during incidents of increased coarse-mode mineral dust, HNO3 uptake produced nitrate aerosol mass loading at a rate comparable to that of organic nitrate produced via NO3 + BVOCs.

Observations of volcanic SO2 from MLS on Aura	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO; SULFUR-DIOXIDE; RETRIEVAL; ERUPTION	Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important atmospheric constituent, particularly in the aftermath of volcanic eruptions. These events can inject large amounts of SO2 into the lower stratosphere, where it is oxidised to form sulfate aerosols; these in turn have a significant effect on the climate. The MLS instrument on the Aura satellite has observed the SO2 mixing ratio in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere from August 2004 to the present, during which time a number of volcanic eruptions have significantly affected those regions of the atmosphere. We describe the MLS SO2 data and how various volcanic events appear in the data. As the MLS SO2 data are currently not validated we take some initial steps towards their validation. First we establish the level of internal consistency between the three spectral regions in which MLS is sensitive to SO2. We compare SO2 column values calculated from MLS data to total column values reported by the OMI instrument. The agreement is good (within about 1 DU) in cases where the SO2 is clearly at altitudes above 147 hPa.	[Pumphrey, H. C.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Read, W.

Global-scale remote sensing of water isotopologues in the troposphere: representation of first-order isotope effects	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							DELTA-D; EMISSION SPECTROMETER; VAPOR ISOTOPOLOGUES; HDO MEASUREMENTS; STABLE-ISOTOPES; SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS; HDO/H2O RATIOS; CIRCULATION; RETRIEVALS; DEUTERIUM	Over the last decade, global-scale data sets of atmospheric water vapor isotopologues (HDO) have become available from different remote sensing instruments. Due to the observational geometry and the spectral ranges that are used, few satellites sample water isotopologues in the lower troposphere, where the bulk of hydrological processes within the atmosphere take place. Here, we compare three satellite HDO data sets, two from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES retrieval version 4 and 5) and one from SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY), with results from the atmospheric global circulation model ECHAM4 (European Centre HAMburg 4). We examine a list of known isotopologue effects to qualitatively benchmark the various observational data sets. TES version 5 (TESV5), TES version 4 (TESV4), SCIAMACHY, ECHAM, and ECHAM convolved with averaging kernels of TES version 5 (ECHAM(AK5)) successfully reproduced a number of established isotopologue effects such as the latitude effect, the amount effect, and the continental effect. The improvement of TESV5 over TESV4 is confirmed by the steeper latitudinal gradient at higher latitudes in agreement with SCIAMACHY. Also the representation of other features of the water isotopologue cycle, such as the seasonally varying signal in the tropics due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), is improved in TESV5 and SCIAMACHY compared to TESV4. A known humidity bias due to the cross correlation of H2O and HDO measurements, which is of particular importance for instruments with low sensitivity close to the surface, was analyzed by applying either a humidity bias correction or a suitable a posteriori analysis. We suggest that the qualitative and quantitative tests carried out in this study could become benchmark tests for evaluation of future satellite isotopologue data sets.	[Sutanto, S.

Potential of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor for the monitoring of terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; GREEN LAI; VEGETATION; RETRIEVAL; INDEX; SPECTROSCOPY; LEAF; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SCATTERING; RESOLUTION	Global monitoring of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is improving our knowledge about the photosynthetic functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. The feasibility of SIF retrievals from spaceborne atmospheric spectrometers has been demonstrated by a number of studies in the last years. In this work, we investigate the potential of the upcoming TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite mission for SIF retrieval. TROPOMI will sample the 675-775 nm spectral window with a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm and a pixel size of 7 km x 7 km. We use an extensive set of simulated TROPOMI data in order to assess the uncertainty of single SIF retrievals and subsequent spatio-temporal composites. Our results illustrate the enormous improvement in SIF monitoring achievable with TROPOMI with respect to comparable spectrometers currently in-flight, such as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instrument. We find that TROPOMI can reduce global uncertainties in SIF mapping by more than a factor of 2 with respect to GOME-2, which comes together with an approximately 5-fold improvement in spatial sampling. Finally, we discuss the potential of TROPOMI to map other important vegetation parameters at a global scale with moderate spatial resolution and short revisit time. Those include leaf photosynthetic pigments and proxies for canopy structure, which will complement SIF retrievals for a self-contained description of vegetation condition and functioning.

Consistent satellite XCO2 retrievals from SCIAMACHY and GOSAT using the BESD algorithm	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC CO2; VALIDATION; SPACE; CALIBRATION; SPECTROMETER; PERFORMANCE; EMISSIONS; ERRORS	Consistent and accurate long-term data sets of global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are required for carbon cycle and climate-related research. However, global data sets based on satellite observations may suffer from inconsistencies originating from the use of products derived from different satellites as needed to cover a long enough time period. One reason for inconsistencies can be the use of different retrieval algorithms. We address this potential issue by applying the same algorithm, the Bremen Optimal Estimation DOAS (BESD) algorithm, to different satellite instruments, SCIAMACHY on-board ENVISAT (March 2002-April 2012) and TANSO-FTS onboard GOSAT (launched in January 2009), to retrieve XCO2, the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2. BESD has been initially developed for SCIAMACHY XCO2 retrievals. Here, we present the first detailed assessment of the new GOSAT BESD XCO2 product. GOSAT BESD XCO2 is a product generated and delivered to the MACC project for assimilation into ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System. We describe the modifications of the BESD algorithm needed in order to retrieve XCO2 from GOSAT and present de-tailed comparisons with ground-based observations of XCO2 from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). We discuss detailed comparison results between all three XCO2 data sets (SCIAMACHY, GOSAT and TCCON). The comparison results demonstrate the good consistency between SCIAMACHY and GOSAT XCO2. For example, we found a mean difference for daily averages of -0.60 +/- 1.56 ppm (mean difference +/- standard deviation) for GOSAT-SCIAMACHY (linear correlation coefficient r = 0.82), -0.34 +/- 1.37 ppm (r = 0.86) for GOSAT-TCCON and 0.10 +/- 1.79 ppm (r = 0.75) for SCIAMACHY-TCCON. The remaining differences between GOSAT and SCIAMACHY are likely due to non-perfect collocation (+/- 2 h, 10 degrees x 10 degrees around TCCON sites), i.e. the observed air masses are not exactly identical but likely also due to a still non-perfect BESD retrieval algorithm, which will be continuously improved in the future. Our overarching goal is to generate a satellite-derived XCO2 data set appropriate for climate and carbon cycle research covering the longest possible time period. We therefore also plan to extend the existing SCIAMACHY and GOSAT data set discussed here by also using data from other missions (e.g. OCO-2, GOSAT-2, CarbonSat) in the future.

Quantifying lower tropospheric methane concentrations using GOSAT near-IR and TES thermal IR measurements	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							EMISSION SPECTROMETER; AURA TES; CARBON; RETRIEVALS; CH4; VALIDATION; RESOLUTION; MAGNITUDE; TRANSPORT; PROFILES	Evaluating surface fluxes of CH4 using total column data requires models to accurately account for the transport and chemistry of methane in the free troposphere and stratosphere, thus reducing sensitivity to the underlying fluxes. Vertical profiles of methane have increased sensitivity to surface fluxes because lower tropospheric methane is more sensitive to surface fluxes than a total column, and quantifying free-tropospheric CH4 concentrations helps to evaluate the impact of transport and chemistry uncertainties on estimated surface fluxes. Here we demonstrate the potential for estimating lower tropospheric CH4 concentrations through the combination of free-tropospheric methane measurements from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and XCH4 (dry-mole air fraction of methane) from the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite - Thermal And Near-infrared for carbon Observation (GOSAT TANSO, herein GOSAT for brevity). The calculated precision of these estimates ranges from 10 to 30 ppb for a monthly average on a 4 degrees x 5 degrees latitude/longitude grid making these data suitable for evaluating lower-tropospheric methane concentrations. Smoothing error is approximately 10 ppb or less. Comparisons between these data and the GEOS-Chem model demonstrate that these lower-tropospheric CH4 estimates can resolve enhanced concentrations over flux regions that are challenging to resolve with total column measurements. We also use the GEOS-Chem model and surface measurements in background regions across a range of latitudes to determine that these lower-tropospheric estimates are biased low by approximately 65 ppb, with an accuracy of approximately 6 ppb (after removal of the bias) and an actual precision of approximately 30 ppb. This 6 ppb accuracy is consistent with the accuracy of TES and GOSAT methane retrievals.	[Worden, J. R.; Bloom, A.; Liu, J.; Lee, M.; Weidner, R.; Bowman, K.; Frankenberg, C.; Payne, V.

Development and characterisation of a state-of-the-art GOME-2 formaldehyde air-mass factor algorithm	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							SURFACE REFLECTANCE ANISOTROPY; TROPOSPHERIC NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTIONS; NO2 COLUMN RETRIEVAL; ISOPRENE EMISSIONS; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; OMI OBSERVATIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; OZONE; AEROSOLS	Space-borne observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) are frequently used to derive surface emissions of isoprene, an important biogenic volatile organic compound. The conversion of retrieved HCHO slant column concentrations from satellite line-of-sight measurements to vertical columns is determined through application of an air mass factor (AMF), accounting for instrument viewing geometry, radiative transfer, and vertical profile of the absorber in the atmosphere. This step in the trace gas retrieval is subject to large errors. This work presents the AMF algorithm in use at the University of Leicester (UoL), which introduces scene-specific variables into a per-observation full radiative transfer AMF calculation, including increasing spatial resolution of key environmental parameter databases, input variable area weighting, instrument-specific scattering weight calculation, and inclusion of an ozone vertical profile climatology. Application of these updates to HCHO slant columns from the GOME-2 instrument is shown to typically adjust the AMF by +/- 20 %, compared to a reference algorithm without these advanced parameterisations. On average the GOME-2 AMFs increase by 4 %, with over 70% of locations having an AMF of 0-20% larger than originally, largely resulting from the use of the latest GOME-2 reflectance product. Furthermore, the new UoL algorithm also incorporates a full radiative transfer error calculation for each scene to help characterise AMF uncertainties. Global median AMF errors are typically 50-60 %, and are driven by uncertainties in the HCHO profile shape and its vertical distribution relative to clouds and aerosols. If uncertainty on the a priori HCHO profile is relatively small (< 10 %) then the median AMF total error decreases to about 30-40 %.	[Hewson, W.; Barkley, M.

Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite observations of ammonia, methanol, formic acid, and carbon monoxide over the Canadian oil sands: validation and model evaluation	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; ACETIC-ACIDS; GLOBAL DISTRIBUTIONS; RETRIEVAL ALGORITHM; DAILY MORTALITY; ORGANIC-ACIDS; TRACE GASES; EXCHANGE; INSTRUMENT; NH3	The wealth of air quality information provided by satellite infrared observations of ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), and methanol (CH3OH) is currently being explored and used for a number of applications, especially at regional or global scales. These applications include air quality monitoring, trend analysis, emissions, and model evaluation. This study provides one of the first direct validations of Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) satellite-retrieved profiles of NH3, CH3OH, and HCOOH through comparisons with coincident aircraft profiles. The comparisons are performed over the Canadian oil sands region during the intensive field campaign (August-September, 2013) in support of the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring (JOSM). The satellite/aircraft comparisons over this region during this period produced errors of (i) +0.08 +/- 0.25 ppbv for NH3, (ii) +7.5 +/- 23 ppbv for CO, (iii) +0.19 +/- 0.46 ppbv for HCOOH, and (iv) 1.1 +/- 0.39 ppbv for CH3OH. These values mostly agree with previously estimated retrieval errors; however, the relatively large negative bias in CH3OH and the significantly greater positive bias for larger HCOOH and CO values observed during this study warrant further investigation. Satellite and aircraft ammonia observations during the field campaign are also used in an initial effort to perform preliminary evaluations of Environment Canada's Global Environmental Multi-scale-Modelling Air quality and CHemistry (GEM-MACH) air quality modelling system at high resolution (2.5 +/- 2.5 km(2). These initial results indicate a model underprediction of similar to 0.6 ppbv (similar to 60 %) for NH3, during the field campaign period. The TES/model CO comparison differences are similar to+20 ppbv (similar to +20 %), but given that under these conditions the TES/aircraft comparisons also show a small positive TES CO bias indicates that the overall model underprediction of CO is closer to similar to 10% at 681 hPa (similar to 3 km) during this period.

Constraining ecosystem carbon dynamics in a data-limited world: integrating ecological "common sense" in a model-data fusion framework	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; DATA ASSIMILATION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; EDDY COVARIANCE; BOREAL FOREST; WATER-VAPOR; OLD-GROWTH; DIOXIDE; CYCLE; VEGETATION	Many of the key processes represented in global terrestrial carbon models remain largely unconstrained. For instance, plant allocation patterns and residence times of carbon pools are poorly known globally, except perhaps at a few intensively studied sites. As a consequence of data scarcity, carbon models tend to be underdetermined, and so can produce similar net fluxes with very different parameters and internal dynamics. To address these problems, we propose a series of ecological and dynamic constraints (EDCs) on model parameters and initial conditions, as a means to constrain ecosystem variable inter-dependencies in the absence of local data. The EDCs consist of a range of conditions on (a) carbon pool turnover and allocation ratios, (b) steady-state proximity, and (c) growth and decay of model carbon pools. We use a simple ecosystem carbon model in a model-data fusion framework to determine the added value of these constraints in a data-poor context. Based only on leaf area index (LAI) time series and soil carbon data, we estimate net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for (a) 40 synthetic experiments and (b) three AmeriFlux tower sites. For the synthetic experiments, we show that EDCs lead to an overall 34% relative error reduction in model parameters, and a 65% reduction in the 3 yr NEE 90% confidence range. In the application at AmeriFlux sites all NEE estimates were made independently of NEE measurements. Compared to these observations, EDCs resulted in a 69-93% reduction in 3 yr cumulative NEE median biases (-0.26 to +0.08 kg Cm-2), in comparison to standard 3 yr median NEE biases (-1.17 to -0.84 kgCm(2)). In light of these findings, we advocate the use of EDCs in future model-data fusion analyses of the terrestrial carbon cycle.	[Bloom, A.

However, regardless of the technology used, signals recorded by these electrodes degrade overtime. The failure mechanisms of these electrodes are understood to be a complex combination of the biological reactive tissue response and material failure of the device over time. While mechanical mismatch between the brain tissue and implanted neural electrodes have been studied as a source of chronic inflammation and performance degradation, the electrode failure caused by mechanical mismatch between different material properties and different structural components within a device have remained poorly characterized. Using Finite Element Model (FEM) we simulate the mechanical strain on a planar silicon electrode. The results presented here demonstrate that mechanical mismatch between iridium and silicon leads to concentrated strain along the border of the two materials. This strain is further focused on small protrusions such as the electrical traces in planar silicon electrodes. These findings are confirmed with chronic in vivo data (133-189 days) in mice by correlating a combination of single-unit electrophysiology, evoked multi-unit recordings, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy from traces and electrode sites with our modeling data. Several modes of mechanical failure of chronically implanted planar silicon electrodes are found that result in degradation and/or loss of recording. These findings highlight the importance of strains and material properties of various subcomponents within an electrode array. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kozai, Takashi D.

The material is an emulsified combination of artificial eccrine and sebaceous components designed to mimic the chemical profile of a latent fingerprint. In order to deposit this material in a manner that resembles a latent fingerprint, an artificial fingerprint stamp, created using 3-D printing, was used. Development of this material was spurred by the inability to cross-compare mass spectrometric techniques using real fingerprint deposits because of their inherent heterogeneity. To determine how well this material mimicked the chemical composition of actual fingerprint deposits, ambient ionization mass spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry techniques were used to compare the signatures of the artificial and real fingerprint deposits. Chemical imaging comparisons of the artificial fingerprints across different imaging platforms are also presented as well as a comparison using fingerprint development agents. The use of a material such as this may provide a way to compare the capabilities of different techniques in analyzing a sample as complex as a fingerprint as well as providing a method to create fingerprints with controlled amounts of exogenous material for research and technique validation purposes.

Platinum-decorated carbon nanotubes for hydrogen oxidation and proton reduction in solid acid electrochemical cells	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							FUEL-CELLS; NANOPARTICLES; CATALYSTS; PERFORMANCE; DEPOSITION	Pt-decorated carbon nanotubes ( Pt-CNTs) were used to enhance proton reduction and hydrogen evolution in solid acid electrochemical cells based on the proton-conducting electrolyte CsH2PO4. The carbon nanotubes served as interconnects to the current collector and as a platform for interaction between the Pt and CsH2PO4, ensuring minimal catalyst isolation and a large number density of active sites. Particle size matching was achieved by using electrospray deposition to form sub-micron to nanometric CsH2PO4. A porous composite electrode was fabricated from electrospray deposition of a solution of Pt-CNTs and CsH2PO4. Using AC impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, the total electrode overpotential corresponding to proton reduction and hydrogen oxidation of the most active electrodes containing just 0.014 mg cm (-1) of Pt was found to be 0.1 V ( or 0.05 V per electrode) at a current density of 42 mA cm - 2 for a measurement temperature of 240 C and a hydrogen- steam atmosphere. The zero bias electrode impedance was 1.2 U cm2, corresponding to a Pt utilization of 61 S mg 1, a 3- fold improvement over state- of- the- art electrodes with a 50 decrease in Pt loading.

However, several reports show that hardly any Ni remains in the layers of the catalysts close to the surface ("Pt-skin effect"). This paradox that Ni is essential to the high catalytic activity with the peak ORR activity at Pt3Ni7 while little or no Ni remains close to the surface is explained here using large-scale first-principles-based simulations. We make the radical assumption that processing Pt-Ni catalysts under ORR conditions would leach out all Ni accessible to the solvent. To simulate this process we use the ReaxFF reactive force field, starting with random alloy particles ranging from 50% Ni to 90% Ni and containing up to similar to 300 000 atoms, deleting the Ni atoms, and equilibrating the resulting structures. We find that the Pt3Ni7 case and a final particle radius around 7.5 nm lead to internal voids in communication with the exterior, doubling the external surface footprint, in fair agreement with experiment. Then we examine the surface character of these nanoporous systems and find that a prominent feature in the surface of the de-alloyed particles is a rhombic structure involving 4 surface atoms which is crystalline-like but under-coordinated. Using density-functional theory, we calculate the energy barriers of ORR steps on Pt nanoporous catalysts, focusing on the O-ad-hydration reaction (O-ad + H2Oad -> OHad + OHad) but including the barriers of O-2 dissociation (O-2ad -> O-ad + O-ad) and water formation (O-Had + H-ad -> H-2Oad). We find that the reaction barrier for the Oad-hydration rate-determining-step is reduced significantly on the de-alloyed surface sites compared to Pt(111). Moreover we find that these active sites are prevalent on the surface of particles de-alloyed from a Pt-Ni 30 : 70 initial composition. These simulations explain the peak in surface reactivity at Pt3Ni7, and provide a rational guide to use for further optimization of improved catalytic and nanoporous materials.

Independent evaluation of the SNODAS snow depth product using regional-scale lidar-derived measurements	CRYOSPHERE			English	Article							WATER EQUIVALENT; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; UPPER TREELINE; ARCTIC ALASKA; MODEL; WIND; REDISTRIBUTION; MOUNTAINS; PATTERNS; FOREST	Repeated light detection and ranging (lidar) surveys are quickly becoming the de facto method for measuring spatial variability of montane snowpacks at high resolution. This study examines the potential of a 750 km(2) lidar-derived data set of snow depths, collected during the 2007 northern Colorado Cold Lands Processes Experiment (CLPX-2), as a validation source for an operational hydrologic snow model. The SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) model framework, operated by the US National Weather Service, combines a physically based energy-and-mass-balance snow model with satellite, airborne and automated ground-based observations to provide daily estimates of snowpack properties at nominally 1 km resolution over the conterminous United States. Independent validation data are scarce due to the assimilating nature of SNODAS, compelling the need for an independent validation data set with substantial geographic coverage. Within 12 distinctive 500 x 500m study areas located throughout the survey swath, ground crews performed approximately 600 manual snow depth measurements during each of the CLPX-2 lidar acquisitions. This supplied a data set for constraining the uncertainty of upscaled lidar estimates of snow depth at the 1 km SNODAS resolution, resulting in a root-mean-square difference of 13 cm. Upscaled lidar snow depths were then compared to the SNODAS estimates over the entire study area for the dates of the lidar flights. The remotely sensed snow depths provided a more spatially continuous comparison data set and agreed more closely to the model estimates than that of the in situ measurements alone. Finally, the results revealed three distinct areas where the differences between lidar observations and SNODAS estimates were most drastic, providing insight into the causal influences of natural processes on model uncertainty.

Location of Ge and extra-framework species in the zeolite ITQ-24	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							PREFERENTIAL LOCATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; PURE SILICA; GERMANIUM; POLYMORPH; FLUORIDE	The germanosilicate ITQ-24 (IWR framework type) was synthesized in fluoride medium using 1,3,5-tris-(1,2-dimethylimidazolium) benzene as the structure directing agent (SDA). A structure analysis of the as-synthesized ITQ-24 material using synchrotron powder diffraction data and difference electron density calculations have allowed the fluoride ions and the germanium atoms to be located and the conformation of the SDA to be determined. The benzyl ring is perpendicular to the b axis with the three imidazolium moieties forming a "T-shaped" arrangement. Ge atoms replace some of the Si in the double-4-ring (d4r) and in one of the single-4-rings (s4r). The other s4r contains only Si. Fluoride ions are in the d4r units. Initially, the space group Cmmm (highest possible symmetry) was assumed, but the framework geometry was strained. An independent evaluation of the symmetry using the powder charge flipping algorithm in Superflip led to a successful refinement with reasonable geometry and a refined composition of vertical bar[(C6H3)(C(7)H(10)N2)(3)](2)F-2 vertical bar[Si40.2Ge15.8O112] in the space group Pban.

High temperature electronic and thermal transport measurements were used to characterize the thermoelectric properties of Yb5M2Sb6 compounds. All samples were found to exhibit similar high p-type carrier concentrations, low resistivity and low Seebeck coefficients in agreement with the band structure calculations. These results, combined with previous studies, suggest that Yb5M2Sb6 compounds are semi-metals (i.e., they lack an energy gap between the valence and conduction bands), in contrast to the semi-conducting alkaline earth (Ca, Sr, Ba) and Eu based A(5)M(2)Sb(6) compounds. Yb5M2Sb6 compounds have very low lattice thermal conductivity, comparable to other closely related A(5)M(2)Sb(6) and A(3)MSb(3) phases. However, due to the semimetallic behaviour, the figure of merit of investigated samples remains low (zT < 0.15).	[Aydemir, Umut; Wang, Heng; Ohno, Saneyuki; Snyder, G.

At room temperature, the reaction between 1 in CH3NO2 and AB in tetraglyme leads to Pd nanoparticles and formation of spent fuels of the general formula MeNHxBOy as reaction byproducts, while 2 equiv. of H-2 is efficiently released per AB equiv. at room temperature within 60 seconds. For a mechanistic understanding of dehydrogenation by 1, the chemical structures of spent fuels were intensely characterized by a series of analyses such as elemental analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR spectra (H-2, C-13, N-15, and B-11), and cross polarization (CP) MAS methods. During AB dehydrogenation, the involvement of MeNO2 in the spent fuels showed that the mechanism of dehydrogenation catalyzed by 1 is different from that found in the previously reported results. This AB dehydrogenation derived from MeNO2 is supported by a subsequent digestion experiment of the AB spent fuel: B(OMe)(3) and N-methyl-hydroxylamine ([Me(OH)N](2)CH2), which are formed by the methanolysis of the AB spent fuel (MeNHxBOy), were identified by means of B-11 NMR and single crystal structural analysis, respectively. A similar catalytic behavior was also observed in the AB dehydrogenation catalyzed by a nickel catalyst, [Ni(MeCN)(6)][BF4](2) (2).

Herein, we report, for the first time, that maricite NaFePO4 can function as an excellent cathode material for Na ion batteries, an unexpected result since it has been regarded as an electrochemically inactive electrode for rechargeable batteries. Our investigation of the Na re-(de)intercalation mechanism reveals that all Na ions can be deintercalated from the nano-sized maricite NaFePO4 with simultaneous transformation into amorphous FePO4. Our quantum mechanics calculations show that the underlying reason for the remarkable electrochemical activity of NaFePO4 is the significantly enhanced Na mobility in the transformed phase, which is similar to one fourth of the hopping activation barrier. Maricite NaFePO4, fully sodiated amorphous FePO4, delivered a capacity of 142 mA h g(-1) (92% of the theoretical value) at the first cycle, and showed outstanding cyclability with a negligible capacity fade after 200 cycles (95% retention of the initial cycle).

Currently, the understanding of semiconductor/liquid interfaces is inferred from experiments and models. Operando ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) has been used herein to directly characterize the semiconductor/liquid junction at room temperature under real-time electrochemical control. X-ray synchrotron radiation in conjunction with AP-XPS has enabled simultaneous monitoring of the solid surface, the solid/electrolyte interface, and the bulk electrolyte of a PEC cell as a function of the applied potential, U. The observed shifts in binding energy with respect to the applied potential have directly revealed ohmic and rectifying junction behavior on metallized and semiconducting samples, respectively. Additionally, the non-linear response of the core level binding energies to changes in the applied electrode potential has revealed the influence of defect-derived electronic states on the Galvani potential across the complete cell.

Structure of the high voltage phase of layered P2-Na2/3-z[Mn1/2Fe1/2]O-2 and the positive effect of Ni substitution on its stability	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							X LESS-THAN; CATHODE MATERIAL; ELECTROCHEMICAL INTERCALATION; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; ION BATTERIES; HIGH-CAPACITY; SODIUM; P2-TYPE; DEINTERCALATION; INSERTION	A combination of operando X-ray diffraction, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis coupled with electrochemical measurements and Mossbauer spectroscopy elucidates the nature of the phase transitions induced by insertion and extraction of sodium ions in P2-Na-0.67[NiyMn0.5+yFe0.5-2y]O-2 (y = 0, 0.10, 0.15). When phase transitions are avoided, the optimal cathode material - P2-Na0.67Fe0.2Mn0.65Ni0.15O2 - delivers 25% more energy than the unsubstituted material, sustaining high specific energy (350 Wh kg(-1)) at moderate rates and maintains 80% of the original energy density after 150 cycles - a significant improvement in performance vs. the unsubstituted analogue. The crystal structure of the high voltage phase is solved for the first time by X-ray PDF analysis of P2-Na0.67-zFe0.5Mn0.5O2 (where z similar to 0.5), revealing that migration of the transition metals - particularly Fe3+ - into tetrahedral sites in the interlayer space occurs at high potential. This results in new short range order between two adjacent layers. Although the transition metal migration is reversible as proven by electrochemical performance, it induces a large disfavourable cell polarization. The deleterious high voltage transition is mitigated by substitution of Fe3+ by Mn4+/Ni2+, giving rise to better cycling performance. Moreover, as demonstrated by Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, the much lower ratio of Fe4+O6 to Fe3+O6 observed systematically across the range of Ni content - compared to the values expected from a purely ionic model - suggests redox activity involves the O-2p orbitals owing to their overlap with the transition metal-3d orbitals.

An electrochemical engineering assessment of the operational conditions and constraints for solar-driven water-splitting systems at near-neutral pH	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							INTEGRATED PHOTOELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM; EARTH-ABUNDANT CATALYSTS; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; POLYMER ELECTROLYTE; OXYGEN EVOLUTION; THIN-FILM; EFFICIENCY; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; PHOTOLYSIS	The solution transport losses in a one-dimensional solar-driven water-splitting cell that operates in either concentrated acid, dilute acid, or buffered near-neutral pH electrolytes have been evaluated using a mathematical model that accounts for diffusion, migration and convective transport, as well as for bulk electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte. The Ohmic resistance loss, the Nernstian potential loss associated with pH gradients at the surface of the electrode, and electrodialysis in different electrolytes were assessed quantitatively in a stagnant cell as well as in a bubble-convected cell, in which convective mixing occurred due to product-gas evolution. In a stagnant cell that did not have convective mixing, small limiting current densities (<3 mA cm(-2)) and significant polarization losses derived from pH gradients were present in dilute acid as well as in near-neutral pH buffered electrolytes. In contrast, bubble-convected cells exhibited a significant increase in the limiting current density, and a significant reduction of the concentration overpotentials. In a bubble-convected cell, minimal solution transport losses were present in membrane-free cells, in either buffered electrolytes or in unbuffered solutions with pH <= 1. However, membrane-free cells lack a mechanism for product-gas separation, presenting significant practical and engineering impediments to the deployment of such systems. To produce an intrinsically safe cell, an ion-exchange membrane was incorporated into the cell. The accompanying solution losses, especially the pH gradients at the electrode surfaces, were modeled and simulated for such a system. Hence this work describes the general conditions under which intrinsically safe, efficient solar-driven water-splitting cells can be operated.

Functional integration of Ni-Mo electrocatalysts with Si microwire array photocathodes to simultaneously achieve high fill factors and light-limited photocurrent densities for solar-driven hydrogen evolution	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS; RADIAL JUNCTION; WATER; EFFICIENT; PHOSPHIDE; CATALYST	An n(+)p-Si microwire array coupled with a two-layer catalyst film consisting of Ni-Mo nanopowder and TiO2 light-scattering nanoparticles has been used to simultaneously achieve high fill factors and light-limited photocurrent densities from photocathodes that produce H-2(g) directly from sunlight and water. The TiO2 layer scattered light back into the Si microwire array, while optically obscuring the underlying Ni-Mo catalyst film. In turn, the Ni-Mo film had a mass loading sufficient to produce high catalytic activity, on a geometric area basis, for the hydrogen-evolution reaction. The best-performing microwire array devices prepared in this work exhibited short-circuit photocurrent densities of -14.3 mA cm(-2), photovoltages of 420 mV, and a fill factor of 0.48 under 1 Sun of simulated solar illumination, whereas the equivalent planar Ni-Mo-coated Si device, without TiO2 scatterers, exhibited negligible photocurrent due to complete light blocking by the Ni-Mo catalyst layer.

A monolithically integrated, intrinsically safe, 10% efficient, solar-driven water-splitting system based on active, stable earth-abundant electrocatalysts in conjunction with tandem III-V light absorbers protected by amorphous TiO2 films	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR PHOTOELECTRODE ARRAYS; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; CELL; PHOTOANODES; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; DEVICE; ELECTROLYSIS; OXIDATION; LAYER	A monolithically integrated device consisting of a tandem-junction GaAs/InGaP photoanode coated by an amorphous TiO2 stabilization layer, in conjunction with Ni-based, earth-abundant active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen-evolution and oxygen-evolution reactions, was used to effect unassisted, solar-driven water splitting in 1.0 M KOH(aq). When connected to a Ni-Mo-coated counter-electrode in a two-electrode cell configuration, the TiO2-protected III-V tandem device exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, eta STH, of 10.5% under 1 sun illumination, with stable performance for >40 h of continuous operation at an efficiency of gSTH > 10%. The protected tandem device also formed the basis for a monolithically integrated, intrinsically safe solar-hydrogen prototype system (1 cm(2)) driven by a NiMo/GaAs/InGaP/TiO2/Ni structure. The intrinsically safe system exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 0.81 mu L s(-1) and a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 8.6% under 1 sun illumination in 1.0 M KOH(aq), with minimal product gas crossover while allowing for beneficial collection of separate streams of H-2(g) and O-2(g).

One of the main goals of this programme is to study the relation between the radio and gamma-ray emission in blazars and to use it as a tool to locate the site of high energy emission. Using this large sample of objects we are able to characterize the radio variability, and study the significance of correlations between the radio and gamma-ray bands. We find that the radio variability of many sources can be described using a simple power law power spectral density, and that when taking into account the red-noise characteristics of the light curves, cases with significant correlation are rare. We note that while significant correlations are found in few individual objects, radio variations are most often delayed with respect to the gamma-ray variations. This suggests that the gamma-ray emission originates upstream of the radio emission. Because strong flares in most known gamma-ray-loud blazars are infrequent, longer light curves are required to settle the issue of the strength of radio-gamma cross-correlations and establish confidently possible delays between the two. For this reason continuous multiwavelength monitoring over a longer time period is essential for statistical tests of jet emission models.

The presence of jets in NLS1s is surprising, as these sources are typified by comparatively small black hole masses and near-or super-Eddington accretion rates. This challenges the current understanding of the conditions necessary for jet production. Comparing the properties of the jets in NLS1s with those in more familiar jetted systems is thus essential to improve jet production models. We present early results from our campaign to monitor the kinematics and polarization of the parsec-scale jets in a sample of 15 NLS1s through multifrequency observations with the Very Long Baseline Array. These observations are complemented by fast-cadence 15 GHz monitoring with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m telescope and optical spectroscopic monitoring with with the 2 m class telescope at the Guillermo Haro Astrophysics Observatory in Cananea, Mexico.

We suggest that they are transverse Alfven waves propagating on the longitudinal component of a helical magnetic field. The speed of the wave adds relativistically to the speed of the beam, and the apparent speed of the pattern is greater than the beam speed.

These are associated with flat spectrum radio quasars spanning a redshift range z=0.3 to 2.1. X-ray emission is detected from the jet of approximately 60% of the sample objects. We assume minimum energy and apply conditions consistent with the original Felten-Morrison calculations in order to estimate the Lorentz factors and the apparent Doppler factors. This allows estimates of the enthalpy fluxes, which turn out to be comparable to the radiative luminosities.	[Schwartz, D.

This paper outlines our challenges for the last 25 years to design learning systems with fuzzy techniques and their applications to many real world problems. We then focus on the development of human-in-the-loop systems, such as a smart home or an assistive robotic environment, that involve different types of learning strategies. This warrants a full consideration of learning mechanisms in humans that mediate action-selection. We envisage that the principles of fuzzy theory, when combined with what we know about computational learning mechanisms in the human brain, will offer a practical guidance on how we design learning systems to advance user's experience in real-world scenarios.

Therefore, it is desirable to have tools for studying random matrices that are flexible, easy to use, and powerful. Over the last fifteen years, researchers have developed a remarkable family of results, called matrix concentration inequalities, that achieve all of these goals. This monograph offers an invitation to the field of matrix concentration inequalities. It begins with some history of random matrix theory; it describes a flexible model for random matrices that is suitable for many problems; and it discusses the most important matrix concentration results. To demonstrate the value of these techniques, the presentation includes examples drawn from statistics, machine learning, optimization, combinatorics, algorithms, scientific computing, and beyond.

However, a lack of direct comparisons with known biomolecules makes it difficult to substantiate the molecular composition of specific fluorescent components. Here, coincident surface-water measurements of EEMs, dissolved lignin, and total dissolved amino acids (TDAA) acquired in the northern Gulf of Mexico were used to investigate the relationships between specific fluorescent components and DOM biomolecules. Two terrestrial humic-like components identified by EEM-PARAFAC using samples obtained from river to offshore waters were strongly linearly correlated with dissolved lignin concentrations. In addition, changes in terrestrial humic-like abundance were correlated with those in lignin phenol composition, suggesting such components are largely derived from lignin and its alteration products. By applying EEM-PARAFAC to offshore samples, two protein-like components were obtained. The tryptophan-like component was strongly correlated with TDAA concentrations, corroborating the suggested protein/peptide origin of this component. The ratios of tryptophan-like component to tyrosine-like component or dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were also correlated with DOC-normalized yields of TDAA, suggesting these proxies are useful indicators of the bioavailability of DOM in marine waters of the studied ecosystem.

J	Dougherty, SL; Clayton, RW				Dougherty, Sara L.; Clayton, Robert W.			Seismic structure in southern Peru: evidence for a smooth contortion between flat and normal subduction of the Nazca Plate	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Seismicity and tectonics; Body waves; Computational seismology; Subduction zone processes	MANTLE FLOW; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; THERMAL STRUCTURE; SEAMOUNT CHAIN; AMBIENT NOISE; BENEATH PERU; BENIOFF ZONE; SLAB; RIDGE; GEOMETRY	Rapid changes in slab geometry are typically associated with fragmentation of the subducted plate; however, continuous curvature of the slab is also possible. The transition from flat to normal subduction in southern Peru is one such geometrical change. The morphology of the subducted Nazca Plate along this transition is explored using intraslab earthquakes recorded by temporary regional seismic arrays. Observations of a gradual increase in slab dip coupled with a lack of any gaps or vertical offsets in the intraslab seismicity suggest warping of the slab. Concentrations of focal mechanisms at orientations which are indicative of slab bending are also observed along the change in slab geometry. The presence of a thin ultra-slow velocity layer (USL) atop the horizontal Nazca slab is identified and located. The lateral extent of this USL is coincident with the margin of the projected linear continuation of the subducting Nazca Ridge, implying a causal relationship wherein increased hydration of the ridge results in the formation of the USL downdip. Waveform modelling of the 2-D structure in southern Peru using a finite-difference algorithm provides constraints on the velocity and geometry of the slab's seismic structure and confirms the absence of any tears in the slab. The seismicity and structural evidence suggests smooth contortion of the Nazca Plate along the transition from flat to normal subduction. The slab is estimated to have experienced 10 per cent strain in the along-strike direction across this transition.

A new sub-grid surface mass balance and flux model for continental-scale ice sheet modelling: testing and last glacial cycle	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							CLIMATE; PARAMETERIZATION; TEMPERATURE; TOPOGRAPHY; HISTORY; IMPACT; SCHEME	To investigate ice sheet evolution over the timescale of a glacial cycle, 3-D ice sheet models (ISMs) are typically run at "coarse" grid resolutions (10-50 km) that do not resolve individual mountains. This will introduce to-date unquantified errors in sub-grid (SG) transport, accumulation and ablation for regions of rough topography. In the past, synthetic hypsometric curves, a statistical summary of the topography, have been used in ISMs to describe the variability of these processes. However, there has yet to be detailed uncertainty analysis of this approach. We develop a new flow line SG model for embedding in coarse resolution models. A 1 km resolution digital elevation model was used to compute the local hypsometric curve for each coarse grid (CG) cell and to determine local parameters to represent the hypsometric bins' slopes and widths. The 1-D mass transport for the SG model is computed with the shallow ice approximation. We test this model against simulations from the 3-D Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) run at 1 km grid resolution. Results show that none of the alternative parameterizations explored were able to adequately capture SG surface mass balance and flux processes. Via glacial cycle ensemble results for North America, we quantify the impact of SG model coupling in an ISM. We show that SG process representation and associated parametric uncertainties, related to the exchange of ice between the SG and CG cells, can have significant (up to 35m eustatic sea level equivalent for the North American ice complex) impact on modelled ice sheet evolution.

Star catalog position and proper motion corrections in asteroid astrometry	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Orbit determination; Astrometry		We provide a scheme to correct asteroid astrometric observations for star catalog systematic errors due to inaccurate star positions and proper motions. As reference we select the most accurate stars in the PPMXL catalog, i.e., those based on 2MASS astrometry. We compute position and proper motion corrections for 19 of the most used star catalogs. The use of these corrections provides better ephemeris predictions and improves the error statistics of astrometric observations, e.g., by removing most of the regional systematic errors previously seen in Pan-STARRS PS1 asteroid astrometry. The correction table is publicly available at ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pubissdidebiasidebias_2014.tgz and can be freely used in orbit determination algorithms to obtain more reliable asteroid trajectories.

It is essential for our understanding of the planet's geologic and climate history therefore to place these landforms within the global chronostratigraphic context. Here, we analyze both the statistical variability in the cratering pattern as well as the influence of small crater resurfacing on crater counting small landforms. We identified and counted craters (diameter (D) > 200 m) on four type terrains using Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) Context Camera (CTX) imagery that span the Noachian, Hesperian, and Amazonian epochs. The counts from each location include a region covering 10,000 km(2), ten 1000 km(2) subsets of that larger area, and approximately one hundred 100 km(2) samples. The data demonstrate significant variation in the crater size frequency and derived model ages across a single terrain type for the 100 km(2) samples. The crater size frequency at this area scale varies across a single, uniform geologic unit by up to a factor of 2-3 on the four different terrains. At 1000 km(2), the local pattern variations that are relevant at the 100 km(2) scale become less important and the age variations are tighter. In all four terrain cases, the 10,000 km(2) and 1000 km(2) samples capture distinct crater populations (km-sized craters) that formed before and after resurfacing event(s). However, due to the relatively high mean distance between km-sized craters, the 100 km(2) size area samples more commonly than not exclude a statistically significant sample at the kilometer size range, masking important information about the pre-resurfacing history of the terrain. We therefore suggest that due to the effect of pattern variability in cratering over 100 km(2) and the susceptibility of smaller craters to resurfacing, crater counts derived from small area samples are suspect to major uncertainties.

We prove that a global optimum of OPF can be obtained by solving a second-order cone program, under a mild condition after shrinking the OPF feasible set slightly, for radial power networks.

Development and Initial Testing of a Magnetically Shielded Miniature Hall Thruster	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd International Electric Propulsion Conference (IEPC 2013)	OCT 06-10, 2013	George Washington Univ, Washington, DC		George Washington Univ	Hall effect devices; magnetic fields		The scaling of magnetically shielded Hall thrusters to low power is investigated through the development and fabrication of a 4-cm Hall thruster. During initial testing, the magnetically shielded miniature Hall thruster was operated at 275 V discharge voltage and 325-W discharge power. Inspection of the channel walls after testing suggests that the outer discharge channel wall was successfully shielded from high-energy ion erosion while the inner channel wall showed evidence of weaker shielding, likely due to magnetic circuit saturation. Scanning planar probe measurements taken at two locations downstream of the thruster face provided ion current density profiles. The ion current calculated by integrating these data was 1.04 A with a plume divergence half-angle of 30 degrees. Swept retarding potential analyzer measurements taken 80-cm axially downstream of the thruster measured the most probable ion voltage to be 252 V. The total thruster efficiency was calculated from probe measurements to be 43% (anode efficiency of 59%) corresponding to a thrust of 19 mN at a specific impulse of 1870 s. Discharge channel erosion rates were found to be approximately three orders of magnitude less than unshielded Hall thrusters, suggesting the potential for a significant increase in operational life.

Conducting Wall Hall Thrusters	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	33rd International Electric Propulsion Conference (IEPC 2013)	OCT 06-10, 2013	George Washington Univ, Washington, DC		George Washington Univ	Hall effect devices; plasma propulsion	SECONDARY-ELECTRON EMISSION; STATIONARY PLASMA THRUSTERS; SEGMENTED-ELECTRODE; LIFE	A unique configuration of the magnetic field and channel geometry near the wall of Hall thrusters, called magnetic shielding, has recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce the erosion of the boron nitride (BN) walls and extend the life of Hall thrusters by orders of magnitude. The ability of magnetic shielding to minimize interactions between the plasma and the discharge chamber walls in regions where erosion typically occurs has for the first time enabled the replacement of insulating walls with conducting materials without loss in Hall thruster performance. It is important to note that this is not a thruster with anode layer (TAL) where the walls are at or near cathode potential, but is a Hall thruster configuration where the walls are near the anode potential. The BN rings in the 6-kW H6 Hall thruster were replaced with graphite that self-biased to near the anode potential during operation. The thruster efficiency remained over 60% (within 2% of the baseline BN configuration) with a small decrease in thrust and increase in Isp typical of magnetically shielded Hall thrusters. The graphite wall temperatures decreased significantly compared with both shielded and unshielded BN configurations, leading to the potential for higher power operation. Eliminating ceramic walls makes it simpler and less expensive to fabricate a thruster to survive launch loads, and the graphite discharge chamber radiates more efficiently, which increases the power capability of the thruster compared with conventional Hall thruster designs.

In a barrier infrared detector the unipolar barrier should block only the majority carriers while allowing the un-impeded flow of the minority carriers. Under the right conditions, unipolar barrier doping can reduce generation-recombination dark current without affecting minority carrier extraction. In an nBn structure, ideally with an electron unipolar barrier, improper barrier doping or barrier-absorber valence band offset could also block minority carriers and result in higher turn-on bias. We also examined the temperature-dependent turn-on bias in an n(+)Bn device and showed that observed behavior may be attributed to contact doping. Hole mobility in n-doped type-II superlattice (T2SL) is believed to be very low because of the extremely large effective mass along the growth direction. In practice MWIR and LWIR barrier infrared detectors with n-type T2SL absorbers have demonstrated good optical response. A closer inspection of the T2SL band structure offers a possible explanation as to why the hole mobility may not be as poor as suggested by the simple effective mass picture.

ANDERSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers		English	Article; Book Chapter							LOW-VELOCITY ZONE; TRANSITION-ZONE; PACIFIC-OCEAN; ORIGIN; PHASE; LITHOSPHERE; TEMPERATURE; ATTENUATION; TOMOGRAPHY; CONVECTION	It is widely assumed that the boundary layer above the core is the source of intraplate volcanoes such as Hawaii, Samoa, and Yellowstone, and that the sub-plate boundary layer at the top of the mantle is thin and entirely subsolidus. In fact, this upper layer is thicker and has higher expansivity, buoyancy, and insulating power than the lower one, and may have higher potential temperatures. The observed seismic structure of the low-velocity zone (LVZ) including attenuation, anisotropy, sharp boundaries, and a reduction of both compressional and shear moduli can be taken as strong evidence for the ubiquitous presence of melt in the upper mantle. If the LVZ contains as little as 1%-2% melt, then it is the most plausible and accessible source for midplate magmas; deeply rooted active upwellings are unnecessary. The upper boundary layer is also the most plausible source of ancient isotopic signatures of these magmas and their inclusions.

ANDERSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers		English	Article; Book Chapter							TRAVEL-TIMES; LATERAL HETEROGENEITY; SURFACE-WAVE; ATTENUATION; BENEATH; TOMOGRAPHY; MODEL	Near-vertical multiple ScS (S waves reflected at the core-mantle boundary) phases are among the cleanest seismic phases traveling over several thousand kilometers in the Earth's mantle and are useful for constraining the average attenuation and shear wave speed in the whole mantle. However, the available multiple ScS pairs are limited. We took advantage of the recent dramatic increase in the number of global broadband stations and made a thorough computer-assisted search for high-quality data of multiple ScS pairs. We could find 220 station-event pairs which provided us with robust local estimates of average Q (quality factor) and two-way shear wave travel times. With the assumption that geometric focusing caused by lateral velocity heterogeneity does not seriously affect the amplitude measurements, the Q values exhibit strong short-range lateral variations, with very high and very low Q regions adjacent to each other. The mantle beneath seismic station KIP (Hawaii) has normal Q and shear wave speed, which supports the result of earlier studies. The mantle beneath station AFI (Samoa Islands) has a very high Q, possibly larger than 1400, and the slowest shear wave speed. The stations on the upper plate of the Tonga and Japan subduction zones yield average to low Q values. In contrast, the stations on the trenchward side of the upper plate of some subduction zones, e.g., station LVC (Chile) and station PET (Kamchatka, Russia), indicate high Q values, larger than 1000. We found no obvious correlation between Q and shear wave speed, which suggests that different factors like temperature, composition, anisotropy, etc., are controlling these properties in the mantle of different tectonic environments.

The evidence for this consists of the observed dependency in many contexts (reviewed briefly here) of seismic velocity upon angle of propagation and upon angle of S-wave polarization. Despite this well-established understanding, many current investigations continue to employ less realistic isotropic assumptions. One result is the appearance of artifacts which can be interpreted in terms of details of Earth structure rather than of the restrictive assumptions in the analysis. The reason for this neglect of anisotropy is presumably the greater algebraic complexity and the larger number of free parameters of anisotropic seismics. However, the seismic anisotropy in the Earth is usually weak, and the equations for weak anisotropy are only marginally more complex than for isotropy. Further, the additional parameters are commonly required to describe the data. Moreover, the parameters of weak anisotropy defined below (combinations of the anisotropic elastic moduli) are less subject to compounding of uncertainty and to spatial resolution issues than are the individual anisotropic moduli themselves. Hence inversions should seek to fit data with these parameters, rather than with those individual moduli. We briefly review the theory for weak anisotropy and present new equations for the weakly anisotropic velocities of surface waves. The analysis offers new insights on some well-known results found by previous investigations, for example the "Rayleigh wave-Love wave inconsistency", including the facts that Raleigh wave velocities depend not only on the horizontal SV velocity but also on the anisotropy, and Love wave velocities depend not only on the horizontal SH velocity but also on the anisotropy.

ANDERSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers		English	Article; Book Chapter							LITHOSPHERIC PLATES; EXCESS TEMPERATURE; WESTWARD DRIFT; SHEAR-VELOCITY; MODEL; MELT; VOLCANISM; HOTSPOTS; PACIFIC; ORIGIN	The role of decoupling in the low-velocity zone is crucial for understanding plate tectonics and mantle convection. Mantle convection models fail to integrate plate kinematics and thermodynamics of the mantle. In a first gross estimate, we computed at >300 km(3)/yr the volume of the plates lost along subduction zones. Mass balance predicts that slabs are compensated by broad passive upwellings beneath oceans and continents, passively emerging at oceanic ridges and backarc basins. These may correspond to the broad low-wavespeed regions found in the upper mantle by tomography. However, west-directed slabs enter the mantle more than three times faster (similar to 232 km(3)/yr) than in the opposite east- or northeast-directed subduction zones (similar to 74 km(3)/yr). This difference is consistent with the westward drift of the outer shell relative to the underlying mantle, which accounts for the steep dip of west-directed slabs, the asymmetry between flanks of oceanic ridges, and the directions of ridge migration. The larger recycling volumes along west-directed subduction zones imply asymmetric cooling of the underlying mantle and that there is an "easterly" directed component of the upwelling replacement mantle. In this model, mantle convection is tuned by polarized decoupling of the advecting and shearing upper boundary layer. Return mantle flow can result from passive volume balance rather than only by thermal buoyancy-driven upwelling.

In the framework of rigid tectonic plates, we make use of recent tomographic models of azimuthal anisotropy to derive the best rotation pole of the Pacific plate in the uppermost 200 km of the mantle. It is found to be in good agreement with current plate motion (NUVEL1, HS3, and NNR). However, when dividing the Pacific plate into two subplates separated by what we refer to as the megagash, an east-west low-velocity and low-anisotropy band extending across the Pacific plate from Samoa-Tonga to the Easter-Juan Fernandez Islands, the rotation pole of northern Pacific is still in agreement with current plate motion but not the rotation pole of the southern part of the Pacific, far away from the "classical" rotation pole of the Pacific plate. This result suggests a differential motion between the North and South Pacific and an ongoing reorganization of plates in the Pacific Ocean. The megagash might be a future plate boundary between the North and South Pacific plates, associated with the intense volcanism along this band.

The Yellowstone "hot spot" track results from migrating basin-range extension	INTERDISCIPLINARY EARTH: A VOLUME IN HONOR OF DON L.

There are many geological mismatches with the basic plume model as well as logical flaws, such as citing data postulated to require a deep-mantle origin in support of an "upper-mantle plume" model. USArray has recently yielded abundant new seismological results, but despite this, seismic analyses have still not resolved the disparity of opinion. This suggests that seismology may be unable to resolve the plume question for Yellowstone, and perhaps elsewhere. USArray data have inspired many new models that relate western U.S. volcanism to shallow mantle convection associated with subduction zone processes. Many of these models assume that the principal requirement for surface volcanism is melt in the mantle and that the lithosphere is essentially passive. In this paper we propose a pure plate model in which melt is commonplace in the mantle, and its inherent buoyancy is not what causes surface eruptions. Instead, it is extension of the lithosphere that permits melt to escape to the surface and eruptions to occur-the mere presence of underlying melt is not a sufficient condition. The time-progressive chain of rhyolitic calderas in the eastern Snake River Plain-Yellowstone zone that has formed since basin-range extension began at ca. 17 Ma results from laterally migrating lithospheric extension and thinning that has permitted basaltic magma to rise from the upper mantle and melt the lower crust. We propose that this migration formed part of the systematic eastward migration of the axis of most intense basin-range extension. The bimodal rhyolite-basalt volcanism followed migration of the locus of most rapid extension, not vice versa. This model does not depend on seismology to test it but instead on surface geological observations.

The mantle isotopic printer: Basic mantle plume geochemistry for seismologists and geodynamicists	INTERDISCIPLINARY EARTH: A VOLUME IN HONOR OF DON L. ANDERSON	Geological Society of America Special Papers		English	Article; Book Chapter							LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCES; HIGH HE-3/HE-4 RATIOS; OCEANIC-CRUST; ISLAND BASALTS; NOBLE-GASES; LITHOSPHERIC MANTLE; CONVECTION PLUMES; PICRITIC BASALTS; NIKITIN RISE; EVOLUTION	High-temperature geochemistry combined with igneous petrology is an essential tool to infer the conditions of magma generation and evolution in the Earth's interior. During the past thirty years, a large number of geochemical models of the Earth, essentially inferred from the isotopic composition of basaltic rocks, have been proposed. These geochemical models have paid little attention to basic physics concepts, broadband seismology, or geological evidence, with the effect of producing results that are constrained more by assumptions than by data or first principles. This may not be evident to seismologists and geodynamicists. A common view in igneous petrology, seismology, and mantle modeling is that isotope geochemistry (e.g., the Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, U-Th-He, Re-Os, Lu-Hf, and other less commonly used systems) has the power to identify physical regions in the mantle, their depths, their rheological behavior, and the thermal conditions of magma generation. We demonstrate the fallacy of this approach and the model-dependent conclusions that emerge from unconstrained or poorly constrained geochemical models that do not consider physics, seismology (other than teleseismic travel-time tomography and particularly compelling colored mantle cross sections), and geology. Our view may be compared with computer printers. These can reproduce the entire range of colors using a limited number of basic colors (black, magenta, yellow, and cyan). Similarly, the isotopic composition of oceanic basalts and nearly all their primitive continental counterparts can be expressed in terms of a few mantle end members. The four most important (actually "most extreme", because some are extraordinarily rare) mantle end members identified by isotope geochemists are DMM or DUM (depleted MORB [mid-ocean-ridge basalt] mantle or depleted upper mantle), HIMU (high mu, where mu = mu = U-238/Pb-204), EMI, and EMII (enriched mantle type I and type II). Other mantle end members, or components, have been proposed in the geochemical literature (e.g., PHeM, FOZO, LVC, PreMa, EMIII, CMR, LOMU, and C), but these can be considered to be less extreme components or mixtures in the geochemical mantle zoo. Assuming the existence of these extreme "colors" in the mantle isotopic printer, the only matter for debate is their location in the Earth's interior. At least three of them need long-term insulation from convection-driven homogenization or mixing processes. In other words, where these extreme isotopic end members are located needs to be defined. In our view, no geochemical, geological, geophysical, or physical arguments require the derivation of any magma from deep mantle sources. Arguments to the contrary are assumption based. The HIMU, EMI, and EMII end members can be entirely located in the shallow non-convecting volume of the mantle, while the fourth, which is by far the more abundant volumetrically (DMM or DUM), can reside in the transition zone. This view is inverted compared with current canonical geochemical views of the Earth's mantle, where the shallowest portions are assumed to be DMM like (ambient mantle) and the EMI-EMII-HIMU end members are assumed to be isolated, located in the deep mantle, and associated with thermal anomalies. We argue that the ancient, depleted signatures of DMM imply long-term isolation from recycling and crustal contamination while the enriched components are not free of contamination by shallow materials and can therefore be shallow.

HIERARCHICAL SPARSE BAYESIAN LEARNING FOR STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING WITH INCOMPLETE MODAL DATA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION			English	Article						dynamical system; inverse problem; hierarchical sparse Bayesian learning; damage detection; structural health monitoring; Bayesian Ockham razor; IASC-ASCE simulated Benchmark problem	PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; IDENTIFICATION; MODELS	For civil structures, structural damage due to severe loading events such as earthquakes, or due to long-term environmental degradation, usually occurs in localized areas of a structure. A new sparse Bayesian probabilistic framework for computing the probability of localized stiffness reductions induced by damage is presented that uses noisy incomplete modal data from before and after possible damage. This new approach employs system modal parameters of the structure as extra variables for Bayesian model updating with incomplete modal data. A specific hierarchical Bayesian model is constructed that promotes spatial sparseness in the inferred stiffness reductions in a way that is consistent with the Bayesian Ockham razor. To obtain the most plausible model of sparse stiffness reductions together with its uncertainty within a specified class of models, the method employs an optimization scheme that iterates among all uncertain parameters, including the hierarchical hyper-parameters. The approach has four important benefits: (1) it infers spatially sparse stiffness changes based on the identified modal parameters; (2) the uncertainty in the inferred stiffness reductions is quantified; (3) no matching of model and experimental modes is needed, and (4) solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem of a structural model is not required. The proposed method is applied to two previously studied examples using simulated data: a ten-story shear-building and the three-dimensional braced-frame model from the Phase II Simulated Benchmark problem sponsored by the IASC-ASCE Task Group on Structural Health Monitoring. The results show that the occurrence of false-positive and false-negative damage detection is clearly reduced in the presence of modeling error (differences between the real structural behavior and the model of it). Furthermore, the identified most probable stiffness loss ratios are close to their actual values.

An Assessment of SAPHIR Calibration Using Quality Tropical Soundings	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION DRY BIAS; HUMIDITY DATA; AMSU-A; MICROWAVE; WATER; LAND; TEMPERATURE; GHZ; EMISSIVITIES; RADIANCES	The Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d'Humidite Intertropicale par Radiometrie (SAPHIR) instrument on board the Megha-Tropiques (MT) platform is a cross-track, multichannel microwave humidity sounder with six channels near the 183.31-GHz water vapor absorption line, a maximum scan angle of 42.96 degrees (resulting in a maximum incidence angle of 50.7 degrees), a 1700-km-wide swath, and a footprint resolution of 10 km at nadir. SAPHIR L1A2 brightness temperature (BT) observations have been compared to BTs simulated by the radiative transfer model (RTM) Radiative Transfer for the Television and Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (RTTOV-10), using in situ measurements from radiosondes as input. Selected radiosonde humidity observations from the Cooperative Indian Ocean Experiment on Intraseasonal Variability in the Year (CINDY)-Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) campaign (September 2011-March 2012) were spatiotemporally collocated with MT overpasses. Although several sonde systems were used during the campaign, all of the sites selected for this study used the VaisalaRS92-SGPDsystem and were chosen in order to avoid discrepancies in data quality and biases. To interpret the results of the comparison between the sensor data and the RTM simulations, uncertainties associated with the data processing must be propagated throughout the evaluation. The magnitude of the bias was found to be dependent on the observing channel, increasing from 0.18 K for the 183.31 +/- 0.2-GHz channel to 2.3K for the 183.31 +/- 11-GHz channel. Uncertainties and errors that could impact the BT biases were investigated. These can be linked to the RTM input and design, the radiosonde observations, the chosen methodology of comparison, and the SAPHIR instrument itself.

In bacteria, these channels are believed to protect against an osmotic shock. The physiological function of these channels has been characterized primarily by a standardized assay, where aliquots of batch-cultured cells are rapidly pipetted into a hypotonic medium. Under this method, it has been inferred many types of MS channels (MscS homologs in Escherichia coli) demonstrate limited effectiveness against shock, typically rescuing less than 10% of the cells when expressed at native levels. We introduce a single-cell-based assay which allows us to control how fast the osmolarity changes, over time scales ranging from a fraction of a second to several minutes. We find that the protection provided by MS channels depends strongly on the rate of osmotic change, revealing that, under a slow enough osmotic drop, MscS homologs can lead to survival rates comparable to those found in wild-type strains. Further, after the osmotic downshift, we observe multiple death phenotypes, which are inconsistent with the prevailing paradigm of how cells lyse. Both of these findings require a reevaluation of our basic understanding of the physiology of MS channels.

In the proposed method, the Brinkman penalization is applied iteratively only in the neighborhood of the body. This allows for using significantly larger time steps, than what is customary in the Brinkman penalization, thus reducing its computational cost while maintaining the capability of the method to handle complex geometries. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by considering challenging benchmark problems such as flow past an impulsively started cylinder and normal to an impulsively started and accelerated flat plate. We find that the present method enhances significantly the accuracy of the Brinkman penalization technique for the simulations of highly unsteady flows past complex geometries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Although small improvements in the CMB constraints are expected, the next frontier of precision will come from future large-scale surveys of the galaxy distribution. The advantage of such surveys is that they can measure many more modes than the CMB - in particular, forthcoming radio surveys with the Square Kilometre Array will cover huge volumes. Radio continuum surveys deliver the largest volumes, but with the disadvantage of no redshift information. In order to mitigate this, we use two additional observables. First, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe - effect the cross-correlation of the radio number counts with the CMB temperature anisotropies - helps to reduce systematics on the large scales that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity. Second, optical data allows for cross-identification in order to gain some redshift information. We show that, while the single redshift bin case can provide a sigma(f(NL)) similar to 20, and is therefore not competitive with current and future constraints on non-Gaussianity, a tomographic analysis could improve the constraints by an order of magnitude, even with only two redshift bins. A huge improvement is provided by the addition of high-redshift sources, so having cross-ID for high-z galaxies and an even higher-z radio tail is key to enabling very precise measurements of f(NL). We use Fisher matrix forecasts to predict the constraining power in the case of no redshift information and the case where cross-ID allows a tomographic analysis, and we show that the constraints do not improve much with 3 or more bins. Our results show that SKA continuum surveys could provide constraints competitive with CMB and forthcoming optical surveys, potentially allowing a measurement of sigma(fNL) similar to 1 to be made. Moreover, these measurements would act as a useful check of results obtained with other probes at other redshift ranges with other methods.

Ice discharge uncertainties in Northeast Greenland from boundary conditions and climate forcing of an ice flow model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						uncertainty; ice stream; ice flow; mass flux; ice discharge	MASS-LOSS; HEAT-FLUX; SHEET; ACCELERATION; RETENTION; INTERIOR; RUNOFF; MELT	In order to understand ice sheet response to climate change, it is critical to examine errors associated with ice flow model boundary conditions and forcing. It is also important to understand how these errors propagate through numerical ice sheet models and contribute to uncertainty in model output. Using established uncertainty quantification methods within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), we investigate the sensitivity of ice flow within the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) to key fields, including ice viscosity and basal drag, and compare them with model sensitivity to climate forcing. In addition, we examine how errors in model input manifest as mass flux uncertainties during a forward simulation of the NEGIS from 1989 to 2010. Overall, we find that mass flux is most uncertain in the main outlets, Nioghalvfjerdsbrae and Zachariae IsstrOm, and that mass flux is most sensitive to basal drag, though errors associated with basal drag are poorly constrained and difficult to quantify. Given our knowledge of errors associated with the thermal properties of ice, we estimate that in the ablation area, the effects of cryohydrologic warming contribute over 4 times more mass flux uncertainty that do errors in geothermal heat flux. We find that NEGIS total ice discharge is associated with a 0.7 Gt/yr (2.6%) uncertainty due to errors in geothermal heat flux and a 3.3 Gt/yr (11.6%) uncertainty due to the added effects of cryohydrologic warming. In comparison, errors in surface mass balance contribute 4.5 Gt/yr to NEGIS total discharge uncertainty.

Space geodesy constrains ice age terminal deglaciation: The global ICE-6G_C (VM5a) model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH			English	Article						glacial isostasy; space geodesy; mantle dynamics	GLACIAL-ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; RELATIVE SEA-LEVEL; BASE-LINE INTERFEROMETRY; DEEP MANTLE VISCOSITY; ANTARCTIC PENINSULA; MAPPING FUNCTIONS; REEF TRACTS; VM2 MODEL; GPS DATA; CLIMATE	A new model of the last deglaciation event of the Late Quaternary ice age is here described and denoted as ICE-6G_C (VM5a). It differs from previously published models in this sequence in that it has been explicitly refined by applying all of the available Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of vertical motion of the crust that may be brought to bear to constrain the thickness of local ice cover as well as the timing of its removal. Additional space geodetic constraints have also been applied to specify the reference frame within which the GPS data are described. The focus of the paper is upon the three main regions of Last Glacial Maximum ice cover, namely, North America, Northwestern Europe/Eurasia, and Antarctica, although Greenland and the British Isles will also be included, if peripherally, in the discussion. In each of the three major regions, the model predictions of the time rate of change of the gravitational field are also compared to that being measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites as an independent means of verifying the improvement of the model achieved by applying the GPS constraints. Several aspects of the global characteristics of this new model are also discussed, including the nature of relative sea level history predictions at far-field locations, in particular the Caribbean island of Barbados, from which especially high-quality records of postglacial sea level change are available but which records were not employed in the development of the model. Although ICE-6G_C (VM5a) is a significant improvement insofar as the most recently available GPS observations are concerned, comparison of model predictions with such far-field relative sea level histories enables us to identify a series of additional improvements that should follow from a further stage of model iteration.

Marine ice-sheet profiles and stability under Coulomb basal conditions	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctic glaciology; glacial rheology; glacier mechanics; glacier modelling; ice-sheet modelling	WEST ANTARCTICA; STREAM-B; TILL DEFORMATION; PINE ISLAND; COLLAPSE; RETREAT; FLOW; MECHANICS; SEDIMENT; DYNAMICS	The behavior of marine-terminating ice sheets, such as the West Antarctic ice sheet, is of interest due to the possibility of rapid grounding-line retreat and consequent catastrophic loss of ice. Critical to modeling this behavior is a choice of basal rheology, where the most popular approach is to relate the ice-sheet velocity to a power-law function of basal stress. Recent experiments, however, suggest that near-grounding line tills exhibit Coulomb friction behavior. Here we address how Coulomb conditions modify ice-sheet profiles and stability criteria. The basal rheology necessarily transitions to Coulomb friction near the grounding line, due to low effective stresses, leading to changes in ice-sheet properties within a narrow boundary layer. Ice-sheet profiles 'taper off' towards a flatter upper surface, compared with the power-law case, and basal stresses vanish at the grounding line, consistent with observations. In the Coulomb case, the grounding-line ice flux also depends more strongly on flotation ice thickness, which implies that ice sheets are more sensitive to climate perturbations. Furthermore, with Coulomb friction, the ice sheet grounds stably in shallower water than with a power-law rheology. This implies that smaller perturbations are required to push the grounding line into regions of negative bed slope, where it would become unstable. These results have important implications for ice-sheet stability in a warming climate.

Hilmar			An improved model for tidally modulated grounding-line migration	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						Antarctic glaciology; glacier mechanics; glacier modelling; ice/ocean interactions	ICE STREAM; WEST ANTARCTICA; PINE ISLAND; DYNAMICS; THWAITES; GLACIERS; RETREAT; SURFACE; FLEXURE; SHELF	Understanding grounding-line dynamics is necessary for predictions of long-term ice-sheet stability. However, despite growing observations of the tidal influence on grounding-line migration, this short-timescale migration is poorly understood, with most modeling attempts assuming beam theory to calculate displacements. Here we present an improved model of tidal grounding-line migration that treats migration as an elastic fracture problem, forced by the additional ocean water pressure from the tide. This new model predicts that the grounding line cannot be assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and, furthermore, that migration is inherently asymmetric and nonlinear, with migration distances that are not proportional to the tidal load. Specifically, for constant surface slope, the grounding line migrates upstream approximately ten times further as the tide rises from mean sea level to high tide than it migrates downstream as the tide falls from mean sea level to low tide, and migration distances are substantially larger than simple flotation arguments suggest. Numerical tests also show that the dependence of migration distance on elastic moduli and ice-sheet thickness are inconsistent with predictions of beam theory for a range of realistic values. Finally, applying the new model to observations in Antarctica results in new estimates of bed slopes, though these estimates remain uncertain due to imperfect knowledge of the relevant rheological parameters.

J	Kwok, R; Haas, C				Kwok, R.; Haas, C.			Effects of radar side-lobes on snow depth retrievals from Operation IceBridge	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article						remote sensing; sea ice; snow; snow/ice surface processes	ARCTIC SEA-ICE; THICKNESS	Arctic snow depth data products from four years (2009-12) of Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) surveys are examined. In our analysis, we found spurious spikes in the snow depth distributions of both the multi-year and seasonal ice covers. These spikes are artifacts that stem from the incorrect identification of side lobes and main lobes of the impulse response of the snow radar as returns from the air-snow interface. The current OIB snow depth retrieval algorithm does not explicitly account for the presence of these side lobes and main lobes. As a result, overall accuracy of snow depth returns and related statistics is negatively affected. Although the range locations of these side lobes are predictable for each radar installation, they vary with individual airborne campaigns. Comparisons with limited in situ snow surveys show significant differences of >20 cm between OIB and in situ snow surveys. These artifacts affect OIB ice thickness estimates because they rely on estimates of sea-ice freeboard, which are calculated as the differences between coincident snow freeboard from lidar elevations and the retrieved snow depth estimates discussed here. Since these products are widely distributed to the scientific community, our results suggest that earlier geophysical studies based on these products may need to be re-examined.

The SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification does not directly provide a mechanism for defining hierarchical models, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package for SBML Level 3 adds the necessary features to SBML to support hierarchical modeling. The package enables a modeler to include submodels within an enclosing SBML model, delete unneeded or redundant elements of that submodel, replace elements of that submodel with element of the containing model, and replace elements of the containing model with elements of the submodel. In addition, the package defines an optional "port" construct, allowing a model to be defined with suggested interfaces between hierarchical components; modelers can chose to use these interfaces, but they are not required to do so and can still interact directly with model elements if they so chose. Finally, the SBML Hierarchical Model Composition package is defined in such a way that a hierarchical model can be "flattened" to an equivalent, non-hierarchical version that uses only plain SBML constructs, thus enabling software tools that do not yet support hierarchy to nevertheless work with SBML hierarchical models.

We report Density Functional Theory (DFT) molecular dynamics simulations (DFT-MD) on DTTO crystal for the two most stable monomers. We predict that the most stable isomer (c1) has a density of rho = 1.96 g cm(-3) with an estimated detonation velocity (D-v) of 9.70 km s(-1) and a detonation pressure (D-p) of 43.0 GPa, making it comparable to RDX (rho = 1.82 g cm(-3), D-v = 8.75 km s(-1), D-p = 35.0 GPa), HMX (rho = 1.91 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.10 km s(-1), D-p = 39.3 GPa) and CL-20 (rho = 2.04 g cm(-3), D-v = 9.38 km s(-1), D-p = 44.1 GPa). The DFT-MD studies find that the initial reaction at lower pressure is unimolecular decomposition to form two N2O molecules (barrier 45.9 kcal mol(-1)), while at higher pressure it is intermolecular oxygen-transfer with a barrier of 40.1 kcal mol(-1). For the c2 isomer (less stable by 1.2 kcal mol(-1)) the initial reaction involves two DTTO molecules reacting to form a dimer which then releases N-2 as a direct product (barrier 48.1 kcal mol(-1)), a unique initial reaction among EMs. These results suggest that DTTO may have a higher thermal stability (barrier >7.0 kcal mol(-1) higher) than RDX, HMX, and CL-20.

We compared the thermal decomposition of the TNT/CL-20 cocrystal with that of pure crystals of TNT and CL-20 and with a simple physical mixture of TNT and CL-20. We find that cocrystal has a lower decomposition rate than CL-20 but higher than TNT, which is consistent with experimental observation. We find that the formation of carbon clusters arising from TNT, a carbon-rich molecule, plays an important role in the thermal decomposition process, explaining the decrease in sensitivity for the cocrystal. At low temperature and in the early stage of chemical reactions under high temperature, the cocrystal releases energy more slowly than the simple mixture of CL-20-TNT. These results confirm the expectation that co-crystallization is an effective way to decrease the sensitivity for energetic materials while retaining high performance.

Jeffrey			Enhanced thermoelectric properties of Sr5In2Sb6 via Zn-doping	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							POWER; SUBSTITUTION; COMPOUND	Zintl phases exhibit inherently low thermal conductivity and adjustable electronic properties, which are integral to designing high-efficiency thermoelectric materials. Inspired by the promising thermoelectric figure of merit of optimized A(5)M(2)Sb(6) Zintl phases (A = Ca or Sr, M = Al, Ga, In), Zn-doped Sr5In2-xZnxSb6 (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1) compounds were investigated. Optical absorption measurements combined with band structure calculations indicate two distinct energy transitions for Sr5In2Sb6, one direct (E-g similar to 0.3 eV) and the other from a lower valence band manifold to the conduction band edge (E-g similar to 0.55 eV). Sr5In2Sb6 exhibits nondegenerate p-type semiconducting behavior with low carrier concentration (similar to 4 x 10(18) h(+) cm(-3) at 300 K). Charge carrier tuning was achieved by Zn2+ substitution on the In3+ site, increasing carrier concentrations to up to 10(20) h(+) cm(-3). All samples displayed relatively low thermal conductivities (similar to 0.7 W m(-1) K-1 at 700 K). The Zn-doped samples exhibited significantly higher zT values compared to the undoped sample, reaching a value of similar to 0.4 at 750 K for Sr5In1.9Zn0.1Sb6.

Mechanochemical synthesis and high temperature thermoelectric properties of calcium-doped lanthanum telluride La3-xCaxTe4	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article								The thermoelectric properties from 300-1275 K of calcium-doped La3-xTe4 are reported. La3-xTe4 is a high temperature n-type thermoelectric material with a previously reported zT(max) similar to 1.1 at 1273 K and x = 0.23. Computational modeling suggests the La atoms define the density of states of the conduction band for La3-xTe4. Doping with Ca2+ on the La3+ site is explored as a means of modifying the density of states to improve the power factor and to achieve a finer control over the carrier concentration. High purity, oxide-free samples are produced by ball milling of the elements and consolidation by spark plasma sintering. Calcium substitution upon the lanthanum site was confirmed by a combination of Rietveld refinements of powder X-ray diffraction data and wave dispersive spectroscopy. A zT(max) similar to 1.2 is reached at 1273 K for the composition La2.2Ca0.78Te4 and the relative increase compared to La3-xTe4 is attributed to the finer carrier concentration.

Jeffrey			High temperature thermoelectric properties of Zn-doped Eu5In2Sb6	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ZINTL PHASES; POWER-GENERATION; EFFICIENCY; CHEMISTRY; COMPOUND; ELECTRON; BAND	The complex bonding environment of many ternary Zintl phases, which often results in low thermal conductivity, makes them strong contenders as thermoelectric materials. Here, we extend the investigation of A(5)In(2)Sb(6) Zintl compounds with the Ca5Ga2As6 crystal structure to the only known rare-earth analogue: Eu5In2Sb6. Zn-doped samples with compositions of Eu5In2-xZnxSb6 (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) were synthesized via ball milling followed by hot pressing. Eu5In2Sb6 showed significant improvements in air stability relative to its alkaline earth metal analogues. Eu5In2Sb6 exhibits semi-conducting behavior with possible two band behavior suggested by increasing band mass as a function of Zn content, and two distinct transitions observed in optical absorption measurements (at 0.15 and 0.27 eV). The p-type Hall mobility of Eu5In2Sb6 was found to be much larger than that of the alkaline earth containing A(5)In(2)Sb(6) phases (A = Sr, Ca) consistent with the reduced hole effective mass (1.1 me). Zn doping was successful in optimizing the carrier concentration, leading to a zT of up to 0.4 at similar to 660 K, which is comparable to that of Zn-doped Sr5In2Sb6.

Materials with the nominal composition [CoSb2(GeTe)(0.5)](x)(GeTe)(10.5)Sb2Te3 (x = 0-2) contain nano-to microscale precipitates of skutterudite-type phases which are homogeneously distributed. Powder X-ray diffraction reveals that phase transitions of the germanium antimony telluride matrix depend on its GeTe content. These are typical for this class of materials; however, the phase transition temperatures are influenced by heterostructuring in a beneficial way, yielding a larger existence range of the intrinsically nanostructured pseudocubic structure of the matrix. Using microfocused synchrotron radiation in combination with crystallite pre-selection by means of electron microscopy, single crystals of the matrix as well as of the precipitates were examined. They show nano-domain twinning of the telluride matrix and a pronounced structure distortion in the precipitates caused by GeTe substitution. Thermoelectric figures of merit of 1.4 +/- 0.3 at 450 degrees C are observed. In certain temperature ranges, heterostructuring involves an improvement of up to 30% compared to the homogeneous material.

Based on density functional theory calculations, this group of materials is predicted to attain high zT (i.e. similar to 1.8 for p-type trigonal TmAgTe2 at 600 K). Among approximately 500 chemical variants of XYZ(2) explored, many candidates with good stability and favorable electronic band structures (with high band degeneracy leading to high power factor) are presented. Trigonal TmAgTe2 has been synthesized and exhibits an extremely low measured thermal conductivity of 0.2-0.3 W m(-1) K-1 for T > 600 K. The zT value achieved thus far for p-type trigonal TmAgTe2 is approximately 0.35, and is limited by a low hole concentration (similar to 10(17) cm(-3) at room temperature). Defect calculations indicate that Tm-Ag antisite defects are very likely to form and act as hole killers. Further defect engineering to reduce such X-Y antisites is deemed important to optimize the zT value of the p-type TmAgTe2.

Interfacial reactions between PbTe-based thermoelectric materials and Cu and Ag bonding materials	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							LEAD-TELLURIDE; MODULE APPLICATIONS; WASTE HEAT; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; GENERATOR; DEVICES; POWER	The development of reliable bonding materials for PbTe-based thermoelectric modules that can undergo long-term operations at high temperature is carried out. Two cost-effective materials, Cu and Ag, are isothermally hot-pressed to PbTe-based thermoelectric materials at 550 degrees C for 3 h under a pressure of 40 MPa by the rapid hot-pressing method. Scanning electron microscopy, electron probe micro-analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis are employed to identify intermetallic compounds, chemical reactions, and microstructure evolution after the initial assembly and subsequent isothermal aging at 400 degrees C and 550 degrees C. We find that Cu diffuses faster than Ag in PbTe. Neither Cu nor Ag is a good bonding material because they both react vigorously with Pb0.6Sn0.4Te. In order to be able to use Cu electrodes, it would be necessary to insert a diffusion barrier to prevent Cu diffusion into PbTe.	[Li, C. C.; Snyder, G.

We experimentally show that superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors allow QKD over a channel featuring 60dB loss, and QKD with more than 600 bits of secret key per second (not considering finite key effects) over a 16dB loss channel. This corresponds to 300 and 80km of standard telecommunication fiber, respectively. We also demonstrate that the integration of our QKD system into FPGA-based hardware (instead of state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators) does not impact on its performance. Our investigation allows us to acquire an improved understanding of the trade-offs between complexity, cost and system performance, which is required for future customization of MDI-QKD. Given that our system can be operated outside the laboratory over deployed fiber, we conclude that MDI-QKD is a promising approach to information-theoretic secure key distribution.

Micro/nanoscale patterning of small area electrochemical sensor surfaces enhances the sensor performance to overcome the limitations resulting from their small surface area and thus is the key to the successful miniaturization of integrated platforms. We have demonstrated the microfabrication of electrochemical sensors utilizing top-down lithography and etching techniques on silicon and CMOS substrates. This choice of fabrication avoids the need of bottom-up techniques that are not compatible with established methods for fabricating electronics (e.g., CMOS) which form the industrial basis of most integrated microsystems. We present the results of applying microfabricated sensors to various measurement problems, with special attention to their use for continuous DNA and glucose sensing. Our results demonstrate the advantages of using micro- and nanofabrication techniques for the miniaturization and optimization of modern sensing platforms that employ well-established electronic measurement techniques.

The variety of existing ocean reanalyses is exploited in a multi-reanalysis ensemble to improve the ocean state estimation and to gauge uncertainty levels. The ensemble-based analysis of signal-to-noise ratio allows the identification of ocean characteristics for which the estimation is robust (such as tropical mixedlayer-depth, upper ocean heat content), and where large uncertainty exists (deep ocean, Southern Ocean, sea ice thickness, salinity), providing guidance for future enhancement of the observing and data assimilation systems.

Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) Oceanview supports the national research groups providing them with coordination and sharing expertise among the partners. Several systems have been set up and developed pre-operationally, and the majority of these are now fully operational; at the present time, they provide medium-and long-term forecasts of the most relevant ocean physical variables. These systems are based on ocean general circulation models and data-assimilation techniques that are able to correct the model with the information inferred from different types of observations. A few systems also incorporate a biogeochemical component coupled with the physical system, while others are based on coupled ocean-wave-ice-atmosphere models. The products are routinely validated with observations in order to assess their quality. Data and product implementation and organization, as well as service, for users have been well tried and tested, and most of the products are now available to users. The interaction with different users is an important factor in the development process. This paper provides a synthetic overview of the GODAE OceanView prediction systems.

Aluminum Borate Coating on High-Voltage Cathodes for Li-Ion Batteries	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							LI2MNO3-LIMO2 M; HIGH-CAPACITY; ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCE; IRREVERSIBLE CAPACITY; MANGANESE OXIDE; MN; NI; ELECTRODES; MECHANISM; LIBOB	Li-rich layered-layered nickel manganese cobalt oxides (LLNMC) of the type Li2MnO3-LiMO2 (M = Mn, Co, Ni) are promising cathode materials due to their higher specific capacities and discharge voltages compared to state of art materials. However, these materials have yet to exhibit adequate cycle life and power characteristics in practical cells, partly due to the instability of electrolytes at these high voltages. Thin coatings of inorganic materials such as Al2O3, AlPO4, and ALF(3) have been shown to minimize these degradation processes, especially on high voltage cathodes. Here, we report the use of a new aluminum borate-based coating material on the LLNMC cathode at high active mass loadings. AlBO3-coated cathodes demonstrate a sevenfold increase in lifetime compared to uncoated material, as well as higher specific discharge energies vs. analogous AlPO4-coated materials. SEM and TEM confirm the thin coatings of amorphous material. Detailed electrochemical studies including Tafel polarization, PITT, and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) show that the AlBO3 coating improves the kinetics of electron transfer.

A micromechanical damage and fracture model for polymers based on fractional strain-gradient elasticity	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS			English	Article						Polymers; Damage; Failure; Polyurea; Fracture	APPROXIMATION SCHEMES; PRESSURE-SENSITIVITY; 3 DIMENSIONS; CAVITATION; DEFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; GROWTH; CRACK; TWINS; LAW	We formulate a simple one-parameter macroscopic model of distributed damage and fracture of polymers that is amenable to a straightforward and efficient numerical implementation. We show that the macroscopic model can be rigorously derived, in the sense of optimal scaling, from a micromechanical model of chain elasticity and failure regularized by means of fractional strain-gradient elasticity. In particular, we derive optimal scaling laws that supply a link between the single parameter of the macroscopic model, namely, the critical energy-release rate of the material, and micromechanical parameters pertaining to the elasticity and strength of the polymer chains and to the strain-gradient elasticity regularization. We show how the critical energy-release rate of specific materials can be determined from test data. Finally, we demonstrate the scope and fidelity of the model by means of an example of application, namely, Taylor-impact experiments of polyurea 1000 rods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In contrast to conventional sequence prediction problems such as part-of-speech tagging (where output sequences are selected using a relatively small set of discrete labels), our goal is to predict sequences that lie within a high dimensional continuous output space. We present a decision tree framework for learning an accurate non-parametric spatiotemporal sequence predictor. Our approach enjoys several attractive properties, including ease of training, fast performance at test time, and the ability to robustly tolerate corrupted training data using a novel latent variable approach. We evaluate on several datasets, and demonstrate substantial improvements over existing decision tree based sequence learning frameworks such as SEARN and DAgger.

Optofluidic ultrahigh-throughput detection of fluorescent drops	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							IMAGE SENSORS; MICROFLUIDICS; DROPLETS; SINGLE; ARRAY; EMULSIONS; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS; CHIP	This paper describes an optofluidic droplet interrogation device capable of counting fluorescent drops at a throughput of 254000 drops per second. To our knowledge, this rate is the highest interrogation rate published thus far. Our device consists of 16 parallel microfluidic channels bonded directly to a filter-coated two-dimensional Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor array. Fluorescence signals emitted from the drops are collected by the sensor that forms the bottom of the channel. The proximity of the drops to the sensor facilitates efficient collection of fluorescence emission from the drops, and overcomes the trade-off between light collection efficiency and field of view in conventional microscopy. The interrogation rate of our device is currently limited by the acquisition speed of CMOS sensor, and is expected to increase further as high-speed sensors become increasingly available.

Jeffrey; Felser, Claudia			Resolving the true band gap of ZrNiSn half-Heusler thermoelectric materials	MATERIALS HORIZONS			English	Article							N-TYPE; TRANSPORT; TINISN; SUBSTITUTION; STABILITY; FIGURE; MERIT	N-type XNiSn (X = Ti, Zr, Hf) half-Heusler (HH) compounds possess excellent thermoelectric properties, which are believed to be attributed to their relatively high mobility. However, p-type XNiSn HH compounds have poor figures of merit, zT, compared to XCoSb compounds. This can be traced to the suppression of the magnitude of the thermopower at high temperatures. E-g = 2eS(max)T(max) relates the band gap to the thermopower peak. However, from this formula, one would conclude that the band gap of p-type XNiSn solid solutions is only one-third that of n-type XNiSn, which effectively prevents p-type XNiSn HHs from being useful thermoelectric materials. The study of p-type HH Zr1-xScxNiSn solid solutions show that the large mobility difference between electrons and holes in XNiSn results in a significant correction to the Goldsmid-Sharp formula. This finding explains the difference in the thermopower band gap between n-type and p-type HH. The high electron-to-hole weighted mobility ratio leads to an effective suppression of the bipolar effect in the thermoelectric transport properties which is essential for high zT values in n-type XNiSn (X = Ti, Zr, Hf) HH compounds.

The assessment is based on the detonation-driven 304L steel spherical-cap fragmentation experiments of Campbell et al. (2007). Metrics used for purposes of validation include the velocity history of a witness point of the shell and the histogram of recovered fragment sizes. The results of the simulations are found to be in overall good agreement with the experimental measurements, especially when allowances are made for uncertainties in the characterization of the drive and material properties. The ability of the approach to predictively simulate exceedingly complex patterns of fracture and fragmentation under severe conditions of loading and material behavior is remarkable, especially in consideration of the simplicity of the fracture model and its implementation.

The ATLAS(3D) project - XXIX. The new look of early-type galaxies and surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						techniques: photometric; galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD; galaxies: interactions; galaxies: photometry; galaxies: stellar content	GENERATION VIRGO CLUSTER; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; TO-LIGHT RATIO; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; STELLAR HALOS; H-I; ATLAS3D PROJECT; SAURON PROJECT; TIDAL FEATURES; DWARF GALAXIES	Galactic archaeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct the past mass assembly of Local Group galaxies. The development of new observing techniques and data reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field of view cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxies exploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (LSB) light. As part of the ATLAS(3D) project, we have obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope extremely deep, multiband images of nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs). We present here a catalogue of 92 galaxies from the ATLAS(3D) sample, which are located in low-to medium-density environments. The observing strategy and data reduction pipeline, which achieve a gain of several magnitudes in the limiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, are presented. The size and depth of the survey are compared to other recent deep imaging projects. The paper highlights the capability of LSB-optimized surveys at detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology of galaxies. The intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are also discussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar haloes of galaxies by extended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from Galactic dust. The detection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present and past mass assembly of ETGs are one of the prime goals of the project. We provide specific examples of each type of observed structures - tidal tails, stellar streams and shells - and explain how they were identified and classified. We give an overview of the initial results. The detailed statistical analysis will be presented in future papers.

Their long-term light curves have been poorly understood due to the few systems known and the long (hundreds of days) recurrence times between outbursts. We present combined photometric light curves from the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research, Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and Palomar Transient Factory synoptic surveys to study the photometric variability of these systems over an almost 10 yr period. These light curves provide a much clearer picture of the outburst phenomena that these systems undergo. We characterize the photometric behaviour of most known outbursting AM CVn systems and establish a relation between their outburst properties and the systems' orbital periods. We also explore why some systems have only shown a single outburst so far and expand the previously accepted phenomenological states of AM CVn systems. We conclude that the outbursts of these systems show evolution with respect to the orbital period, which can likely be attributed to the decreasing mass transfer rate with increasing period. Finally, we consider the number of AM CVn systems that should be present in modelled synoptic surveys.

Deuterium enrichment of ammonia produced by surface N plus H/D addition reactions at low temperature	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						astrochemistry; solid state: volatile; methods: laboratory; ISM: atoms; ISM: molecules; infrared: ISM	AMORPHOUS SOLID WATER; DEUTERATED AMMONIA; CO DEPLETION; H-ATOMS; DISSOCIATIVE RECOMBINATION; INFRARED-SPECTRA; HYDROGEN-ATOMS; DUST GRAINS; N-2 MATRIX; ICE	The surface formation of NH3 and its deuterated isotopologues - NH2D, NHD2, and ND3 - is investigated at low temperatures through the simultaneous addition of hydrogen and deuterium atoms to nitrogen atoms in CO-rich interstellar ice analogues. The formation of all four ammonia isotopologues is only observed up to 15 K, and drops below the detection limit for higher temperatures. Differences between hydrogenation and deuteration yields result in a clear deviation from a statistical distribution in favour of deuterium enriched species. The data analysis suggests that this is due to a higher sticking probability of D atoms to the cold surface, a property that may generally apply to molecules that are formed in low temperature surface reactions. The results found here are used to interpret ammonia-deuterium fractionation as observed in pre-protostellar cores.

Iron K and Compton hump reverberation in SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365 revealed by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						black hole physics; galaxies: active; X-rays: galaxies	X-RAY REVERBERATION; ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; LINE SEYFERT-1 ARK-564; BLACK-HOLE MASS; TIME-LAGS; CYGNUS X-1; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; TIMING PROPERTIES; LIGHT CURVES	In the past five years, a flurry of X-ray reverberation lag measurements of accreting supermassive black holes have been made using the XMM-Newton telescope in the 0.3-10 keV energy range. In this work, we use the NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array) telescope to extend the lag analysis up to higher energies for two Seyfert galaxies, SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365. X-ray reverberation lags are due to the light travel time delays between the direct continuum emission and the reprocessed emission from the inner radii of an ionized accretion disc. XMM-Newton has been particularly adept at measuring the lag associated with the broad Fe K emission line, where the gravitationally redshifted wing of the line is observed to respond before the line centroid at 6.4 keV, produced at larger radii. Now, we use NuSTAR to probe the lag at higher energies, where the spectrum shows clear evidence for Compton reflection, known as the Compton 'hump'. The XMM-Newton data show Fe K lags in both SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC 1365. The NuSTAR data provide independent confirmation of these Fe K lags, and also show evidence for the corresponding Compton hump lags, especially in SWIFT J2127.4+5654. These broad-band lag measurements confirm that the Compton hump and Fe K lag are produced at small radii. At low frequencies in NGC 1365, where the spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we find a clear negative (not positive) lag from 2 to 10 keV, which can be understood as the decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of our line of sight during the observation.

Modelling the extreme X-ray spectrum of IRAS 13224-3809	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						accretion, accretion discs; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; LINE SEYFERT-1 GALAXY-1H-0707-495; BLACK-HOLE; XMM-NEWTON; ACCRETION DISKS; IRON K; RAPID VARIABILITY; LENSED QUASAR; 1H 0707-495; REFLECTION	The extreme narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 shows significant variability, frequency-dependent time lags, and strong Fe K line and Fe L features in the long 2011 XMM-Newton observation. In this work, we study the spectral properties of IRAS 13224-3809 in detail, and carry out a series of analyses to probe the nature of the source, focusing in particular on the spectral variability exhibited. The reflection grating spectrometer spectrum shows no obvious signatures of absorption by partially ionized material ('warm' absorbers). We fit the 0.3-10.0 keV spectra with a model that includes relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disc, a standard power-law active galactic nucleus continuum, and a low-temperature (similar to 0.1 keV) blackbody, which may originate in the accretion disc, either as direct or reprocessed thermal emission. We find that the reflection model explains the time-averaged spectrum well, and we also undertake flux-resolved and time-resolved spectral analyses, which provide evidence of gravitational light-bending effects. Additionally, the temperature and flux of the blackbody component are found to follow the L alpha T-4 relation expected for simple thermal blackbody emission from a constant emitting area, indicating a physical origin for this component.

Functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles for controlling the movement of immune cells	NANOSCALE			English	Article							GOLD NANOPARTICLES; MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; CPG IMMUNOTHERAPY; DRUG-DELIVERY; STEM-CELLS; CANCER; DNA; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS; SYSTEM	Immunotherapy is currently being investigated for the treatment of many diseases, including cancer. The ability to control the location of immune cells during or following activation would represent a powerful new technique for this field. Targeted magnetic delivery is emerging as a technique for controlling cell movement and localization. Here we show that this technique can be extended to microglia, the primary phagocytic immune cells in the central nervous system. The magnetized microglia were generated by loading the cells with iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with CpG oligonucleotides, serving as a proof of principle that nanoparticles can be used to both deliver an immunostimulatory cargo to cells and to control the movement of the cells. The nanoparticle-oligonucleotide conjugates are efficiently internalized, non-toxic, and immunostimulatory. We demonstrate that the in vitro migration of the adherent, loaded microglia can be controlled by an external magnetic field and that magnetically-induced migration is non-cytotoxic. In order to capture video of this magnetically-induced migration of loaded cells, a novel 3D-printed "cell box" was designed to facilitate our imaging application. Analysis of cell movement velocities clearly demonstrate increased cell velocities toward the magnet. These studies represent the initial step towards our final goal of using nanoparticles to both activate immune cells and to control their trafficking within the diseased brain.

Here we explore the role of coding variation on these traits by analysis of variants on the HumanExome BeadChip in 60,564 non-diabetic individuals and in 16,491 T2D cases and 81,877 controls. We identify a novel association of a low-frequency nonsynonymous SNV in GLP1R (A316T; rs10305492; MAF = 1.4%) with lower FG (beta = -0.09 +/- 0.01 mmol l(-1), P = 3.4 x 10(-12)), T2D risk (OR[95% CI] = 0.86[0.76-0.96], P = 0.010), early insulin secretion (beta = -0.07 +/- 0.035 pmol(insulin) mmol(glucose)(-1), P = 0.048), but higher 2-h glucose (beta = 0.16 +/- 0.05 mmol l(-1), P = 4.3 x 10(-4)). We identify a gene-based association with FG at G6PC2 (p(SKAT) = 6.8 x 10(-6)) driven by four rare protein-coding SNVs (H177Y, Y207S, R283X and S324P). We identify rs651007 (MAF = 20%) in the first intron of ABO at the putative promoter of an antisense lncRNA, associating with higher FG (beta = 0.02 +/- 0.004 mmol l(-1), P = 1.3 x 10(-8)). Our approach identifies novel coding variant associations and extends the allelic spectrum of variation underlying diabetes-related quantitative traits and T2D susceptibility.

The introduction of a high-Q cavity in silicon as an integral part of the laser's resonator leads to major reduction of the laser linewidth. However, the large intra-cavity field intensity resulting from the high-Q operation gives rise to non-linear effects. We present a theoretical model based on non-linear rate equations to study the effect of two-photon absorption and induced free-carrier absorption in silicon on the laser's performance. The predictions from this model are compared to the experimental results obtained from narrow-linewidth lasers fabricated by us.

A compact ultra-clean system for deploying radioactive sources inside the KamLAND detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article						Large detector systems for particle and astroparticle physics; Detector alignment and calibration methods (lasers; Sources, Particle-beams); Scintillators, Scintillation and light emission processes (solid, Gas and liquid scintillators)		We describe a compact, ultra-clean device used to deploy radioactive sources along the vertical axis of the KamLAND liquid-scintillator neutrino detector for purposes of calibration. The device worked by paying out and reeling in precise lengths of a hanging, small-gauge wire rope (cable); an assortment of interchangeable radioactive sources could be attached to a weight at the end of the cable. All components exposed to the radiopure liquid scintillator were made of chemically compatible UHV-cleaned materials, primarily stainless steel, in order to avoid contaminating or degrading the scintillator. To prevent radon intrusion, the apparatus was enclosed in a hermetically sealed housing inside a glove box, and both volumes were regularly flushed with purified nitrogen gas. An infrared camera attached to the side of the housing permitted real-Lime visual monitoring of the cable's motion, and the system was controlled via a graphical user interface.

Thermal relaxation of lithium dendrites	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							IN-SITU; LIQUID ELECTROLYTES; ELECTROCHEMICAL DEPOSITION; RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES; SURFACE-DIFFUSION; GROWTH; ELECTRODEPOSITION; DENSITY; MORPHOLOGY; DYNAMICS	The average lengths (lambda) over bar of lithium dendrites produced by charging symmetric Li-0 batteries at various temperatures are matched by Monte Carlo computations dealing both with Li+ transport in the electrolyte and thermal relaxation of Li-0 electrodeposits. We found that experimental (lambda) over bar (T) variations cannot be solely accounted by the temperature dependence of Li+ mobility in the solvent but require the involvement of competitive Li-atom transport from metastable dendrite tips to smoother domains over Delta E-R(double dagger) similar to 20 kJ mol(-1) barriers. A transition state theory analysis of Li-atom diffusion in solids yields a negative entropy of activation for the relaxation process: Delta S-R(double dagger) approximate to -46 J mol(-1) K-1 that is consistent with the transformation of amorphous into crystalline Li-0 electrodeposits. Significantly, our Delta E-R(double dagger) similar to 20 kJ mol(-1) value compares favorably with the activation barriers recently derived from DFT calculations for self-diffusion on Li-0(001) and (111) crystal surfaces. Our findings suggest a key role for the mobility of interfacial Li-atoms in determining the morphology of dendrites at temperatures above the onset of surface reconstruction: T-SR approximate to 0.65 T-MB (T-MB = 453 K: the melting point of bulk Li-0).

Electrochemical behavior of thin-film Sm-doped ceria: insights from the point-contact configuration	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							OXIDE FUEL-CELLS; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; REACTION-MECHANISMS; REFERENCE ELECTRODE; MIXED CONDUCTORS; CERMET ANODE; PERFORMANCE; POLARIZATION; MODEL; RESISTANCE	The electrochemical behavior of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown porous films of Sm-doped ceria (SDC) for hydrogen oxidation has been evaluated by impedance spectroscopy using a point contact geometry at a temperature of 650 degrees C. Porous SDC films, 950 nm in thickness, were deposited on both sides of single-crystal YSZ(100). Pt paste was applied over the surface of one SDC layer to create a highactivity counter electrode. Ni wire was contacted to the surface of the other SDC layer to create a limited contact-area working electrode. The active area of contact at the working electrode was determined using the Newman equation and the electrolyte constriction impedance. The radius of this area varied from 5 to 18 mm, depending on gas composition and bias. The area-normalized electrode impedance (where the area was that determined as described above) varied from 0.03 to 0.17 Omega cm(2) and generally decreased with cathodic bias and decreasing oxygen partial pressure. From an analysis of the dimensions of the active area with bias, it was found that the majority of the overpotential occurred at the SDC vertical bar gas interface rather than the SDC vertical bar YSZ interface. Overall, the anode overpotential is found to be extremely small, competitive with the best oxide anodes reported in the literature. Nevertheless, the impedance falls in line with expected values based on extrapolations of the properties of dense, flat SDC model electrodes grown by pulsed laser deposition (Chueh et al., Nat. Mater., 2012). The results demonstrate that, with suitable fabrication approaches, exceptional activity can be achieved with SDC for hydrogen electrooxidation even in the absence of metal-oxide-gas triple phase boundaries.

Here we analyze the behavior of asymmetrical connected networks of linear threshold neurons, whose positive response is unbounded. We show that, for a wide range of parameters, this asymmetry brings interesting and computationally useful dynamical properties. When driven by input, the network explores potential solutions through highly unstable 'expansion' dynamics. This expansion is steered and constrained by negative divergence of the dynamics, which ensures that the dimensionality of the solution space continues to reduce until an acceptable solution manifold is reached. Then the system contracts stably on this manifold towards its final solution trajectory. The unstable positive feedback and cross inhibition that underlie expansion and divergence are common motifs in molecular and neuronal networks. Therefore we propose that very simple organizational constraints that combine these motifs can lead to spontaneous computation and so to the spontaneous modification of entropy that is characteristic of living systems.

The functional form of these aberrations, called polarization aberrations, result from the angles of incidence and the variations of the coatings as a function of angle. These coatings induce small modifications to the PSF, which consists of four separate components, two nearly Airy-disk PSF components, and two faint components, we call ghost PSF components, with a spatial extent about twice the size of the diffraction limited image. As the specifications of optical systems constantly improve, these small effects become increasingly important. It is shown how the magnitude of these ghost PSF components, at similar to 10(-5) in the example telescope, can interfere with exoplanet detection with coronagraphs.

PROBING EUROPA'S INTERIOR WITH NATURAL SOUND SOURCES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 12-16, 2015	Florence, ITALY					Europa's interior structure may be determined by relatively simple and robust seismo-acoustic echo sounding techniques [Probing Europa's Interior with Natural Sound Sources, Icarus, 165, 144-167, (2003)]. The strategy is to use ice cracking events or impacts that are hypothesized to occur regularly on Europa's surface as sources of opportunity. A single passive geophone on Europa's surface may then be used to estimate the thickness of its ice shell and the depth of its ocean by measuring the travel time of seismo-acoustic reflections from the corresponding internal strata. Quantitative analysis is presented with full-field seismo-acoustic modeling of the Europan environment. This includes models for Europan ambient noise and conditions on signal-to-noise ratio necessary for the proposed technique to be feasible. The possibility of determining Europa's ice layer thickness by surface wave and modal analysis with a single geophone is also investigated.

Evidence for liquid water in Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, and in Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus, indicates that characteristic depths are 100s of km. Bottom pressures can exceed 1.5 GPa, well into the stability range for high-pressure ice phases III, V, and VI. Considering the thermodynamics of salty fluids leads to predictions of truly alien "climate" in such worlds, in which ices either float or sink. As demonstrated here, presently available sound speed data would allow for seismic detection of such features. Determining the dynamics of deep extraterrestrial oceans is a modeling task requiring new thermodynamic data from acoustic measurements. Future planetary exploration missions could provide opportunities in the coming decades to characterize these oceans using acoustic methods.

Towards the Implementation of a GNSS-Based Tsunami Early Warning System Using Ionospheric Measurements	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 28TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS+ 2015)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	28th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS+)	SEP 14-18, 2015	Tampa, FL	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div			ELECTRON-CONTENT; EARTHQUAKE; WAVES	Natural hazards and solid Earth events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions are actual sources that may trigger acoustic and gravity waves resulting in traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) in the upper atmosphere. Trans-ionospheric radio wave measurements sense the total electron content (TEC) along the signal propagation path. In this research, we introduce a novel GPS-based detection and estimation technique for remote sensing of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs including space weather phenomena induced by major natural hazard events, using TEC time series collected from worldwide ground-based dual-frequency GNSS (including GPS) receiver networks. We demonstrate the ability of using ground-and space-based dual-frequency GPS measurements to detect and monitor tsunami wave propagation from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and tsunami. Major wave trains with different propagation speeds and wavelengths were identified through analysis of the GPS remote sensing observations. Dominant physical characteristics of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs are found to be associated with specific tsunami propagations and oceanic Rayleigh waves. In this research, we focus on the analysis of tsunami-induced TIDs observed from the U.S. west coast. We compared GPS-based observations, corresponding model simulations and tsunami wave propagation. Results are shown to lead to a better understanding of the tsunami-induced ionosphere responses. Based on current distribution of Plate Boundary Observatory GPS stations, the results indicate that tsunami-induced TIDs may be detected about 60 minutes prior to tsunamis arriving at the U.S. west coast. It is expected that this GNSS-based technology will become an integral part of future early-warning systems.	[Yang, Y-M.; Komjathy, A.; Meng, X.; Verkhoglyadova, Olga; Mannucci, A.

The Rosetta orbiter has 11 scientific instruments (4 remote sensing) and the Philae lander to make complementary measurements of the comet nucleus, coma (gas and dust), and surrounding environment. The ESA Rosetta Science Ground Segment has developed a science scheduling system that includes an automated scheduling capability to assist in developing science plans for the Rosetta Orbiter. While automated scheduling is a small portion of the overall Science Ground Segment (SGS) as well as the overall scheduling system, this paper focuses on the automated and semi-automated scheduling software (called ASPEN-RSSC) and how this software is used.

Motivated by a pattern decomposition problem in materials discovery, aimed at discovering new materials for renewable energy, e.g. for fuel and solar cells, we introduce CombiFD, a framework for factor based pattern decomposition that allows the incorporation of a-priori knowledge as constraints, including complex combinatorial constraints. In addition, we propose a new pattern decomposition algorithm, called AMIQO, based on solving a sequence of (mixed-integer) quadratic programs. Our approach considerably outperforms the state of the art on the materials discovery problem, scaling to larger datasets and recovering more precise and physically meaningful decompositions. We also show the effectiveness of our approach for enforcing background knowledge on other application domains.

We focus on high-dimensional sensor data with a specific case study of spectroscopic mapping. A field robot refines an orbital image by measuring the surface at many wavelengths. We introduce a new objective function based on spectral unmixing that seeks pure spectral signatures to accurately model diluted remote signals. This objective reflects physical properties of the multi-wavelength data. The rover visits locations that jointly improve its model of the environment while satisfying time and energy constraints. We simulate exploration using alternative planning approaches, and show proof of concept results with the canonical spectroscopic map of a mining district in Cuprite, Nevada.

Fast temperature spectrometer for samples under extreme conditions	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							DIAMOND-ANVIL CELL; LASER-HEATING SYSTEM; NUCLEAR RESONANT SCATTERING; HIGH-PRESSURE RESEARCH; IRON; CORE	We have developed a multi-wavelength Fast Temperature Readout (FasTeR) spectrometer to capture a sample's transient temperature fluctuations, and reduce uncertainties in melting temperature determination. Without sacrificing accuracy, FasTeR features a fast readout rate (about 100 Hz), high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and a well-constrained focus. Complimenting a charge-coupled device spectrometer, FasTeR consists of an array of photomultiplier tubes and optical dichroic filters. The temperatures determined by FasTeR outside of the vicinity of melting are, generally, in good agreement with results from the charge-coupled device spectrometer. Near melting, FasTeR is capable of capturing transient temperature fluctuations, at least on the order of 300 K/s. A software tool, SIMFaster, is described and has been developed to simulate FasTeR and assess design configurations. FasTeR is especially suitable for temperature determinations that utilize ultra-fast techniques under extreme conditions. Working in parallel with the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell, synchrotron Mossbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we have applied the FasTeR spectrometer to measure the melting temperature of (Fe0.9Ni0.1)-Fe-57 at high pressure.

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity under visible light irradiation with respect to bleaching of methylene blue (MB) and degradation of phenol were determined. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the composite material, g-C3N4/Bi2O3/TiO2-NT, was red-shifted toward a narrower band gap energy (E-g). The valence band (VB) of g-C3N4/Bi2O3/TiO2-NT was shifted to a more positive potential resulting in an increased driving force for water oxidation. The photocurrent generated by g-C3N4/Bi2O3/TiO2-NTs was approximately 15 times higher and the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE at lambda = 400 nm) was higher than that of the naked TiO2-NTs. This response is attributed to increasing the lifetimes of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. A significantly higher PEC response in terms of the bleaching of MB was observed on g-C3N4/Bi2O3/TiO2-NT. The roles of improved charge separation and subsequent higher electron-transfer efficiencies for in g-C3N4/Bi2O3/TiO2-NT electrodes were examined.

A global database of lake surface temperatures collected by in situ and satellite methods from 1985-2009	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article								Global environmental change has influenced lake surface temperatures, a key driver of ecosystem structure and function. Recent studies have suggested significant warming of water temperatures in individual lakes across many different regions around the world. However, the spatial and temporal coherence associated with the magnitude of these trends remains unclear. Thus, a global data set of water temperature is required to understand and synthesize global, long-term trends in surface water temperatures of inland bodies of water. We assembled a database of summer lake surface temperatures for 291 lakes collected in situ and/or by satellites for the period 1985-2009. In addition, corresponding climatic drivers (air temperatures, solar radiation, and cloud cover) and geomorphometric characteristics (latitude, longitude, elevation, lake surface area, maximum depth, mean depth, and volume) that influence lake surface temperatures were compiled for each lake. This unique dataset offers an invaluable baseline perspective on global-scale lake thermal conditions as environmental change continues.

We thank Tim Kratz for helping with the initiation of this project. The Lake Baikal data are part of a dataset (No. 2005620028) registered with the government of the Russian Federation and collected by many Irkutsk State University staff, now supported by Russian Ministry of Education and Science, research project GR 01201461929, National Science Foundation (DEB-1136637) supported additional data management. Data for the Austrian lakes were extracted from the year books of the Austrian Hydrological Survey, Department IV/4-Water cycle, Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management. The daily time series from Lake Vattern since 1955 was prepared and provided by Vattern's Water Protection Association. Dorset Environmental Science Centre lakes have been sampled under the supervision of two senior technicians, Robert Girard and Ron Ingram, and two research scientists, Norman Yan and Andrew Paterson. Data for the New York City drinking water reservoirs were sampled and provided by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP). Data for Lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv were provided by the Estonian Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Some of the data for Loch Leven have been published by Dudley et al. (2013). Data for Plusssee were collected by the Max-Planck-Institute for Limnology, Ploen until 2006. Data from the Swiss lakes were kindly provided by the City of Zurich Water Supply (WVZ) and by the Amt fur Abfall, Wasser, Energie und Luft (AWEL) of the Canton of Zurich. Data for Lakes Annecy, Bourget and Geneva are from the Information System of the SOERE OLA, INRA Thonon les Bains, CIPEL, CISALB, SILA. Data for Lake Constance were provided by the Institut fur Seenforschung, Langenargen (Intenationale Gewasserschutzkommission fur den Bodensee - IGKB). Sudbury area lakes have been sampled by the Cooperative Freshwater Ecology Unit at Laurentian University, under the supervision of two research scientists, Bill Keller and Norman Yan.

A crucial roadblock to achieving predictable performance is stragglers, i.e., tasks that take significantly longer than expected to run. At this point, speculative execution has been widely adopted to mitigate the impact of stragglers. However, speculation mechanisms are designed and operated independently of job scheduling when, in fact, scheduling a speculative copy of a task has a direct impact on the resources available for other jobs. In this work, we present Hopper, a job scheduler that is speculation aware, i.e., that integrates the tradeoffs associated with speculation into job scheduling decisions. We implement both centralized and decentralized prototypes of the Hopper scheduler and show that 50% (66%) improvements over state-of-the-art centralized (decentralized) schedulers and speculation strategies can be achieved through the coordination of scheduling and speculation.

Celebrating Soft Matter's 10th Anniversary: Chain configuration and rate-dependent mechanical properties in transient networks	SOFT MATTER			English	Article							BROWNIAN DYNAMICS SIMULATION; ASSOCIATIVE POLYMERS; SHEAR; HYDROGELS; DESIGN; EQUILIBRIUM; RHEOLOGY; MODEL	Numerical solution of a coupled set of Smoluchowski convection-diffusion equations of associating polymers modelled as finitely extensible dumbbells enables computation of time-dependent end-to-end distributions for bridged, dangling, and looped chains in three dimensions as a function of associating end-group kinetics. Non-monotonic flow curves which can lead to flow instabilities during shear flow result at low equilibrium constant and high association rate from two complementary phenomena: a decrease in the fraction of elastically active chains with increasing shear rate and non-monotonic extension in the population of elastically active chains. Chain tumbling leads to reformation of bridges, resulting in an increased fraction of bridged chains at high Deborah number and significant reduction in the average bridge chain extension. In the start-up of steady shear, force-activated chain dissociation and chain tumbling cause both stress overshoot and stress ringing behaviour prior to reaching steady state stress values. During stress relaxation following steady shear, chain kinetics and extension mediate both the number of relaxations and the length of time required for system relaxation. While at low association rate relaxation is limited by the relaxation of dangling chains and the rate of dangling chain formation, at high association rate coupling of dangling and bridged chains leads to simultaneous relaxation of all chains due to a dynamic equilibrium between dangling and bridged states.

An intermediate volume fraction colloid-polymer gel is used as a model system, allowing quantification of the interplay between interparticle attractions and shear forces. Rheometry, confocal microscopy and Brownian dynamics reveal that high shear rates, fully breaking the structure, lead after shear cessation to more homogeneous and stronger gels, whereas preshear at low rates creates largely heterogeneous weaker gels with reduced elasticity. We find that in comparison, thermal quenching cannot produce structural inhomogeneities under shear. We argue that external shear has strong implications on routes towards metastable equilibrium, and therefore gelation scenarios. Moreover, these results have strong implications for material design and industrial applications, such as mixing, processing and transport protocols coupled to the properties of the final material.

KOI-3158: The oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets	SPACE PHOTOMETRY REVOLUTION - COROT SYMPOSIUM 3, KEPLER KASC-7 JOINT MEETING	EPJ Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	Symposium 3 on Space Photometry Revolution - CoRoT / Kepler KASC-7 Joint Meeting	JUL 06-11, 2014	Toulouse, FRANCE				CANDIDATES; MASS	The first discoveries of exoplanets around Sun-like stars have fueled efforts to find ever smaller worlds evocative of Earth and other terrestrial planets in the Solar System. While gas-giant planets appear to form preferentially around metal-rich stars, small planets (with radii less than four Earth radii) can form under a wide range of metallicities. This implies that small, including Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's history when metals were far less abundant. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of KOI-3158, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic thick disk, which hosts five planets with sizes between Mercury and Venus. We used asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of 11.2 +/- 1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that KOI-3158 formed when the Universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history, providing scope for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.	[Campante, T.

We propose functions of them that account for different variables' units; these alternative figures of merit are closely tied to simultaneous multivariate inference on an unknown parameter vector or unknown state vector. Their usefulness is illustrated in a simulation experiment, where the goal is to determine the statistical properties associated with prediction of a multivariate state.

However, standard approaches to such tests are unable to quantify the preference for one cosmology over another. We advocate a Bayesian approach whereby the parameters defining the scaling relation between Einstein radii and cluster mass are treated as the observables. We demonstrate a method of estimating the likelihood for observing these parameters under the Lambda CDM framework, using the X-ray selected z > 0.5 MACS clusters as a case in point and employing both N-body and hydrodynamic simulations of clusters.

However, from the early nineteenth century until the beginning of the twenty-first the two disciplines have been somewhat estranged - there was no formal relationship between the two. This has now changed, as is evidenced by the recent creation of the International Astrostatistics Association (IAA), the ISI astrostatistics committee, astrostatistics working groups authorized by the IAU and AAS, and this Symposium. The challenge for us to come is in establishing how statisticians and astronomers relate in developing the discipline of astrostatistics. I shall propose a direction for how the discipline can progress in both the short term and well as for future generations of astrostatisticians.

The theorem states that given a set of vectors X in Rd, for every vector in the convex hull of X there exists an s-close (under the p-norm distance, for 2 < p < co) vector that can be expressed as a convex combination of at most b vectors of X, where the bound b depends on s and the norm p and is independent of the dimension d. This theorem can be derived by instantiating Maurey's lemma, early references to which can be found in the work of Pisier (1981) and Carl (1985). However, in this paper we present a self-contained proof of this result. Using this theorem we establish that in a bimatrix game with n x n payoff matrices A, B, if the number of non-zero entries in any column of A+ B is at most s then an s-Nash o (log s equilibrium of the game can be computed in time n. This, in particular, gives us a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Nash equilibrium in games with fixed column sparsity s. Moreover, for arbitrary bimatrix games since s can be at most n the running time of our algorithm matches the best-known upper bound, which was obtained by Lipton, Markakis, and Mehta (2003). The approximate Caratheodory's theorem also leads to an additive approximation algorithm for the densest k-bipartite subgraph problem. Given a graph with n vertices and maximum degree d, the developed algorithm determines a k x k bipartite subgraph with density within s (in the additive 0 (log d)	[Barman, Siddharth] CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA	Barman, S (corresponding author), CALTECH, 1200 E Calif Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.	barman@caltech.edu			NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-0846025, CCF-1101470]; Linde/SISL postdoctoral fellowship	The author thanks Federico Echenique, Katrina Ligett, Assaf Naor, Aviad Rubinstein, Anthony Man-Cho So, and Joel Tropp for helpful discussions and references.

Specifically, the model to be learned, V, is a probability distribution over probability distributions p, where each such p is a probability distribution over [n] = {1, 2,..., n}. When we sample from V, we do not observe p directly, but only indirectly and in very noisy fashion, by sampling from [n] repeatedly, independently K times from the distribution p. The problem is to infer 19 to high accuracy in transportation (earthmover) distance. We give the first efficient algorithms for learning this mixture model without making any restricting assumptions on the structure of the distribution V. We bound the quality of the solution as a function of the size of the samples K and the number of samples used. Our model and results have applications to a variety of unsupervised learning scenarios, including learning topic models and collaborative filtering.

This algorithm, which goes back to Osborne and Parlett & Reinsch in the 1960s, is implemented as a standard preconditioner in many numerical linear algebra packages. Surprisingly, despite its widespread use over several decades, no bounds were known on its rate of convergence. In this paper we prove that, for a large class of irreducible n x n (real or complex) input matrices A, a natural variant of the algorithm converges in O(n(3) log(n rho/epsilon)) elementary balancing operations, where rho measures the initial imbalance of A and epsilon is the target imbalance of the output matrix. (The imbalance of A is max(i) vertical bar log (a(i)(out)/a(i)(in))vertical bar, where a(i)(out), a(i)(in) are the maximum entries in magnitude in the ith row and column respectively.) This bound is tight up to the log n factor. A balancing operation scales the ith row and column so that their maximum entries are equal, and requires O(m/n) arithmetic operations on average, where m is the number of non-zero elements in A. Thus the running time of the iterative algorithm is (O) over tilde (n(2)m). This is the first time bound of any kind on any variant of the Osborne-Parlett-Reinsch algorithm. The class of matrices for which the above analysis holds are those which satisfy a condition we call Unique Balance, meaning that the limit of the iterative balancing process does not depend on the order in which balancing operations are performed. We also prove a combinatorial characterization of the Unique Balance property, which had earlier been conjectured by Chen.

The AFTA coronagraph also matures direct imaging technologies to high TRL for an Exo-Earth Imager in the next decade. The coronagraph Design Reference Mission (DRM) optical design is based on the highly successful High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT), with modifications to accommodate the AFTA telescope design, service-ability, volume constraints, and the addition of an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). In order to optimally satisfy the three science objectives of planet imaging, planet spectral characterization and dust debris imaging, the coronagraph is designed to operate in two different modes: Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph or Shaped Pupil Coronagraph. Active mechanisms change pupil masks, focal plane masks, Lyot masks, and bandpass filters to shift between modes. A single optical beam train can thus operate alternatively as two different coronagraph architectures. Structural Thermal Optical Performance (STOP) analysis predicts the instrument contrast with the Low Order Wave Front Control loop closed. The STOP analysis was also used to verify that the optical/structural/thermal design provides the extreme stability required for planet characterization in the presence of thermal disturbances expected in a typical observing scenario. This paper describes the instrument design and the flow down from science requirements to high level engineering requirements.

With its modest size, Exo-S bridges the gap between census missions like Kepler and a future space-based flagship direct imaging exoplanet mission. With the ability to reach down to Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of nearly two dozen nearby stars, Exo-S is a powerful first step in the search for and identification of Earth-like planets. Compelling science can be returned at the same time as the technological and scientific framework is developed for a larger flagship mission. The Exo-S Science and Technology Definition Team studied two viable starshade-telescope missions for exoplanet direct imaging, targeted to the $1B cost guideline. The first Exo-S mission concept is a starshade and telescope system dedicated to each other for the sole purpose of direct imaging for exoplanets (The "Starshade Dedicated Mission"). The starshade and commercial, 1.1-m diameter telescope co-launch, sharing the same low-cost launch vehicle, conserving cost. The Dedicated mission orbits in a heliocentric, Earth leading, Earth-drift away orbit. The telescope has a conventional instrument package that includes the planet camera, a basic spectrometer, and a guide camera. The second Exo-S mission concept is a starshade that launches separately to rendezvous with an existing on-orbit space telescope (the "Starshade Rendezvous Mission"). The existing telescope adopted for the study is the WFIRST-AFTA (Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope Astrophysics Focused Telescope Asset). The WFIRST-AFTA 2.4-m telescope is assumed to have previously launched to a Halo orbit about the Earth-Sun L2 point, away from the gravity gradient of Earth orbit which is unsuitable for formation flying of the starshade and telescope. The impact on WFIRST-AFTA for starshade readiness is minimized; the existing coronagraph instrument performs as the starshade science instrument, while formation guidance is handled by the existing coronagraph focal planes with minimal modification and an added transceiver.

Our framework generalizes standard accounts of causal learning to settings in which the causal variables need to be constructed from micro-variables. We prove the Causal Coarsening Theorem, which allows us to gain causal knowledge from observational data with minimal experimental effort. The theorem provides a connection to standard inference techniques in machine learning that identify features of an image that correlate with, but may not cause, the target behavior. Finally, we propose an active learning scheme to learn a manipulator function that performs optimal manipulations on the image to automatically identify the visual cause of a target behavior. We illustrate our inference and learning algorithms in experiments based on both synthetic and real data.

In this article we bridge the gap between causal structure discovery and the do-calculus by proposing a method for the identification of causal effects on the basis of arbitrary (equivalence) classes of semi-Markovian causal models. The approach uses a general logical representation of the equivalence class of graphs obtained from a causal structure discovery algorithm, the properties of which can then be queried by procedures implementing the do-calculus inference for causal effects. We show that the method is more efficient than determining causal effects using a naive enumeration of graphs in the equivalence class. Moreover, the method is complete with respect to the identifiability of causal effects for settings, in which extant methods that do not require knowledge of the true graph, offer only incomplete results. The method is entirely modular and easily adapted for different background settings.

J	Aria, AI; Lyon, BJ; Gharib, M				Aria, Adrianus I.; Lyon, Bradley J.; Gharib, Morteza			Morphology engineering of hollow carbon nanotube pillars by oxygen plasma treatment	CARBON			English	Article							FIELD-EMISSION; RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; GRAPHENE; ARRAYS; FUNCTIONALIZATION; FILMS; VACUUM; O-2	Oxygen plasma treatment is introduced herein as a novel post-growth fabrication technique to engineer the macroscopic morphology of hollow carbon nanotube (CNT) pillars. Current fabrication techniques for patterned vertically-aligned CNTs only allow for the production of extruded structures with constant cross-sectional area. Oxygen plasma treatment is utilized to rectify this limitation by introducing variation to the cross-sectional area. The results presented herein demonstrate that a conical geometry can be successfully introduced by oxygen plasma treatment to a hollow cylindrical CNT pillar. Using oxygen plasma treatment, the blunt tip of a cylindrical CNT pillar can be controllably sharpened until it reaches a size reduction of more than 93%. A geometric model is presented herein to predict the morphology transformation of a hollow cylindrical CNT pillar during the oxygen plasma treatment. Three distinct phases of CNT structural and morphological evolution induced by oxygen plasma treatment are also identified. A mild CNT functionalization by oxygen adsorbates occurs in the first phase. The second phase is indicated by drastic changes in the macroscopic morphology of CNT pillars. Structural amorphization and collapse of the base of the CNT pillars take place in the final phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Insights into their composition, hydration state, & structure	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids; Asteroids, composition; Asteroids, surfaces	MAIN-BELT ASTEROIDS; 21 LUTETIA; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SURFACE-COMPOSITION; SPECTRAL PROPERTIES; DARK MATERIAL; SHAPE MODELS; VESTA; METEORITE; WATER	Using the S-band radar at Arecibo Observatory, we observed thirteen X/M-class asteroids; nine were previously undetected and four were re-observed, bringing the total number of Tholen X/M-class asteroids observed with radar to 29. Of these 29M-class asteroids, 13 are also W-class, defined as M-class objects that also display a 3-mu m absorption feature which is often interpreted as the signature of hydrated minerals (Jones, T.D., Lebofsky, LA., Lewis, J.S., Marley, M.S. [1990]. Icarus 88, 172-192; Rivkin, A.S., Howell, E.S., Britt, D.T., Lebofsky, LA., Nolan, M.C., Branston, D.D. [1995]. Icarus 117,90-100; Rivkin, A.S., Howell, E.S., Lebofsky, LA., Clark, B.E., Britt, D.T. [2000]. Icarus 145, 351-368). Consistent with our previous work (Shepard, M.K. et al. [2008]. Icarus 195, 184-205; Shepard, M.K., Harris, A.W., Taylor, P.A., Clark, B.E., Ockert-Bell, M., Nolan, M.C., Howell, E.S., Magri, C., Giorgini, J.D., Benner, L.A.M. [2011]. Icarus 215, 547-551), we find that 38% of our sample (11 of 29) have radar albedos consistent with metal-dominated compositions. With the exception of 83 Beatrix and 572 Rebekka, the remaining objects have radar albedos significantly higher than the mean S-or C-class asteroid (Magri, C., Nolan, M.C., Ostro, Sj., Giorgini, J.D. [2007]. Icarus 186, 126-151). Seven of the eleven high-radar-albedo asteroids, or 64%, also display a 3-mu m absorption feature (Wclass) which is thought to be inconsistent with the formation of a metal dominated asteroid. We suggest that the hydration absorption could be a secondary feature caused by low-velocity collisions with hydrated asteroids, such as Cl or CM analogs, and subsequent implantation of the hydrated minerals into the upper regolith. There is recent evidence for this process on Vesta (Reddy, V. et al. [2012]. Icarus 221, 544-559; McCord, T.B. et al. [2012]. Nature 491, 83-86; Prettyman, T.H. et al. [2012]. Science 338, 242246; Denevi, B.W. et al. [2012]. Science 338, 246-249). Eleven members of our sample show bifurcated radar echoes at some rotation phases; eight of these are high radar albedo targets. One interpretation of a bifurcated echo is a contact binary, like 216 Kleopatra, and several of our sample are contact binary candidates. However, evidence for other targets indicates they are not contact binaries. Instead, we hypothesize that these asteroids may have large-scale variations in surface bulk density, i.e. isolated patches of metal-rich and silicate-rich regions at the near-surface, possibly the result of collisions between metal and silicate-rich asteroids.

The binary near-Earth Asteroid (175706) 1996 FG(3) - An observational constraint on its orbital evolution	ICARUS			English	Article						Asteroids, dynamics; Near-Earth objects; Photometry	PHYSICAL-CHARACTERIZATION; LIGHTCURVE INVERSION; OPTIMIZATION METHODS; TARGET; FG3; PHOTOMETRY; YARKOVSKY; RADIATION; OBJECTS; SHAPE	Using our photometric observations taken between April 1996 and January 2013 and other published data, we derived properties of the binary near-Earth Asteroid (175706) 1996 FG(3) including new measurements constraining evolution of the mutual orbit with potential consequences for the entire binary asteroid population. We also refined previously determined values of parameters of both components, making 1996 FG3 one of the most well understood binary asteroid systems. With our 17-year long dataset, we determined the orbital vector with a substantially greater accuracy than before and we also placed constraints on a stability of the orbit. Specifically, the ecliptic longitude and latitude of the orbital pole are 266 and -83 degrees, respectively, with the mean radius of the uncertainty area of 4 degrees, and the orbital period is 16.1508 +/- 0.0002 h (all quoted uncertainties correspond to 3 sigma). We looked for a quadratic drift of the mean anomaly of the satellite and obtained a value of 0.04 +/- 0.20 deg /yr(,)(2) i.e., consistent with zero. The drift is substantially lower than predicted by the pure binary YORP (BYORP) theory of McMahon and Scheeres (McMahon, J., Scheeres, D. [2010]. Icarus 209,494-509) and it is consistent with the tigidity and quality factor of mu Q = 1.3 x 10(7) Pa using the theory that assumes an elastic response of the asteroid material to the tidal forces. This very low value indicates that the primary of 1996 FG3 is a 'rubble pile', and it also calls for a re-thinking of the tidal energy dissipation in close asteroid binary systems.

J	Martens, HR; Ingersoll, AP; Ewald, SP; Helfenstein, P; Giese, B				Martens, Hilary R.; Ingersoll, Andrew P.; Ewald, Shawn P.; Helfenstein, Paul; Giese, Bernd			Spatial distribution of ice blocks on Enceladus and implications for their origin and emplacement	ICARUS			English	Article						Enceladus; Satellites, surfaces; Geological processes; Ices	GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY; CASSINI ISS; SOUTH-POLE; WATER; BOULDERS; SURFACE; HEAT; SIZE; ERUPTIONS; OVERTURN	We have mapped the locations of over 100,000 ice blocks across the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus, thus generating the first quantitative estimates of ice-block number density distribution in relation to major geological features. Ice blocks were manually identified and mapped from twenty of the highest resolution (4-25 m per pixel) Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) narrow-angle images using ArcGIS software. The 10-100 m-diameter positive-relief features are marginally visible at the resolution of the images, making ice-block identifications difficult but not impossible. Our preliminary results reveal that ice blocks in the southern hemisphere are systematically most concentrated within the geologically active South Polar Terrain (SPT) and exhibit peak concentrations within 20 km of the tiger-stripe fractures as well as close to the south pole. We find that ice blocks are concentrated just as heavily between tiger-stripe fractures as on the directly adjacent margins; although significant local fluctuations in ice-block number density do occur, we observe no clear pattern with respect to the tiger stripes or jet sources. We examine possible roles of several mechanisms for ice-block origin, emplacement, and evolution: impact cratering, ejection from fissures during cryovolcanic eruptions, tectonic disruption of lithospheric ice, mass wasting, seismic disturbance, and vapor condensation around icy fumeroles. We conclude that impact cratering as well as mass wasting, perhaps triggered by seismic events, cannot account for a majority of ice-block features within the inner SPT. The pervasiveness of fracturing at many size scales, the ubiquity of ice blocks in the inner SPT, as well as the occurrence of linear block arrangements that parallel through-cutting crack networks along the flanks of tiger stripes indicate that tectonic deformation is an important source of blocky-ice features in the SPT. Ejection during catastrophic cryovolcanic eruptions and condensation around surface vents, however, cannot be ruled out. Further, sublimation processes likely erode and disaggregate ice blocks from solid exposures of ice, especially near the warm tiger-stripe fractures. The relative paucity of blocks beyond the bounds of the SPT, particularly on stratigraphically old cratered terrains, may be explained in part by mantling of the surface by fine particulate ice grains that accumulate over time.

All of these identifications are associated with small dark paterae. We utilize NIMS data to quantify their volcanic thermal emission as similar to 0.53 x 10(12) W (or similar to 0.5% of Io's total heat flow). In addition, we refine our previous estimates of the thermal emission from 47 hot spots and highlight several hot spots within the Amirani flow field. Small dark paterae still out-number faint (close to the limit of detection) hot spots identified in high spatial resolution multi-wavelength NIMS data. In particular, we point out 24 small dark paterae that were scanned by NIMS (at resolutions down to similar to 17 km/pixel) but had no detectable volcanic thermal emission. All dark paterae are expected to have some volcanic thermal emission, but the small size and finite number of detectable faint sources limit their contribution to the total heat flow on Io. Compared to small paterae, small dark flows are more numerous but must have significantly lower surface temperatures. Finally, we update and summarize our results for the global heat flow on lo due to 242 recently active volcanic features including other dark paterae as well as large dark flows. The volcanic thermal emission from known hot spots, undetected (scanned) dark patera and outbursts can account for only similar to 56.2 x 10(12)W (or similar to 54%) of Io's total heat flow. Approximately 49 x 10(12)W (or similar to 46%) of la's heat flow remains an enigma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Prediction of transport and separation of binary gaseous mixtures based on the atomistic reactive force field	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE			English	Article						Process-based silicon-carbide membranes; Dual control volume method; Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation; Separation of gaseous mixture	SILICON-CARBIDE MEMBRANES; DYNAMICS SIMULATION; GAS-MIXTURES; OPTIMIZATION; DIFFUSION; NANOPORES; FLOW	The atomistic model of amorphous silicon carbide membrane that was developed in Parts l and II of this series is utilized in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study transport and separation of equimolar gaseous mixtures H-2/CO2 and H-2/CH4 in the membrane at high temperatures. We simulated membranes with up to about 39 fin in thickness, containing up to 170,000 atoms, and up to 100 on to obtain reliable statistics. The effect of parameters such as the temperature, the applied pressure drop across the system, and the membrane's thickness on the separation properties was studied. The trends in the dependence of the separation factor on the membrane's thickness are consistent with experiments, namely the separation factor increases with the thickness up to an optimal value, beyond which it remains constant, or may even decrease. The dependence of the computed separation factor on the membrane's thickness is used in conjunction with the experimental values of the separation factor to estimate the thickness of actual membranes. The results are in agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating the value of MD simulations with a reactive force field for characterizing the properties of complex amorphous films, and flow and transport therein.

J	Ramakrishnan, D				Ramakrishnan, Dinakar			A mild Tchebotarev theorem for GL(n)	JOURNAL OF NUMBER THEORY			English	Article						Rallis; Automorphic representation; Tchebotarev; Multiplicity one	STRONG MULTIPLICITY ONE; REPRESENTATIONS	It is well known that the Tchebotarev density theorem implies that an irreducible l-adic representation rho of the absolute Galois group of a number field K is determined (up to isomorphism) by the characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements at any set of primes of density 1. In this Note we make some progress on the automorphic side for GL(n) by showing that, for any cyclic extension K/k of number fields of prime degree p, a cuspidal automorphic representation pi of GL(n, A(K)) is determined up to twist equivalence, even up to isomorphism if p = 2, by the knowledge of its local components at the (density one) set S-K/k of primes of K of degree 1 over k. The proof uses the Luo-Rudnick-Sarnak bound, certain L-functions of positive type, Kummer theory, and automorphic descent along suitable nested sequences of cyclic p(2)-extensions.

Characterizing Snowpack and the Freeze-Thaw State of Underlying Soil via Assimilation of Multifrequency Passive/Active Microwave Data: A Case Study (NASA CLPX 2003)	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Active microwave data; data assimilation (DA); national aeronautics and space administration (NASA) Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) 2003; passive microwave data; snow water equivalent (SWE); soil freeze-thaw	QUASI-CRYSTALLINE APPROXIMATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SIR-C/X-SAR; WATER EQUIVALENT; GRAIN-SIZE; CORRELATION LENGTH; EMISSION MODEL; FROZEN SOIL; ROUGHNESS; MOISTURE	Ground-based passive microwave observations at 18.7- and 36.5-GHz frequencies and active microwave observations in L-[1.4 GHz] and Ku-[15.5 GHz] bands are used within an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to characterize the snow water equivalent (SWE) and the underlying soil freeze-thaw state (including soil surface temperature and both soil ice/liquid water content). The proposed framework is tested at the local-scale observation site of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cold Land Processes Experiment field campaign during the third intensive observation period (February 18-26, 2003) for which the best set of collocated ground-based passive/active microwave observations, SWE, soil surface temperature, and moisture measurements are available. The DA approach effectively merges an a priori estimate of the soil freeze-thaw state and SWE generated by a land surface model (LSM) with information contained in passive/active microwave observations in order to overcome errors in the forcing data of LSM. Results indicate that the root-mean-square errors of SWE, soil surface temperature, and soil ice+liquid water content after the assimilation of passive (active) observations respectively decrease to 25.4 mm (22.8 mm), 0.61 K (0.52 K), and 0.063 (0.057) from 90.55 mm, 2.17 K, and 0.13 before assimilation, resulting in improvements of 75% (77%), 72% (76%), and 51% (56%). Also, it is found that the simultaneous assimilation of passive and active measurements further improves the estimates of SWE and soil temperature as well as soil ice/liquid water content, suggesting that there is an advantage offered by the synergistic use of passive and active measurements. Overall, the findings show that future studies can take advantage of remotely sensed microwave passive and active measurements from present and upcoming satellites such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Soil Moisture Active Passive, and COld REgion Hydrology High-resolution Observatory (CoReH2O) for monitoring SWE and the underlying soil freeze-thaw state.

The RO payload will provide globally distributed vertical thermodynamic profiles of the atmosphere suitable to be assimilated into weather numerical prediction models. The Ground Segment services of the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and standard-RO processing services by University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (USA) will be available under best effort basis. Moreover, the mission will run, for the first time, a double-polarization GNSS RO experiment to assess the capabilities of polarimetric GNSS RO for sensing heavy rain events. This paper introduces the Radio-Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard PAZ and performs a theoretical analysis of the concept. The L-band GNSS polarimetric observables to be used during the experiment are presented, and their sensitivity to moderate to heavy precipitation events is evaluated. This study shows that intense rain events will induce polarimetric features above the detectability level.

Classification of Alaska Spring Thaw Characteristics Using Satellite L-Band Radar Remote Sensing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Alaska; freeze-thaw (FT); microwave scattering model; Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA); Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR); Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP)	NASA SCATTEROMETER NSCAT; FREEZE/THAW CYCLES; TAIGA FORESTS; IMAGING RADAR; ACTIVE LAYER; BOREAL; SNOW; FROZEN; SCATTERING; LANDSCAPE	Spatial and temporal variability in landscape freeze-thaw (FT) status at higher latitudes and elevations significantly impacts land surface water mobility and surface energy partitioning, with major consequences for regional climate, hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes. With the development of new-generation spaceborne remote sensing instruments, future L-band missions, including the NASA Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission, will provide new operational retrievals of landscape FT state dynamics at moderate (similar to 3 km) spatial resolution. We applied theoretical simulations of L-band radar backscatter using first-order radiative transfer models with two- and three-layer modeling schemes to develop a modified seasonal threshold algorithm (STA) and FT classification study over Alaska using 100-m-resolution satellite Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) observations. The backscatter threshold distinguishes between frozen and nonfrozen states, and it is used to classify the predominant frozen or thawed status of a grid cell. An Alaska FT map for April 2007 was generated from PALSAR (ScanSAR) observations and showed a regionally consistent but finer FT spatial pattern than an alternative surface air temperature-based classification derived from global reanalysis data. Validation of the STA-based FT classification against regional soil climate stations indicated approximately 80% and 75% spatial classification accuracy values in relation to respective station air temperature and soil temperature measurement-based FT estimates. An investigation of relative spatial scale effects on FT classification accuracy indicates that the relationship between grid cell size and classified frozen or thawed area follows a general logarithmic function.
