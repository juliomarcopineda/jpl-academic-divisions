S	Cheung, KM; Lee, C			IEEE	Cheung, Kar-Ming; Lee, Charles			A Trilateration Scheme for Relative Positioning	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				We introduce a trilateration scheme that evaluates the 3-dimensional (3-D) relative position between a reference spacecraft and a target spacecraft using raw-range measurements from a distance baseline of known locations, which we call "anchors". The anchors can be antennas of a ground-based network (e.g., Deep Space Network (DSN) or Near Earth Network (NEN) stations), or satellites of a space-based network (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) or tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS)). We define raw-range as the range that includes all the systematic errors that occur during range measurements. A unique feature of this approach is that accurate relative position is derived from a "differencing function" of raw-range measurements of the reference spacecraft and target spacecraft, thereby eliminating most of the systematic errors, such as media effects, ephemeris errors, instrument delays, clock bias, etc. There can be an arbitrary number of target spacecraft, and relative positioning of target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft can be done simultaneously. In this paper, we first assume an idealized system in which clocks on the reference and target spacecraft are synchronized, with clocks of the anchors synchronized as well. 2 We develop a novel iterative algorithm that computes the relative position of the target spacecraft with respect to the reference spacecraft. We illustrate the relative positioning method using the scenario of a network of three ground stations (i.e., the anchors) at Goldstone, California, USA, Madrid, Spain, and Marlargue, Argentina tracking two spacecraft at geosynchronous orbit distance. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges to sub-meter accuracy in estimating the relative position, in the presence of random errors and systematic errors in raw-range measurements, and in the presence of angular errors in estimating the pointing vectors between the anchors and the reference spacecraft. Next, we relax the requirement of perfect time synchronization between spacecraft, and show that by using an additional anchor, one can estimate and remove the clock biases between the reference and target spacecraft. We add a ground station at Kourou to the above example of three ground stations of Goldstone, Madrid, and Marlargue, and demonstrate that the updated algorithm also converges to meter-level accuracy (sub-meter in some cases) in the presence of clock biases in addition to the random errors, systematic errors, and angular errors as shown in the above case. We compare this scheme with a similar trilateration scheme for relative positioning scheme first proposed by Montenbruck in 2002.

S	Clark, I; Tanner, C			IEEE	Clark, Ian; Tanner, Christopher			A Historical Summary of the Design, Development, and Analysis of the Disk-Gap-Band Parachute	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Disk-Gap-Band (DGB) parachute was originally developed in the late 1960's by Clint Eckstrom for high-altitude meteorological rocket applications. It was designed as a balance between drag and stability with a relatively simplistic design and low packing volume. Due to its demonstrated high-altitude performance and design features, the DGB was selected as a candidate for Viking precursor test programs such as the Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP) and the Supersonic Planetary Entry Decelerator (SPED), in which the parachute was tested at high altitude supersonic conditions similar to those that would be experienced during an entry at Mars. The DGB was eventually selected for the Viking mission and qualified using a series of low-altitude drop tests and high-altitude balloon-launched decelerator tests (BLDT). Based on the success of the DGB on the Viking I and II missions, as well as the wealth of data generated during the PEPP, SPED, and BLDT test programs, the DGB parachute has been used on all subsequent U.S. missions to the surface of Mars with great success. Recently, an effort was undertaken to further improve the structural capability of the DGB parachutes used at Mars. An early activity was undertaken to better understand the breadth of designs, design modifications, and general evolution of the DGB canopy to better inform future designs. This paper collates historical DGB designs and structural performance. A key design shift includes the switch from low-tenacity Dacron skeletal components used in the Viking era to high-tenacity Kevlar skeletal components used in the Pathfinder era, which fundamentally changes the load sharing and energy absorption characteristics of the parachute. The paper also scrutinizes the analysis methods and flight limit load policies used throughout history. Of note is that the analysis methods have become "smarter,"transitioning from hand calculations to finite element analyses, but the use of more advanced methods have likely been eroding design conservatism leading to more aggressively designed parachute systems. Reflection upon previous DGB design and flight practices has shown that modern design practices may be driving large DGB designs outside the traditionally successful margin limits.

The magnetic circuit of the MaSMi-60 Hall thruster was modified to improve the magnetic field topology while increasing the strength of the field across the discharge channel gap. Direct thrust measurements were then taken to assess the changes to thruster efficiency, thrust, and specific impulse. The MaSMi-60's total efficiency increased by nearly 30% as a result of the improved magnetic field, resulting in a peak value of 32.1% (38.6% anode efficiency). Peak thrust and total specific impulse values of 35.8 mN and 1,440 s (1,550 s anode specific impulse) were observed. To demonstrate the thruster's enabling capabilities when paired with a smallsat-class spacecraft, three example mission trajectories to 118401 LINEAR, an icy asteroid-belt comet, were calculated. For each trajectory, the MaSMi-60' s experimentally demonstrated performance was used for the throttling table inputs. The trajectory solutions show a delivered mass fraction of between 35-49% for an initial spacecraft mass of up to 350 kg, a solar array power of up to 2.0 kW, and a total transfer time of similar to 6.5 years.

During the separation event, and subsequently during Schiaparelli's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), the NASA-provided Electra Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) payload onboard TGO was used to record signals from the Schiaparelli Lander for post-processing on the ground to recover both tracking of the lander's carrier signal and reconstruction of the lander's 8 kb/s telemetry. In addition, ESA's Mars Express orbiter recorded the Schiaparelli signal, with ground post-processing providing independent tracking of the lander carrier signal, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India was configured to provide real-time detection of the lander carrier signal. While an anomaly in the latter stages of EDL led to loss of the lander, these critical event data sets, and in particular the telemetry reconstruction enabled by the TGO Electra recording, proved essential in enabling detailed diagnosis of the anomaly. While the loss of the lander during EDL precluded the planned surface relay operations, the preparations for that activity provide important lessons learned for future Mars relay support scenarios.

The volume of propellants per unit mass of the payload required for that segment constrains the payload size and payload destination. To circumvent that limitation, this paper presents the feasibility of a refueling station using Lunar resources, called Lunarport. On Earth's moon, an unmanned station will robotically mine, produce, and store fuel and oxidizer from water ice at the poles. A first-stage-like rocket, called the Lunar Resupply Shuttle (LRS), stationed there and propelled with mined resources, will launch and dock with a passing payload-carrying rocket. That rocket will be reloaded with propellants by the LRS, after which the LRS will detach and the payload-carrying rocket will continue its journey to its desired trajectory. The LRS will wait in Lower Lunar Orbit (LLO, to avoid deterioration from Lunar regolith) until another payload-carrying rocket is launched from Earth, after which, the LRS will land back on the Moon, reload propellants, and launch again to dock with the next rocket. This paper elaborates on Lunarport, presenting proof-of-concept calculations of the increase in payload size sent to various payload destinations as well as a cost-benefit analysis. By way of example, NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) enroute to Mars that refuels at Lunarport can have a payload approximately 17 metric tons (mT) heavier than one traveling straight to Mars from Earth. This increase of more than 50% [1] is just to a relatively nearby planet-Mars. Sending a payload farther offers larger benefits with Lunarport. Wear-and-tear issues the port will be subjected to are also discussed. A full analysis of Lunarport will be done during the 2017 Caltech Space Challenge sponsored by Airbus Defence and Space held from March 26-31, 2017.

The Space Solar Power Initiative at Caltech is working towards turning this idea into reality, by developing the critical technologies necessary to make this an economically feasible solution. The proposed system comprises an array of ultralight, membrane-like deployable modules with high efficiency photovoltaics and microwave transmission antennas embedded in the structure. Each module is 60 m x 60 m in size and in the final configuration, similar to 2500 of these modules form a 3 km x 3 km array in a geosynchronous orbit. As the constellation orbits the Earth, the orientation and position of each module has to be changed so as to optimize the angle made by the photovoltaic surface with respect to the sun and by the antenna surface with respect to the receiving station on Earth. We derive the optimum orientation profile for the modules and find that modules with dual-sided RF transmission can provide 1.5 times more orbit-averaged power than modules with single-sided RF transmission. To carry out the corresponding orbital maneuvers, an optimization framework using the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations is developed to achieve the dual goal of maximizing the power delivered, while minimizing the propellant required to carry out the desired orbital maneuvers. Results are presented for a constellation with modules in fixed relative positions and also for a constellation where the modules execute circularized periodic relative motion in the HCW frame. We show that the use of these periodic relative orbits reduces the propellant consumption from similar to 150 kg to similar to 50 kg. This drastic reduction makes the propellant mass a significantly smaller fraction of the module's dry mass (370 kg), thereby solving a major technical hurdle in the realization of space-based solar power.

Specifically, location combinations are found in which at least one location in the set has access to sunlight throughout 99% of the year 2020. Locations are identified and evaluated using a process involving two illumination simulation and analysis methods and a set-cover algorithm. Results are presented that demonstrate the trade-off between number of locations and height above surface level to achieve near-continuous access to sunlight near Shackleton Crater. Identified near-continuous solar power solutions span from three locations 25 meters above surface level to single locations 775 meters above surface level.

Missions involving multiple spacecraft are inherently more complex to design than traditional single spacecraft missions. This is particularly true for fractionated mission concepts, where spacecraft have diverse roles and distributed responsibilities, and fulfilling mission goals requires communication and collaboration. In practice, this complexity and the lack of computational models and tools limit design teams to consider small design spaces and force them to quickly fixate on a single mission design. However, design fixation at such early stages often leads to sub-optimal designs. Towards overcoming this limitation, we propose an automated approach to exploring and visualizing the trade space of multi-spacecraft mission architectures that aids users in decision making, and provides a basis for identifying solutions that are Pareto-optimal with respect to user-defined science requirements, technical and resource constraints, and mission objectives. Central to our approach is the automated synthesis and analysis of mission architecture alternatives from a set of user-provided functional requirements and mission goals, as well as a library of spacecraft components and analysis models. Design rules (synthesis knowledge) are provided in the form of model-transformation rules. Sequences of endogenous model transformations are applied in-place to produce sets of candidate solutions, thereby effectively searching the design space. The search process is guided by the specified objectives, and is implemented using evolutionary algorithms. We demonstrate our approach to architectural optimization using a simplified radio interferometry mission design as a case study. We conclude that using the proposed approach, the number and diversity of candidate mission architectures available for consideration can be significantly increased. Furthermore, the automated synthesis and evaluation of mission architectures can lead to emergent and non-intuitive solutions to be discovered.	[Herzig, Sebastian J.

ASCoT is a web-based tool that provides a suite of estimation tools to support early lifecycle NASA Flight Software analysis. ASCoT employs advanced statistical methods such as Cluster Analysis to provide an analogy based estimate of software delivered lines of code and development effort, a regression based Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) model that estimates cost (dollars), and a COCOMO II based estimate. The ASCoT algorithms are designed to primarily work with system level inputs such as mission type (earth orbiter vs. planetary vs. rover), the number of instruments, and total mission cost. This allows the user to supply a minimal number of mission-level parameters which are better understood early in the life-cycle, rather than a large number of complex inputs.

The planned Europa mission would be equipped with a suite of instruments to perform both remote and in-situ sensing, the scope of which ranges from gravity science to characterizing the surface composition, with one of the objectives being to confirm the existence of the subsurface ocean. As the selected instruments mature, the challenge has been to select and refine a spacecraft configuration that is flexible enough to accommodate these changes without degrading the scientific capability of the spacecraft. An increase in instrument volume and power have prompted the growth of spacecraft engineering subsystems, which include the solar arrays and the avionics module. These changes have the potential to cause obstructions to the instrument fields of view, stray light keep-out-zones, and thermal radiative fields of view. Many of these criteria are addressed by the implementation of a dedicated instrument platform. Payloads that are unique to the Europa mission require new approaches to instrument accommodation, such as coupling the ice penetrating radar's radiating elements to the solar array. This paper will discuss these accommodation strategies for the Europa spacecraft to generate a new baseline design.

These will be demonstrated on currently funded missions, such as INSPIRE, MarCO, and Lunar Flashlight, which will be among the first CubeSat missions to leave Earth's orbit and explore deep space, Mars, and the Moon, respectively. Other concepts may consider using these technologies to explore Venus, asteroids, Europa, Titan, and other areas of the solar system. These missions and concepts can be enabled by the development of miniaturized yet performant command and data handling, power, software, and communications systems specifically designed for deep space applications. JPL is pushing the state of the art in small subsystems to augment NASA's history of exploration. While the CubeSat/SmallSat component market has grown significantly to benefit LEO applications, only a few vendors are actively developing avionics and instrument interface electronics capable of meeting the stringent environmental, reliability, and performance requirements of deep space missions. These electronics and systems need to be specifically designed to handle harsh radiation and thermal environments as well as extended mission durations, where a CubeSat may begin its science observations after a multi-year cruise. Deep space missions also require additional technologies, such as radio transponders for interplanetary navigation. This paper first summarizes the systems-level developments of the enabling technologies of the JPL avionics bus, looking at maturing hardware and as well as future evolutions of technologies. Second, the paper discusses potential science instruments and applications that could be accommodated by these unique flight systems, either within a CubeSat or SmallSat form factor. Finally, the paper pairs technologies and instruments and showcases potential science missions enabled by this novel capability.

The Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout mission, being developed by the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is implementing a solar sail on a 6U CubeSat platform to address a specific set of key strategic knowledge gaps laid out by NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD). NEA Scout's mission is to perform a close and slow encounter of a representative NEA as a robotic precursor for future human exploration. In addition to the resource limitations synonymous with small satellites, the NEA Scout flight system is further constrained by the implementation of the solar sail; for the CubeSat's expected 2.5-year mission, the solar sail is the flight system's primary attitude pointing constraint in order to achieve the trajectory needed to reach its target NEA. Due to the unique configuration challenges of fitting an 86 m(2) solar sail in the vehicle, NEA Scout's solar panels and medium gain antenna are fixed in a plane parallel to the sail. With the sail pointing constraint, the flight system cannot optimally orient the solar panels directly at the sun, subjecting them to a continuous cosine loss in generation. This may be the first deep space mission that has been designed to nominally not point at the sun - a challenge that traditional systems engineering and power models are not designed to handle optimally. To meet these challenges for NEA Scout and other similar mission concepts, JPL has created a novel flight system analysis model to rapidly simulate and iterate trajectories against spacecraft subsystem performance. Following mission design trajectory inputs, the model performs a Monte Carlo simulation of the flight system's performance. The outputs are distributions of the telecommunications downlink time (important for navigation and data sufficiency) and solar sail cruise angle (important for recharging the batteries before the next downlink). These distributions are processed and give key insight into the feasibility of the reference trajectory and likelihood of mission success.

A simple cold gas system is proposed to fill this need. A series of tests were conducted to investigate the dust suspension and entrainment phenomena under the influence of a cold gas jet in the near vacuum conditions at Mars. This paper describes the experimental set-up and results of these tests. Data was collected for more than 400 different tests in order to evaluate the influence of mass flow rate, molecular weight of the working gas, back pressure of the ambient gas, height of the nozzle above the surface, and the nozzle design. The results of these tests are summarized and presented. The test program showed that the use of a cold gas system is an effective means of clearing dust from the surface of samples and determined which design parameters are key for system performance.

The Effects of Constrained Electric Propulsion on Gravity Tractors for Planetary Defense	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Electric propulsion may play a crucial role in the implementation of the gravity tractor planetary defense technique. Gravity tractors were devised to take advantage of the mutual gravitational force between a spacecraft flying in formation with the target celestial body to slowly alter the celestial body's trajectory. No physical contact is necessary, which bypasses issues associated with surface contact such as landing, anchoring, or spin compensation. The gravity tractor maneuver can take several forms, from the originally proposed constant thrust in-line hover to the offset halo orbit. Both can be enhanced with the collection of mass at the asteroid. The form of the gravity tractor ultimately impacts the required thrust magnitude to maintain the formation, as well as constraints on the vectoring of the thrust direction. Solar electric propulsion systems provide an efficient mechanism for tugging the spacecraft-asteroid system due to their high specific impulse. Electric propulsion systems can generate thrust continuously at high efficiency, which is an ideal property for gravity tractors that may require years of operation to achieve the desired deflection because of the very low coupling force provided by the gravitational attraction. The performance and feasibility of the deflection are predicated on having the propulsion capability to maintain the gravity tractor. This paper describes the impacts of constraining the solar electric propulsion thrust magnitude and thrust vectoring capability. It is shown that uncertainty in asteroid density and size, when combined with the enforcement of the electric propulsion constraints, can preclude the feasibility of certain gravity tractor configurations. Additionally, odd thruster configurations are shown to drive the gimbal performance and to have major impacts on eroding incident spacecraft surfaces due to plume interaction. Center of gravity movement further exacerbates issues with gimbaling and plume interaction. A tighter plume divergence angle is therefore always desired, but this paper shows that there is an optimal momentum balance between plume interaction and asteroid-plume avoidance. Several gravity tractor techniques are compared based on metrics of time efficacy, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit time, and mass efficiency, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit mass of fuel. Given the propulsion constraints, halo orbits can be infeasible for smaller asteroids unless the mass of the spacecraft is augmented with collected material through a technique called the Enhanced Gravity Tractor. Another proposed method is to alter the halo period by canting the thrusters. In-line hover gravity tractors can always be moved along the net thrust direction to conform to the given propulsion system at the expense of performance, except in the case of smaller asteroids with propulsion systems that are limited in lower throttle range or maximum gimbal angle. Alternative strategies, such as on-off pulsing the thrusters to lower the effective thrust are considered. An example is described for deflecting asteroid 2008 EV5 (341843), which currently serves as the reference asteroid for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission.

These requirements are essential to communicating the constraints on the scope of the science investigations and clarifying how multiple instruments contribute to a given science goal. They also provide insight into how the science goals of the whole mission are affected by design choices. There is little specific guidance available on best practices for developing this science-driven flowdown. A unified Science Traceability Matrix (USTM) contains a significant amount of information that can be leveraged for that purpose, but the USTM was not designed to directly produce a complete science requirements flowdown. Thus, starting with the principles codified in a USTM, the authors propose a framework that directly maps into the requirements flowdown and supports broader systems engineering processes while retaining its meaning to the science team. This Science Traceability and Alignment Framework, or STAF, defines a set of common definitions and valid relationships to structure communication across the project. In addition, STAF populates a network of information that can be useful to support complex mission analysis activities such as fault protection. This work discusses the highest-level implementation of the STAF, the project-domain or P-STAF, which describes an approach to decomposing customer requirements into science requirements. The planned Europa Mission is used as a case study for the implementation of this framework and its potential benefits to a project.

However, they also pose a set of new environmental challenges that must be addressed in order to offer a viable alternative to ground-or space-based assets. In particular, maintaining science-quality pointing stability is a critical challenge for HAB platforms. For these missions, dynamic errors must be limited to a fraction of the observation wavelength, so as the wavelength becomes smaller, it becomes more difficult to meet the needed performance. As a result, there are very few existing pointing stabilization solutions that use visible-spectrum guide stars, despite their relatively wide distribution across the sky. This paper describes the results achieved with the STABLE (Subarcsecond Telescope And BaLloon Experiment) project whose goal is to provide the fine pointing stage for a balloonborne platform observing in the visible wavelength.

However, it is at a relatively low level of maturity compared to conventional propulsion options. Technology development efforts are currently underway to bring hybrid propulsion to a technology readiness level that would enable its infusion into potential Mars Sample Return. A new propellant combination is being considered for this design that has excellent low temperature behavior. Preliminary results of two ground test campaigns are currently underway to characterize this propellant combination. Hotfire testing is being carried out in parallel at Parabilis Space Technologies and Space Propulsion Group. In addition to the new propellant combination, several other technologies are being pursued for a potential hybrid MAV: hypergolic ignition and Liquid Injection Thrust Vector Control. Both of these technologies have been applied in other rocket applications, e.g. liquid propulsion commonly uses hypergolic propellants and missiles, such as the Minuteman II, have used LITVC in the past. Hypergolic ignition, when oxidizer and fuel combust upon contact, is highly desirable for multiple starts required by the MAV concept. Therefore, testing at Penn State and Purdue is being completed in this area. An updated hybrid propulsion system design for a Mars Ascent Vehicle concept based on JPL's current understanding of potential Mars Sample Return requirements will be presented, leveraging the advances in technology development as well as updated understanding of how requirements may evolve.

The GRACE-FO mission is the result of an international cooperation to develop a concept and approach that minimizes cost and risk and maximizes the probability of success through limited changes to the original GRACE system design. The result is a system architecture in which maintenance of heritage is paramount, including heritage derived through the partnership with the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in Germany. As a secondary goal, GRACE-FO will carry a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) as a technology demonstration, which will provide laser interferometry measurements of inter-satellite range, complementary to the K/Ka-Band microwave link to demonstrate laser-ranging technology in support of future GRACE- like missions. Another secondary objective is the continuation of GRACE radio occultation measurements.

Historically, international agreements provided guidelines to prevent contamination of the Moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the Earth (e.g., sample return missions). The UN Outer Space Treaty was established in 1967 and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) maintains a planetary protection policy complying with Article IX of this treaty. By avoiding forward contamination, the integrity of scientific exploration is preserved. Planetary Protection mission requirements are levied on missions to control contamination. These requirements are dependent on the science of the mission and on the celestial bodies encountered or targeted along the way. Consequently, categories are assigned to missions, and specific implementation plans are developed to meet the planetary protection requirements. NASA missions have evolved over time with increasingly more demanding scientific objectives and more complex flight systems to achieve those objectives and, thus, planetary protection methods and processes used for implementation have become much more intricate, complicated, and challenging. Here, we will portray the evolution of planetary protection implementation at JPL in several important areas throughout the course of NASA sponsored robotic Mars lander or rover missions, starting from Mars Pathfinder through the beginning of Mars 2020. Highlighted in the discussion will be process changes in planetary protection requirements development and flow down. Development and implementation of new and improved methods used in the reduction of spacecraft bioburden will be discussed as well as approaches and challenges that come along with setting up remote laboratories to perform bioassays. The consequences and forward planning of delays on missions will be highlighted as well as lessons learned on the impact of communication and training in achieving planetary protection requirements. The evolution of methods used for the detection of microbial bioburden on spacecraft hardware will be considered. These methods use standard microbiology as well as the adaptation of advances in biotechnology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Technical approaches developed for the prevention of contamination and recontamination of hardware during Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations will be discussed.

The FM system called MONSID is designed to provide off-nominal state detection and identification capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The analysis tool can be applied to MONSID models to predict MONSID's diagnostic performance for various sensor suite configurations and model topologies. The underlying algorithms of the diagnostic resolution analysis tool are discussed. The tool is applied to a MONSID model of a robot power subsystem to illustrate how MONSID's ability to distinguish among potentially faulty components is affected by the number of sensors and their placement (injection points) in the model. The tool can be utilized for FM design early in the program by supporting sensor suite selection. In the operations phase, it can be used to reduce the amount of onboard processing required by the MONSID engine in the fault identification process.

S	Lisano, ME; Kallemeyn, PH			IEEE	Lisano, Michael E., II; Kallemeyn, Pieter H., Jr.			Energy Management Operations for the InSight Solar-powered Mission at Mars	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				NASA's InSight Discovery mission to Mars will land its Phoenix-heritage spacecraft to the near-equatorial Elysium Planitia region of Mars in November 2018 - instead of its original planned landing in September 2016 - to collect science measurements over a period longer than one Mars year. Thus, instead of arriving in mid-Mars-global-dust-storm season in 2016 as originally planned, InSight now will arrive in 2018 during the Martian season when dust storms are typically waning. However, it must be able to withstand a global dust storm near the mission's end a Mars year later, by which point dust on the solar arrays is likely to have accumulated significantly more. This paper discusses how the change in launch date has changed the energy management challenges for InSight, and how the energy management approach for surface operations has been adapted to address those challenges. It also describes how energy balance and battery life are protected over the course of the InSight landed mission, in terms of a deliberate balance between autonomous on-board fault protection and ground commanding into reduced-load configurations that still make progress versus specific, prioritized mission success criteria. It describes the project's unique statistical analysis and usage of Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) archived data on solar energy collection to develop and validate an explicit pre-launch margin policy versus energy reductions due to environment variability over multiple-sol sequences. And finally, the paper explains how this archived energy data has influenced the modification of the Phoenix-heritage autonomous fault protection, to guard against quickly-arising inclement power-generation conditions, such as rapid onset of a local dust storm or water ice cloud front.

The starshade has a particular apodizing profile that effects strong suppression of starlight within the starshade's shadow. Since starshades that would be used in space are large, typically 30 m diameter or more, performance is difficult to test on the ground at realistic scales. This paper examines the practical limits for testing starshades at smaller scales in the atmosphere and goes on to describe concepts for testing starshades using ground based telescopes and using starshades for astronomical observations.

Instead of dedicated launches of large science instruments, small science satellites could be piggybacked as secondary payloads. After deployment, the SmallSats will rendezvous. Miniature robot arms will deploy and perform docking to a second SmallSat, similar to robotic docking on the ISS or space shuttle. This docking method accommodates uncertainty in GNC while reducing risk of spacecraft collision through increased separation distance. Docking will be repeated until the cluster is completely formed, amplifying their capabilities. These clusters would be scalable in both the number and size of the cluster elements. The formation will be maintained without expending energy or fuel. This work addresses technology development areas of creating large, scalable structures in space. This assembly method allows for very small packing volumes that reduces mass and cost. Increased separation distance between cluster elements provide larger aperture per SmallSat, reducing number of total elements. It also enables scalable large structures that can be reconfigurable. Precise relative repositioning can accommodate alignment errors or thermal drift in addition to enabling variable baseline instruments. Individual cluster elements could be grossly repositioned to provide hardware reconfiguration. Applications include large, scalable RF and optical apertures, interferometry, in-space assembly, close formation flying, scanning and fixed "stare" imagers, and mother-daughter spacecraft. Four aspects addressed in this paper include the robotic arm, end effector, SmallSat bus, and rendezvous. The robotic arm is designed to meet SmallSat size (< 0.5U), weight (< kg), actuation, and power (approximate to 15 W) (SWAP) constraints. The actuators can be driven using SmallSat processing and motor drivers. Manipulator position can be held without use of power. By maintaining these constraints, the miniature robotic arm can be used as a payload of a variety of science SmallSats. Accounting for general SmallSat bus trends, capabilities, and interfaces help to provide minimal integration efforts across different platforms. The compact end effector is designed to accommodate any positioning uncertainty and relative spacecraft motion during docking. After docking, the end effector remains engaged without the use of power. Docking can be released to allow for gross hardware reconfiguration. Modularity was another important aspect of the end effector design. While the focus of this work is on docking, modularity allows for a wide range of potential applications. A representative SmallSat bus was designed using COTS components. Finally, rendezvous and relative control of two SmallSats was investigated.

The best observations then available could not provide an acceptable upper limit of the dust environment, so a process was put into place to develop multiple contingency trajectories and attitude profiles that could be implemented within the last few weeks before closest approach. One part of that process was to quickly associate the range of potential dust environments with the probabilities that the spacecraft would survive the encounter. This paper provides an overview of the New Horizons Hazard Process and describes the details of the spacecraft hazard assessment. The New Horizons hazard assessment process began with images taken of the Pluto system using the high-resolution imager. Those images were passed to a group looking for new objects. The locations of any new moons were analyzed to develop the associated stable orbits. Using those orbits, a team of dust modelers developed a range of dust environments for the system using models of how the dust particles were generated by the moons and transported throughout the system. Other key assumptions included the optical properties that defined how the dust environments would be imaged by the spacecraft sensor. These environments were then coupled to the spacecraft trajectory and attitude profiles to predict how many hits the different spacecraft surfaces would see. The number of hits and the damage criteria for those surfaces were combined to develop the overall probability of survival of the spacecraft. There were two parts to the New Horizons hazard process that were unique and provide key features for how these types of studies could be improved in the future. The first part was the timing. All of the spacecraft operations were controlled by preloaded commanded sequences that needed to be developed, reviewed, and tested well beforehand. A set of alternate command sequences and trajectories were developed in advance of the encounter to respond to possible dust hazards in the event that significant hazards were found. The limits of the available imaging from the spacecraft meant that the process of final image acquisition, downlink, analysis, and hazard assessment had to be completed within a 3-day time period so that the appropriate trajectory and sequence could be selected in time. The unknowns associated with the dust environment led to the development of over 2000 dust model/trajectory/attitude combinations that had to be evaluated and assessed. As the number of cases to be evaluated increased, the processing time became the schedule driver. The second part was the parametric dust models used. In an encounter with an unknown dust environment, the calculation of the dust spatial distribution involves a range of parameters that need to be defined by the dust modelling experts. The relative likelihood of the different dust parameter sets used in the dust model allow the generation of confidence levels to be included with the overall spacecraft damage assessment.

The OS would be in Martian orbit where a sample capture orbiter could find it and rendezvous with it. The orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate it to a preferential orientation for the samples, transition it through steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle and providing a redundant containment to the OS (e.g., by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss component technologies developed for in-laboratory evaluation and maturation of concepts toward the robotic capture and manipulation of an Orbital Sample. We discuss techniques for simulating 0-g dynamics of a spherical OS, including contact, in a laboratory setting. In this, we leverage a 5dof gantry system and, alternately, a 6dof KUKA robotic arm to simulate the OS motion. Both the gantry and robotic arm are mounted with a force-torque sensor that enable detection of contact and provide measurements to simulate, in hardware, the 0-g OS dynamics. We present results that demonstrate the validity of our approach and the extent to which we are able to simulate 0-g dynamics in a laboratory setting. We also discuss techniques for detecting and tracking the OS using optical sensors and LIDAR from near-capture distances. These are discussed in the context of individual sensors as well as fusion of multiple sensor readings. Results of hardware experiments with different sensors are presented. Further, we discuss an uncertainty quantification based physics modeling capability for quantitative evaluation of different concepts for OS capture and manipulation. The computational models are based on high-fidelity multibody dynamics simulations of the OS, robotic elements and their contact mechanics. We present results that demonstrate our effective use of computational simulations in a complementary manner to hardware experiments. Finally, we present a cyber-physical approach to concurrently fusing hardware elements, computational simulation elements and autonomy software to effectively and rapidly simulate end-to-end systems concepts for end-to-end orbital sample capture and manipulation system concepts.

An orbiter would capture the OS, manipulate to a preferential orientation, transition it through the steps required to break-the-chain with Mars, stowing it in a containment vessel or an Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV) and providing redundant containment to the OS (for example by closing and sealing the lid of the EEV). In this paper, we discuss the trade-space of concepts generated for both the individual aspects of capture and manipulation of the OS, as well as concepts for the end-to-end system. Notably, we discuss concepts for OS capture, manipulation of the OS to orient it to a preferred configuration, and steps for transitioning the OS between different stages of manipulation, ultimately securing it in a containment vessel or Earth Entry Vehicle.

Long range mobility at an appropriately selected site on the surface and with the requisite science instruments will address these goals. The challenges for mobility are rugged terrain, unknown and potentially soft regolith, extremely low temperature, and on Europa, possible corrosive materials and exposure to radiation. We have designed and prototyped a concept vehicle that can handle a wide range of topography and terra-mechanics conditions that we believe is needed for successful roving on ocean world bodies. The concept has been analyzed, optimized, simulated, and designed. The results from operating and testing the prototype are reported in this paper.

These include: an order-of-magnitude or more increase in the area and consequent choices for accessing samples or making observations compared to past lander-based manipulator systems, the ability to deploy samplers and instruments over the extreme topography expected on ocean worlds, and accessing crevasses and vents from a safe distance. We have developed prototypes of concepts for long reach sampling and for deploying instruments and sampling systems on ocean worlds. In the paper, we describe a self-righting system to anchor and collect samples up to 20 cm below the surface and two options for sampler or instrument deployment at distances greater than 10m from a lander.

Development of Models for Disk-Gap-Band Parachutes Deployed Supersonically in the Wake of a Slender Body	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Advanced Supersonic Parachute Inflation Research and Experiments (ASPIRE) project will investigate the supersonic deployment, inflation, and aerodynamics of DiskGap- Band (DGB) parachutes in the wake of a slender body. The parachutes will be full-scale versions of the DGBs used by the Mars Science Laboratory in 2012 and planned for NASA's Mars 2020 project and will be delivered to targeted deployment conditions representative of flight at Mars by sounding rockets launched out of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. The parachutes will be tested in the wake of a slender payload whose diameter is approximately a sixth that of entry capsules used for Mars missions. Models of the deployment, inflation, and aerodynamic performance of the parachutes are necessary to design key aspects of the experiment, including: determining the expected loads and applicable margins on the parachute and payload; guiding sensor selection and placement; evaluating the vehicle trajectory for targeting, range safety, and recovery operations. In addition, knowledge of the differences in the behavior of the parachutes in the wake of slender and blunt bodies is required in order to interpret the results of the sounding rocket experiment and determine how they relate to expected performance behind blunt bodies at Mars. However, modeling the performance of a supersonic DGB in the wake of a slender body is challenging due to the scarcity of historical test data and modeling precedents. This paper describes the models of the aerodynamic performance of DGBs in supersonic slender-body wakes being developed for the ASPIRE sounding rocket test campaign. Development of these models is based on the four available flight tests of DGBs deployed in supersonic slender-body wakes as well as on data from past flight and wind-tunnel experiments of DGBs deployed in the wake of blunt bodies, on the reconstructed at-Mars DGB performance during past missions, and on computational fluid dynamics simulations. Simulations of the wakes of blunt and slender bodies in supersonic flow have been conducted in order to investigate the differences in the flowfields encountered by parachutes deployed in both wake types. The simulations have allowed the project to investigate the fundamental differences between the sounding rocket tests and the flight of a DGB during a Mars mission and to assess the limitations of the sounding rocket test architecture for evaluating flight performance at Mars.

On-orbit Measurement of ISS Vibrations during OPALS Extended Mission Operations	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Detailed understanding of the International Space Station vibration environment, particularly for the unpressurized portions of the platform, is and has been of high interest to payload developers seeking precision pointing performance due to its potential impact on on-orbit operations. The availability of such information, however, especially measured data, has been scarce, usually forcing investigators to utilize conservative bounding assumptions. During extended mission operations aboard the ISS at ELC 1, FRAM 8, the OPALS payload conducted a series of experiments aimed at improving the understanding of this key environmental parameter. The payload was repurposed for performing open-loop tracking of a ground-based laser beacon in a step-and-stare fashion so as to minimize the effects of its own gimbal on the measurement. Following significant processing of data acquired at 100Hz, the root-mean-square jitter at the OPALS mounting location is estimated to be in the 20-30 microradians range, and may even be in the low teens under certain conditions, an order of magnitude lower than previously assumed value.

The mission plans to extract a boulder from the asteroid's surface and use the combined mass of the spacecraft and boulder to slowly change the parent asteroid's orbit using a gravity tractor technique. ARM would then return this boulder to the Earth-Moon system for future human exploration. ARM would also mature several critical technologies needed for human missions to Mars including high power solar electric propulsion, dexterous robotics and autonomy, and support technologies for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. ARM has baselined two Microspine Tools for grasping, anchoring to, and helping extract the boulder from the asteroid. These tools must operate in the microgravity environment of the asteroid with the ability to grip and drill in microgravity. Another challenging constraint is the large uncertainty in the physical properties of the boulder. This paper describes the Microspine Tool's architecture, detailed design, and the fabrication and testing of a development unit. Three subsystems comprise the Microspine Tool: microspine gripper, anchoring drill, and the drivetrain, each of which expands the state of the art in space mechanisms.

The ability to rove on the surface of a comet could create a similar revolutionary improvement in the quality and quantity of in situ science that could be performed in comparison to touch-and-go systems or static landers. However, due to the microgravity environment, traditional wheeled rovers are infeasible as they lack the ground pressure on their wheels necessary for traction. Recent breakthroughs in limbed robots both at JPL and broadly across the world provide hope that a reliable and robust climbing rover could be a priority mission in the next decade. Similar rapid development has been occurring in anchoring end effectors that would serve as the rovers feet, preventing the rover from escaping the microscopic gravity field. When sampling the subsurface (1-3 meter depth), these same anchoring feet would also react the forces and torques that are put into the surface. A mission concept is presented that would analyze unaltered primitive materials, catalog complex organic molecules, and document any organic synthesis still occurring. In addition, the mission would quantify the heterogeneity of the comet's chemical and physical properties. A potential instrument suite is proposed that would fulfill these objectives. The science campaign of this mission was developed in partnership with JPL's Innovation Foundry.

A critical component of such a campaign would be an Orbiting Sample container (OS), which would contain the Mars samples to be returned to Earth. This paper discusses the most recent efforts by the JPL's Mars Formulation Office to mature an OS design planned for use on a potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. Similar to the "Decadal Study Architecture" [1], the current MSR architecture envisions as a three-mission campaign with each mission serving a critical role towards returning Martian rock and atmospheric samples back to Earth. An OS would be a central piece of hardware in the proposed MSR architecture due to its interfaces to all the three missions of the potential campaign. Additionally, numerous stakeholders and subsystems such as science and planetary protection impose challenging requirements on the OS's functions and capabilities. As a result, designing an OS that meets all the requirements is challenging and quite complex. The story of the OS's evolution from black box concept thru to the current-and-still-maturing baseline design is the focus of this paper. From the OS's launch off Earth aboard a Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) through to return to Earth, the design and functional requirements generated by and for each stage of the OS's mission are discussed. Then, with an understanding of what the OS would be required to do, a mapping of the main requirements to the design features of the current OS concept is explained. Many tests and analyses have been conducted to support and validate the current OS design. Results from test and analysis in the areas of aerothermal, impact dynamics, optical tracking, and radio electromagnetics are presented.

In particular, this paper is focused on aerostatic-based mechanisms, utilizing buoyancy principles to maintain flight. Three primary aerostat types were investigated; CharliSre (light-gas), Montgolfier (heated gas), and Vacuum aerostats. Supplemental systems to the aerostats were also investigated to assist with mobility control within the Jupiter atmosphere. The systems include the Balloon Guidance System (BGS) previously investigated for planetary balloons, and buoyancy controlled gliders. A CharliSre would provide the most reliable lift, however one needs to ensure 13 kg of H-2 for every 1 kg of payload. A Montgolfier would not require supplemental hydrogen; further analysis is needed to evaluate flight equilibrium dynamics. A BGS would provide the increased mobility otherwise unachievable with a conventional aerostat, offering steering ability (given wind gradients) between Jupiter belts and zones. Buoyancy controlled gliding is a potential solution which if executed correctly may bridge the functionality gap between traditional aerostats (with the benefits of reliable lift), and gliders (with maneuverability and navigational abilities).

This paper details the UST software defined radio design and describes how the combination of a modular hardware architecture and in-flight reprogrammability enables a new level of flexibility and expandability for a space transponder. The UST uses common power and digital processing assemblies that can be integrated with a variety of RF modules and is capable of simultaneous, multiband operations with data rates up to 37.5 Mbps RX and 300 Mbps TX. This allows a single radio to support all the direct-to-Earth and relay communication requirements for even complex mission scenarios, reducing the total cost, mass, and power. The discussion includes a description of the current UST engineering models that have been built and tested, as well as details about the next generation capabilities supported by UST, including advanced link coding and modulation, radiometric techniques, and in-radio protocol handling. Details are also presented on RF modules and digital processing in development for radio science and astronomy purposes, including a bistatic radar receiver and broadband planetary emissions receiver.

Charged dust is ever present, in the form of dusty plasma, even at high altitudes, following the solar illumination. If a body with high surface resistivity is exposed to the solar wind and solar radiation, sunexposed areas and shadowed areas become differentially charged. The E-Glider (Electrostatic Glider) is an enabling capability for operation at airless bodies, a solution applicable to many types of in-situ missions, which leverages the natural environment. This platform directly addresses the "All Access Mobility" Challenge, one of the NASA's Space Technology Grand Challenges. Exploration of comets, asteroids, moons and planetary bodies is limited by mobility on those bodies. The lack of an atmosphere, the low gravity levels, and the unknown surface soil properties pose a very difficult challenge for all forms of know locomotion at airless bodies. This EGlider levitates by extending thin, charged, appendages, which are also articulated to direct the levitation force in the most convenient direction for propulsion and maneuvering. The charging is maintained through continuous charge emission. It lands, wherever it is most convenient, by retracting the appendages or by firing a cold-gas thruster, or by deploying an anchor. Preliminary calculations indicate that a 1 kg mass can be electrostatically levitated in a microgravity field with a 2 m diameter electrostatically inflated ribbon structure at 19kV, hence the need for a "balloon-like" system. The wings could be made of very thin Au-coated Mylar film, which are electrostatically inflated, and would provide the lift due to electrostatic repulsion with the naturally charged asteroid surface. Since the E-glider would follow the Sun's illumination, the solar panels on the vehicle would constantly charge a battery. Further articulation at the root of the lateral strands or inflated membrane wings, would generate a component of lift depending on the articulation angle, hence a selective maneuvering capability which, to all effects, would lead to electrostatic (rather than aerodynamic) flight.

Additionally, dynamic systems offer the potential of producing generators with significantly reduced power degradation over the course of deep space missions so that more power would be available at the end of the mission, when it is needed most for both powering science instruments and transmitting the resulting data. The development of dynamic generators involves addressing technical issues not typically associated with traditional thermoelectric generators. Developing long-life, robust, and reliable dynamic conversion technology is challenging yet essential to building a suitable flight-ready generator. Considerations include working within existing hardware-handling infrastructure, where possible, so that development costs can be kept low, and integrating dynamic generators into spacecraft, which may be more complex than integration of static thermoelectric systems. Methods of interfacing to and controlling a dynamic generator must also be considered, and new potential failure modes must be taken into account. This paper will address some of the key issues of dynamic RPS design, development, and adaption.	[Qualls, A.

The WindBot would explore this region, which extends from 15km above to 125km below the reference surface at 1 bar. Proposed WindBot mission scenarios include a glider which would use updrafts to gain altitude before gliding to find another updraft, mimicking the action of soaring birds such as frigate birds. In another mission scenario, a balloon-like WindBot would use buoyancy to maintain altitude within its operational region. An important requirement of a WindBot is survival with energy obtained in-situ to provide power for the 30-50W avionic payload envisioned for the mission. The solar intensity below Jupiter's clouds is small and a solar solution as well as a nuclear solution have been ruled out from this study. This paper analyzes methods of energy generation and harvesting in Jupiters atmosphere and offers a comparison of the relative power densities. Wind, thermal, and magnetic energy, as well as other modalities, are sources of energy for a WindBot to transform into mechanical or electrical energy. Mechanisms evaluated include vibration harvesting and turbine technologies to utilize small-scale wind velocity gradients. Natural atmospheric thermal and pressure gradients may be tapped to provide power to a WindBot. The possibility of inductive generation using Jupiters strong magnetic field is also considered. Finally, these methods are evaluated on their power density and applicability to proposedWindBot designs.

An analysis of the optimum placement of two vertically collinear reflectors suggests that placement atop a 300m deployable support structure would be sufficient to provide year round illumination to points of interest in the crater below. In order to provide the 300W/m(2) of sunlight necessary for the robots to operate, each solar reflector must unfold to over 1000m(2) of reflective surface area, have over 95% long term directional reflectivity in the visible regime, and be flat within lmm/m of deviation. Each reflector must also stow to less than 1m(3) in volume, have less than 100kg of mass, and be less than 1mm thick. Two classes of origami crease patterns have been developed that will allow a 25 mu m thick aluminized biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate solar reflector with 95% visible reflectivity, to be stowed within a cylinder lm tall, lm in diameter, with a mass of 35kg, and with up to 0.71m(3) volume to spare in the center for other components. Each class of origami crease pattern can be deployed from their perimeter by an attached inflatable thermoplastic torus that heats up during deployment to maintain flexibility and cools to maintain rigidity afterward. The remainder of the 1m(3) volume will be allocated to the inflatable deployment mechanism, electronics, and the deployable support structure. In order to maintain flatness, carbon fiber fabric tapes would run along the load bearing paths opposite of the reflective surface. Simulations of an elliptic solar reflector under lunar gravity show that a single carbon fiber fabric tape 40cm wide that spans the length of the reflector is sufficient to maintain the required flatness. Future work includes simulating the deployment of the solar reflectors with their support structure, building and testing larger scale prototypes, and performing field tests in relevant environments.

By utilizing high temperature alloys, the rover would survive on the surface of Venus for weeks if not months. The rover concept harvests wind energy using a turbine and stores it in a constant force spring. The mobility system would be guided by a mechanical computer and logic system, programed to carry out the mission. It would collect basic science data such as wind speed, temperature, and seismic events. Communicating the data back to Earth is the most challenging aspect of the system design with multiple options being explored in a trade: a simple electronic high temperature transponder, a retroreflector target or inscribing phonograph style records to be launched via a balloon to a high altitude drone capable of transmitting the data back to Earth. AREE is not only a new exciting in-situ rover concept, but also a paradigm shift to conducting in-situ science in extreme environments. Traditional extreme environment vehicles collect as many diverse data points as possible in the short period of time before system failure. AREE breaks that trend by exploring what can be done with only a few basic scientific measurements, but recorded over long periods of time. In addition to Venus, the concept can be useful in other extreme environments in the solar system including Mercury, Jupiter's radiation belts, the interiors of gas giants, the mantle of the Earth and volcanoes throughout the solar system.

SpaceCubeX: A Framework for Evaluating Hybrid Multi-Core CPU/FPGA/DSP Architectures	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The SpaceCubeX project is motivated by the need for high performance, modular, and scalable on-board processing to help scientists answer critical 21st century questions about global climate change, air quality, ocean health, and ecosystem dynamics, while adding new capabilities such as low-latency data products for extreme event warnings. These goals translate into on-board processing throughput requirements that are on the order of 100-1,000x more than those of previous Earth Science missions for standard processing, compression, storage, and downlink operations. To study possible future architectures to achieve these performance requirements, the SpaceCubeX project provides an evolvable testbed and framework that enables a focused design space exploration of candidate hybrid CPU/FPGA/DSP processing architectures. The framework includes ArchGen, an architecture generator tool populated with candidate architecture components, performance models, and IP cores, that allows an end user to specify the type, number, and connectivity of a hybrid architecture. The framework requires minimal extensions to integrate new processors, such as the anticipated High Performance Spaceflight Computer (HPSC), reducing time to initiate benchmarking by months. To evaluate the framework, we leverage a wide suite of high performance embedded computing benchmarks and Earth science scenarios to ensure robust architecture characterization. We report on our projects Year 1 efforts and demonstrate the capabilities across four simulation testbed models, a baseline SpaceCube 2.0 system, a dual ARM A9 processor system, a hybrid quad ARM A53 and FPGA system, and a hybrid quad ARM A53 and DSP system.

The chronicle of designing and updating the Titan flyby altitudes have twists and turns enough to satisfy a full-length novel or feature film, including: critical design decision-making before arrival with multiple atmospheric models, high uncertainties, and limited data; early flybys that seemed to show trends that weren't there; use and misuse of statistical analysis; unexpected surprises with limited reaction time; navigation of a scientific, engineering, and management community with a wide array of inherent biases; and consideration of a variety of project risk postures in a high-scrutiny, high-impact, high-reward environment.

The designs are 4x4 in dimensions and fit within the surface area of one side of a CubeSat. Both arrays are dual-frequency and dual-polarization and are designed on different substrates. The frequencies of interest are 14 GHz and 35 GHz, and the polarizations are vertical and horizontal (or 0 degrees and 90 degrees). One array is designed solely on a Roger RO4003C material, while the other is designed on the RO4003C for the antennas layer and on an RT/Duroid 6010 for the feeding network. The designs are multi-layer and different challenges are being met. For integration purpose, the feed layers must be placed on the same substrates, which in turn require the elimination of any overlapping as well as increased spacing between adjacent lines. Symmetry for the feeds is ensured by using corporate feed networks as the array size (4x4) results in acceptable losses. Parametrization of the feed provided the flexibility to adjust element spacing and achieve a fully nested design where the 35 GHz array lies inside the empty space of a 2x2, 14 GHz sub-array. Also, adequate space for the integration of surface mounted amplifiers directly on the feed network layer is provided. The proposed array occupies only 8.7 cm x 7.2 cm and has similar radiation patterns at both frequencies and polarizations with an excellent front-to-back ratio.

Modeling Risk Perception for Mars Rover Supervisory Control: Before and After Wheel Damage	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The perception of risk can dramatically influence the human selection of semi-autonomous system control strategies, particularly in safety-critical systems like unmanned vehicle operation. Thus, the ability to understand the components of risk perception can be extremely valuable in developing either operational strategies or decision support technologies. To this end, this paper analyzes the differences in human supervisory control of Mars Science Laboratory rover operation before and after the discovery of wheel damage. This paper identifies four operational factors sensitive to risk perception changes including rover distance traveled, utilization frequency of the autonomous driving capability (AutoNav), terrain risk weighting, and changes in high-level mission planning. A resulting Rover Risk Perception Model illustrates how these operational factors relate to increased perception of risk. Based on these results, we propose aiding risk perception mitigation strategies such that risk can be appropriately anchored. Such strategies can include a change in system design including adding technology and decision support tools, or changing the training of operators who use the system.

This mission is conceived as a capabilities demonstration mission that would path-find high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) and Earth-independent human spaceflight operations for Mars missions in the 2030s, as part of NASA's Journey to Mars initiative. The high-power, light-weight solar arrays and high-power, magnetically-shielded hall thrusters being developed for ARRM will dramatically increase NASA's in-space transportation capability. These two technologies could propel affordable human missions to asteroids, Martian moons, and asteroids. In addition, these technologies could be used to enhance human access to cis-lunar space and the Lunar surface. This paper will provide an overview of ARRM and discuss how ARRM-developed technologies would feed forward to human deep space exploration missions.

These five orbits were designed to be as deep in the atmosphere as Cassini could safely fly; however, recent occultation data of Saturn's atmosphere suggest that it is contracting. Given this contraction, the primary concern during these orbits has shifted from spacecraft health and safety to loss of science value. This paper explores a scenario for modifying the Cassini spacecraft's trajectory, during these final orbits, such that it dips deeper into Saturn's atmosphere. This scenario describes the method for in-situ detection of Saturn's atmospheric state, the locations and sizes of maneuvers that would reduce the final periapsis altitudes, the effects of such maneuvers on the remaining trajectory, and the risks involved. The result is that a periapsis-lowering, "pop-down" maneuver is feasible during Cassini's final orbits. Risk to the spacecraft is minimized by using the attitude control thrusters as density detectors during the first three atmospheric transits of the final five orbits. Should these transits reveal sufficiently low density and should sufficient propellant remain, then the Cassini project will consider performing the maneuver.

The dynamic range, linearity, and sensitivity must be maintained at high frame rates, and artifacts must be minimized across large focal plane array (FPA) formats. In this contribution, we discuss the Teledyne CHROMA HgCdTe FPA in the context of imaging spectrometer applications. The FPA was characterized in a laboratory thermal-vacuum chamber that allowed the read noise, dark current, well capacity, linearity, and crosstalk to be measured. Results are presented across a range of operating temperatures and pixel clock rates. Additionally, the outcomes of radiation testing to 100 krad TID are discussed. The results of these characterizations are critical to the designs and performance predictions of future imaging spectrometers utilizing the HgCdTe CHROMA FPA.

The inversely twisted liquid crystal polymer (LCP) layer method was introduced to achieve broadband operation in patterned waveplate applications. The selection of the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength, and the precise control in fabrication to achieve these values are critical for high efficiency in these type of devices. We numerically simulated the conversion efficiency of inversely twisted LCP to determine the twist angle and half wave retardation wavelength for the designated wavelength range, and experimentally fine-tuned these parameters. The resulted VVW exhibit very high conversion efficiency in the designated wavelength range. Polarimetry measurement revealed that the retardation of the VVW is very close to half wave retardation in a broad wavelength range.

Minimizing Motor Cogging and Vibration for the Thirty Meter Telescope	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) needs to maintain precise positioning of the optical elements to deliver unprecedented image quality. Any vibration from observatory sources must therefore be minimized; model-based analysis leads to maximum allowable forces from any individual source typically of order a Newton or less in the most sensitive frequency band. Careful attention throughout the design process is needed to ensure that these challenging requirements are satisfied. We focus here in particular on cogging forces from the azimuth motor drive. Each motor yields periodic tangential and vertical forces of order 100's of Newtons, with higher harmonics of the waveform potentially exciting telescope structural resonances. There are 56 drive motors, and appropriate phasing between them can ideally cancel most of the net torque or net vertical force. However, the moment created between non-collocated forces still produces image motion even if the net force cancels, and further, small errors in forcer positioning result in imperfect cancellation. We provide a general methodology for estimating total cogging forces and then present an example of the expected TMT performance impact from motor cogging placed in context with the larger challenge of demanding vibration requirement.

The F-ring orbits, and proximal time outside of POST, were handled similar to Cassini's Solstice Mission using the Pre-Integrated Event (PIE) process. The new and unique properties of the spacecraft's trajectory required much forethought to be flown safely while still planning for the most and best science return possible. Some ring-plane crossings (RPX) will be protected against dust impacts by turning the high gain antenna (HGA) to the dust RAM direction (HGA2RAM). If on the first proximal RPX higher than expected dust readings are seen then the Project Office may choose to require more (all) subsequent RPX to be HGA2RAM, implemented via a real-time command overlay for uplinked sequences. The pointing uncertainties will be larger than usual after the final targeted flyby; some of the process changes to address this include adding extra orbit trim maneuvers (OTMs) (fuel permitting) to resync to the reference trajectory and reduce pointing uncertainties; and movable blocks of commands to be used for some periapses where atmospheric drag may cause large timing shifts Changes made for FRPO to address perceptions that these sequences will be hard to implement include requiring early pointing designs (during integration) for certain types of observations, requiring teams to check early on that they can turn to and from their observation attitude, and that their attitude is safe, and adjusting the Implementation process to give more time for science observation designers. This paper will discuss these process changes and lessons learned so far.

At JPL, we are designing a single receiver package designed to operate across the 8 to 48 GHz frequency range, in contrast to the current JVLA, which covers this frequency range with five receiver packages. Reducing the number of receiving systems required to cover the full frequency range would reduce operating costs. We are developing a prototype integrated feed-receiver package with a system noise temperature that meets the requirements of the ngVLA/NAA primary science programs, with a design that meets the requirement of low long-term operational costs.

S	Wilcox, B			IEEE	Wilcox, Brian			An Architecture for Sustainable Human Exploration of Mars Enabled by Water from the Lunar Poles	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes an architecture for human exploration of Mars that would be enabled by 10 metric tons (t) per day of ISRU water extracted at the lunar poles. The architecture involves a concept for a standardized "self-propelled tank" having an 85% propellant mass fraction that could hold up to 51 t of LH2/LO2 propellant. A variant of this tank would be equipped with landing legs so that, when fully-loaded, it could lift another full tank into Low Lunar Orbit (LLO), release it, and have enough propellant remaining to mate with an empty tank and to land safely back at the ISRU plant in a lunar polar crater. Two such pairs would be launched each lunar sidereal month such that the two payload tanks could mate together in LLO and depart to a carefully-selected High Earth Orbit (HEO). This orbit is such that exactly one tank would be consumed propelling one full tank to HEO and returning one empty tank from HEO to LLO, with both tanks arriving empty. Also, a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is selected where two full tanks in HEO could mate together such that one full tank arrives in LEO while the other tank has just enough propellant left to return to HEO, arriving empty. This combination of capabilities allows payloads to be launched from Earth into LEO, where they could be ferried to HEO using lunar propellant. Such payloads could be assembled together as stacks in HEO, where an array of full tanks accumulated over time from lunar ISRU could propel them on Hohmann transfers to Mars on every opportunity (every 26 months). The notional payload we envision launching to Mars every 26 months includes two 31 t Deep Space Habitats (DSHs, one for the outbound journey and one for the return journey) plus a 48 t Mars Surface Habitat with Ascent Vehicle (MSHAV). The stack departs HEO with a small burn from the array of 24 standardized propellant tanks - just enough to put it on an Oberth Maneuver trajectory, swinging by the top of the Earth's atmosphere where the main Trans-Mars Injection (TMI) burn occurs, consuming 7.8 of the 24 tanks. No tanks are jettisoned, so as to make this architecture sustainable and affordable. Upon arrival at Mars similar to 7-9 months later, another 9.2 tanks are burned to inject the stack into Low Mars Orbit (LMO). Exactly one tank is burned to de-orbit the MSHAV, reducing its velocity to zero at some point deep in the Mars atmosphere. The one tank that de-orbits the Mars entry stack is lost. After similar to 500 days on the Mars surface, the MAV launches and mates with the main stack in LMO. The returning DSH and the 23 tanks depart LMO with a burn of 4.3 tanks for Trans-Earth Injection. Upon arrival at Earth, 1.7 tanks are burned to inject into HEO, where the tanks could be shuttled back to the lunar surface for re-fueling. The DSH is mated with a single full tank at HEO that brings it to LEO to rendezvous with a crew capsule for re-entry.

A Deep Subsurface Ice Probe for Europa	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				This paper describes work on a concept for a probe that would be capable of km-scale deep subsurface ice penetration on Europa or other Ocean World. Penetrating deep into or through the ice cap over the liquid ocean is the best way to establish if life has evolved there. A central thesis of this work is that we must start by addressing the Planetary Protection constraints, and not to try to add them on at the end. Specifically, all hardware in the probe would be designed to survive heat sterilization at 500C for extended periods, as required to meet the COSPAR 1-in-10,000 probability per mission of biological contamination of the ocean. The baseline concept features a heat source containing plutonium-238 encased within a stainless Dewar so that the heat is not lost by conduction into the ice. A circular saw blade sticks out through a slot in a hemispherical turret dome at the bottom of the Dewar such that the blade cuts the ice as it spins. The turret also rotates slowly to cause the saw blade to make a hemispherical cut in the ice. The ice chips would be thrown up through the slit into the turret and would be melted by the heat source. The meltwater drains into sumps on either side of the sawblade, from which the meltwater would be pumped out to the rear of the probe. The main body of the probe contains a spool of aluminum tubing that would be dispensed from within the probe all the way back to the lander. This tubing is nominally 1-3 mm in outside dimension with integral insulated electrical wires around the center hole. This tube would pneumatically transport small (mm-scale) single-use canisters containing meltwater samples from the probe to the surface for analysis. Surface analysis allows use of instruments that can be neither miniaturized nor sterilized sufficiently to go down-hole. Dry inert gas would be used to push the canister down from the lander and back up. The dry gas would be re-compressed and re-used. During a portion of the cruise to the outer solar system, the heat source would heat the entire probe, including the coiled tubing inside as well as all the canisters and inert gas, to 500C to destroy any lingering organisms and to decompose any complex organic molecules. The paper describes analysis, design, and preliminary testing, as well as plans for building a prototype and testing it in an "ice treadmill" where a plug of ice is created inside a vertical LN2 cold jacket, pushed up by water pumped below so that the ice plug rises at the same rate that the probe penetrates the ice.

S	Xie, H; Divsalar, D; Farr, WH; Dolinar, S; Cheung, KM			IEEE	Xie, Hua; Divsalar, Dariush; Farr, William H.; Dolinar, Sam; Cheung, Kar-Ming			Very Low Rate Coded Laser Communications for Noise-Limited Space Optical Channels	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE			MODULATION	For an optical communications signal, when the noise power dominates, the capacity scales as the square of signal power over noise power. In this regime, data rate scales inversely as the 4th power of range, and the high data rate advantage of optical communications that results from a narrower transmit beam cannot be achieved. Before a received signal can be decoded, it first must be acquired from the background noise. In noise-limited optical communications, a background power dependent signal power threshold exists below which acquisition cannot occur, and data cannot be recovered. Decreasing the pulse width, corresponding to increasing the modulation bandwidth B, both increases capacity and aids acquisition. Higher modulation bandwidths than about 10 GHz require higher power in the control electronics due to the energy required to charge and discharge circuit capacitances. Higher complexity and higher power are negative attributes for space optical communications. One solution is to use a mode-locked laser, which enables very high effective peak power pulses with minimum complexity. A mode-locked laser utilizes a non-linear inter-cavity element to generate a fixed-rate train of narrow pulses. Communications requires data encoding on the fixed pulse train carrier. One method is to use a mode-locked laser with right or left circularly polarized output. Initial acquisition is aided by the narrow temporal spectrum and high peak power. Once acquired, all of the background noise outside the single data slot of the symbol can be rejected. In the noise-limited regime, capacity now is proportional to signal power over bandwidth-noise power product. The use of the mode-locked laser, versus a conventional pulse-carved continuous wave laser, allows optical communications links to be established in background noise regimes where the signal could not be acquired using conventional modulation schemes. This laser source and modulation scheme has benefits to CubeSat optical communications, and lander/rover Direct-toEarth communications. In this paper we investigate the design and performance evaluation of a coded mode-locked laser with right and left circular polarization switching. At the optical receiver a polarizing beam splitter and two photo-detectors are used to detect the data. One method for data detection is to compare the number of received photons from two photo-detectors. This comparison produces 0, or 1, or an erasure output. The erasure symbol is produced when the numbers of photons from the two detectors are equal. This method of detection produces an equivalent binary-input ternary-output discrete memoryless channel. Transition probabilities of this channel are computed based on received signal and background noise fluxes. We evaluate the performance of a very low-rate turbo code (rate 1/31) to be used over this channel. We compare this code's performance with the capacity of the underlying optical channel, and with uncoded system performance. We demonstrate that at least 10 dB coding gain can be achieved with respect to the uncoded case. Moreover, we show that the performance of this well designed code is within 1 dB of channel capacity for an information block size of 16384 bits.

Its rotary drill successfully penetrated the surface and pneumatically transferred material to the science instrument within the insulated interior of the spacecraft. Follow-on missions in the Venera and Vega program repeated that feat. These missions demonstrated that it is possible for an electric motor to function at Venus conditions and that it is possible to drill Venus surface material and pneumatically transfer captured sample under Venus conditions. Unfortunately, design details for the sampling system do not exist or cannot be located. Hence for any future Venus surface missions, the sampling technology has to be designed without any prior knowledge of materials or methods. To help advance Venus sampling technology, Honeybee Robotics in partnership with NASA JPL has been developing critical components that would make Venus sampling possible. To date, three types of motors (Switched Reluctance, Brushless DC, and Stepper), a Pulsed Injection Position Sensor (PIPS) for commutation and position control, and planetary gearboxes have been fabricated and tested at Venus Temperature and/or Venus Temperature and Pressure. This paper summarizes past work and presents the current state-of-art technology related to Venus sampling drill for the New Frontiers Venus lander proposal called In-situ Surface and Atmospheric Geochemical Explorer (VISAGE).

It is important to make sure such a mission concept would not bring any living microbes, which may possibly exist on Mars, back to Earth's environment. In order to ensure the isolation of Mars microbes from Earth's Atmosphere, a brazing sealing and sterilizing technique was proposed to break the Mars-to-Earth contamination path. Effectively, heating the brazing zone in high vacuum space and controlling the sample temperature for integrity are key challenges to the implementation of this technique. The break-the-chain procedures for container configurations, which are being considered, were simulated by multi-physics finite element models. Different heating methods including induction and resistive/radiation were evaluated. The temperature profiles of Martian samples in a proposed container structure were predicted. The results show that the sealing and sterilizing process can be controlled such that the samples temperature is maintained below the level that may cause damage, and that the brazing technique is a feasible approach to breaking the contamination path.

In order to ensure this does not happen, it would be necessary to "break the chain of contact (BTC)", where any material reaching Earth would have to be inside a container that is sealed with extremely high confidence. Therefore, it would be necessary to contain the acquired samples and destroy any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of their container while protecting the sample itself for further analysis. A novel synchronous separation, seaming, sealing and sterilization (S4) process for sample containerization and planetary protection has been conceived and demonstrated. A prototype double wall container with inner and outer shells and Earth clean interstitial space was used for this demonstration. In a potential future mission, the double wall container would be split into two halves and prepared on Earth, while the potential on-orbit execution would consist of inserting the sample into one of the halves and then mating to the other half and brazing. The use of brazing material that melts at temperatures higher than 500 degrees C would assure sterilization of the exposed areas since all carbon bonds are broken at this temperature. The process would be executed in two-steps, Step-1: the double wall container halves would be fabricated and brazed on Earth; and Step-2: the containerization and sterilization process would be executed on-orbit. To prevent potential jamming during the process of mating the two halves of the double wall container and the extraction of the brazed inner container, a cone-within-cone approach has been conceived and demonstrated. The results of this study will be described and discussed.

Compact piezoelectric resonance mass balance for sample verification and mass quantification and mixing	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 26-29, 2017	Portland, OR	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc, Fiberguide Ind, Frontiers Media		Piezoelectric; mass balance; resonance; flextensional; cantilever; ultrasonic mixing; portioning	RETURN MISSION; MODE	There is a need for sample verification and mass quantification of rock, soil and/or ice obtained by sample acquisition mechanisms on extraterrestrial bodies. For many scientific instruments information about the mass of the sample would aid in the interpretation of the data and help prevent the portioning system from overloading instrument ports. Additionally, on a potential sample return mission it is likely that a sample confirmation or mass determination requirement would be implemented before the spacecraft would be commanded to return to Earth or Lunar orbit. In an effort to meet these potential requirements, a piezoelectric resonance balance is being developed to measure a frequency change proportional to the sample mass change. In previous work(1) we developed a resonance balance which produced large non-linear frequency changes due to the addition of a large mass. In this study we have looked at a variety of resonator geometries in an effort to linearize the frequency shift with mass. In addition, we have investigated the use of oscillator/counter circuitry to track the frequency shift of the piezoelectric mass balance. In this new design the frequency shifts automatically when a mass is placed on the balance and the counter circuit calculates the frequency shift. This frequency is then converted to a mass using calibration tables determined previously. An additional feature we have implemented is the use of a high frequency thickness mode piezoelectric resonator to mix the sample and a reactant or solvent. This allows for measuring both sample and reagent prior to ingestion by the instrument. This paper will focus on the design requirements and how they are affected by the local gravity and acoustic properties of the sample. Designs which allow for easy loading and unloading of the balance will also be discussed.

We aim to give an efficient description of typical transition paths in the small temperature regime. We adopt a variational point of view and seek the best Gaussian approximation, with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence, of the non Gaussian distribution of the diffusion process. We interpret the mean of this Gaussian approximation as the "most likely path," and the covariance operator as a means to capture the typical fluctuations around this most likely path. We give an explicit expression for the Kullback Leibler divergence in terms of the mean and the covariance operator for a natural class of Gaussian approximations and show the existence of minimizers for the variational problem. Then the low temperature limit is studied via F-convergence of the associated variational problem. The limiting functional consists of two parts: The first part depends only on the mean and coincides with the F-limit of the rescaled Freidlin-Wentzell rate functional. The second part depends on both the mean and the covariance operator and is minimized if the dynamics are given by a time-inhomogenous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process found by linearization of the Langevin dynamics around the Freidlin-Wentzell minimizer.

J	Wesolek, P; Williams, J				Wesolek, Phillip; Williams, Jay			Chain conditions, elementary amenable groups, and descriptive set theory	GROUPS GEOMETRY AND DYNAMICS			English	Article						Chain conditions; elementary amenable groups; descriptive set theory; space of marked groups		We first consider three well-known chain conditions in the space of marked groups: the minimal condition on centralizers, the maximal condition on subgroups, and the maximal condition on normal subgroups. For each condition, we produce a characterization in terms of well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees. Using these characterizations, we demonstrate that the sets given by these conditions are co-analytic and not Borel in the space of marked groups. We then adapt our techniques to show elementary amenable marked groups may be characterized by well-founded descriptive-set-theoretic trees, and therefore, elementary amenability is equivalent to a chain condition. Our characterization again implies the set of elementary amenable groups is co-analytic and non-Borel. As corollary, we obtain a new, non-constructive, proof of the existence of finitely generated amenable groups that are not elementary amenable.

Modeling of a space-based 2 mu m, high pulse energy, triple-pulse, direct detection integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar was conducted to demonstrate CO2 measurement capability and to evaluate random and systematic errors. Parameters based on recent technology developments in the 2 mu m laser and state-of-the-art HgCdTe (MCT) electron-initiated avalanche photodiode (e-APD) detection system were incorporated in this model. Strong absorption features of CO2 in the 2 mu m region, which allows optimum lower tropospheric and near surface measurements, were used to project simultaneous measurements using two independent altitude-dependent weighting functions with the triple-pulse IPDA. Analysis of measurements over a variety of atmospheric and aerosol models using a variety of Earth's surface target and aerosol loading conditions were conducted. Water vapor (H2O) influences on CO2 measurements were assessed, including molecular interference, dry-air estimate, and line broadening. Projected performance shows a < 0.35 ppm precision and a < 0.3 ppm bias in low-tropospheric weighted measurements related to column CO2 optical depth for the space-based IPDA using 10 s signal averaging over the Railroad Valley (RRV) reference surface under clear and thin cloud conditions.

The EPS elements are presented and their features described by their key parameters. These components are inclusive of the body-mounted Solar Array Panels for Power Generation, the Power Control Unit (PCU) and Power Distribution Unit (PDU), a Li-Ion Battery and the Thermal Control System's Heater Control Electronics (HCE's) acting as active current control front-ends. The latter is explained more in detail with respect to its purpose and implementation. The GRACE-FO EPS has been given the designation of "quiet" EPS due to the function of the HCE within the thermal control Subsystem. The final portion of the paper provides information about the power and energy budgeting and operational aspects of the EPS such as undervoltage and overcurrent H/W features of the PCU/PDU design, and the EPS related On-board Software and On-Board Control Procedures. Finally, the system level power analysis is provided to provide the reader with a better understanding of the expected behaviour of the electrical power parameters.

However, there are two expected populations of high energy neutrinos: the astrophysical flux observed by IceCube (similar to 1 PeV) and the cosmogenic flux (similar to 10(17) eV or 100 PeV). Typical radio arrays employ a noise-riding trigger, which limits their minimum energy threshold based on the background noise temperature of the ice. Phased radio arrays could lower the energy threshold by combining the signals from several channels before triggering, thereby improving the signal-to-noise at the trigger level. Reducing the energy threshold would allow radio experiments to more e ffi ciently overlap with optical Cherenkov neutrino telescopes as well as for more e ffi cient searches for cosmogenic neutrinos. We discuss the proposed technique and prototypical phased arrays deployed in an anechoic chamber and at Greenland's Summit Station.

A comprehensive methodology for discovering semantic relationships among geospatial vocabularies using oceanographic data discovery as an example	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Query augmentation; semantic search; web mining; search history; click behavior; big data	BIG DATA; SIMILARITY; SEARCH	It is challenging to find relevant data for research and development purposes in the geospatial big data era. One long-standing problem in data discovery is locating, assimilating and utilizing the semantic context for a given query. Most research in the geospatial domain has approached this problem in one of two ways: building a domain-specific ontology manually or discovering automatically, semantic relationships using metadata and machine learning techniques. The former relies on rich expert knowledge but is static, costly and labor intensive, whereas the second is automatic and prone to noise. An emerging trend in information science takes advantage of large-scale user search histories, which are dynamic but subject to user-and crawler-generated noise. Leveraging the benefits of these three approaches and avoiding their weaknesses, a novel methodology is proposed to (1) discover vocabulary-based semantic relationships from user search histories and clickstreams, (2) refine the similarity calculation methods from existing ontologies and (3) integrate the results of ontology, metadata, user search history and clickstream analysis to better determine their semantic relationships. An accuracy assessment by domain experts for the similarity values indicates an 83% overall accuracy for the top 10 related terms over randomly selected sample queries. This research functions as an example for building vocabulary-based semantic relationships for different geographical domains to improve various aspects of data discovery, including the accuracy of the vocabulary relationships of commonly used search terms.

Theological investigation can help meet significant research goals in artificial intelligence by orienting the development of agent communication and moral reasoning toward a shared moral and spiritual development of human persons and intelligent agents. In particular, Josiah Royce's Loyalty-to-Loyalty initiates a moral stance within which humans and intelligent agents can develop constructive ethical frameworks and his semiotic philosophy of community can guide the development and functioning of an agent's interpretive processes and can model shared spiritual formation.

In order to achieve these efficiencies, two-dimensional doping methods are used to increase the UV sensitivity of back-illuminated Si sensors. Integrated filters are then deposited by a combination of Al evaporation and atomic layer deposition of dielectric spacer layers. At far UV wavelengths these filters require the use of non-absorbing dielectrics, and we have pursued the development of new atomic layer deposition processes for metal fluorides materials of MgF2, AlF3 and LiF. The performance of the complete multilayer filters on Si photodiodes and CCD imaging sensors, and the design and fabrication challenges associated with this development are demonstrated. This includes the continued development of deep diffused silicon avalanche photodiodes designed to detect the fast 220 nm emission component of barium fluoride scintillation crystals, while optically rejecting a slower component at 300 nm.

However, to date, the sample thicknesses used in wavefront shaping experiments have been limited to only a few millimeters or several transport mean free paths. Here, by using a long-coherence-length laser and an optimized digital OPC system that efficiently delivers light power, we focused 532 nm light through tissue-mimicking phantoms up to 9.6 cm thick, as well as through ex vivo chicken breast tissue up to 2.5 cm thick.

The mission's primary objectives will be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. This single spacecraft solution with an L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar has a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed, uses a reflector-feed system whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive ("SweepSAR") capability at both L-band and S-band. This design is in contrast to recent concepts towards large constellations of smaller radar satellites, and is driven by the science requirements for complete coverage over the 12-day repeat cycle, using repeat pass interferometry and polarimetry to measure deformation and surface properties. A single spacecraft with enough aperture, power, duty cycle, and downlink capacity was determined to be a more practical and implementable solution that multiple smaller spacecraft. The use of a single large aperture reflector for both the L- and S-band radars enables both to have comparable performance, leading to overall development and operational efficiencies.

The current software architecture used to process this data is the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), a powerful and modular platform that applies a combination of novel and legacy processing modules to many sources of SAR data. Until recently, this architecture could process most images in a reasonable amount of time; however in the case of the NISAR mission (where the daily influx as well as the size of the images themselves are significantly larger) the current architecture can take hours to process even a single image. This paper explores new efforts to use a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to accelerate one of the processing modules to achieve unprecedented runtimes with no loss in precision, potentially setting a new standard in radar processing in the world of "Big Data".

Longer wavelengths (S-Band and L-Band) are preferred because they do not decorrelate as quickly as shorter wavelengths. Rapid revisit (1-3 days) is preferred because it allows the study of these phenomena at the timescales at which they commonly occur. Global access on such timescales is also required. Vector surface deformation measurements, taken from more than one direction, are a desired feature. This paper describes the conceptual architecture of a longer wavelength, Smallsat SAR constellation of up to 12 satellites for rapid revisit surface deformation studies. The key to making such a constellation affordable is to lower launch costs, spacecraft costs, and instrument (SAR) costs. The first two objectives can be achieved using an ESPA-ring class, or Smallsat, spacecraft. The third objective requires a SAR instrument sized to fit the mass and volume constraints imposed by such a spacecraft. Current state-of-the-art in miniaturization of electronics means that the radar transmit, receive and data handling functions can easily be implemented in a compact, low mass solution. The most significant challenge in designing a SAR to fit the Smallsat paradigm is in the dimensions of the antenna. The antenna sizing problem is addressed by adopting a smaller antenna than allowed by conventional SAR design rules. The baseline antenna design is simple, requiring no electronic beam-steering or beam-forming capability. Both reflectarray and microstrip patch antenna solutions are considered. The antenna structure is dual-purpose, to limit the overall system mass, with solar panels on the backplane providing power for the radar and spacecraft. The proposed solution easily accommodates radar squint angles of +/- 30 degrees for repeat-pass interferometry measurements from multiple directions.

The resulting ionospheric distortion can be represented as attenuation and bulk delay, in addition to higher-order frequency dispersion effects. Baseline, uncorrected images are often unusable when the solar zenith angle is less than 90 degrees (day side). In this work, a radar autofocus algorithm is developed that estimates and inverts ionospheric distortion, producing a focused radargram of the ice deposit subsurface. A maximum likelihood approach is developed that incorporates simulated surface clutter returns for the current spacecraft position, based on the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) elevation model of the Martian surface. An ancillary product is a surface-only clutter simulation for each orbit, which is necessary to identify true subsurface features.

Beyond the potential for earthquake-induced failure, performance monitoring of the levee system on the network level and the assessment of potential distress levels are needed for the maintenance and rehabilitation of this system. In this case, critical deformation needs to be assessed especially in view of the levees age, sea level rise, and ongoing subsidence due to the decomposition of the peat foundation layer. The work presented herein describes the remote sensing of a levee section deformation with time. The levee section is located on Sherman Island, CA and monitoring was conducted in situ by GPS, in addition to remote sensing by airborne synthetic aperture radar and satellite systems. Coupled deformation/seepage numerical analysis of the levee section is performed using PLAXIS. The numerical model included characterization of the unsaturated-saturated zones and the peat foundation layer. Key parameters of the peat layer were synthesized from published data to provide baseline assessment for the current condition of the levee system in view of the measured rate of deformation.

For this objective, the authors initially developed methods and obtained preliminary test results based on the use of ultrasonic pulse-echo transducers and enhanced signal-processing tool; however, the methodology needed further development in order to obtain measurements in turbulent dynamic flow conditions. To improve the reliability of measurements taken in turbulent flow conditions, an experimental system was developed using multiple transducers driven by a multiplexer, and a data acquisition module capable of operating in any flow conditions. The system consists of a simulation testbed, which allows testing the performance over a range of flow rates and water levels and to observe flow conditions and patterns, as well as measure actual water level, flow velocities, wave conditions, etc. In this paper, we present the development details that include description of the testbed for simulating the flow of condensed water, the multiple transducers arrangement, the signal processing method, and the test results of both steady state and turbulent flow.

In this work, we report quantitative photoacoustic elastography (QPAE), capable of measuring Young's modulus of human tissue in vivo. By combining photoacoustic elastography with a stress sensor having known stress-strain behavior, QPAE can simultaneously measure strain and stress, from which Young's modulus is calculated. We first applied QPAE to quantify the Young's modulus of tissue-mimicking agar phantoms with different concentrations. The measured values fitted well with both the empirical expectations based on the agar concentrations and those measured in independent standard compression tests. We then demonstrated the feasibility of QPAE by measuring the Young's modulus of human skeletal muscle in vivo. The data showed a linear relationship between muscle stiffness and loading. The results proved that QPAE can noninvasively quantify the absolute elasticity of biological tissue, thus enabling longitudinal imaging of tissue elasticity. QPAE can be exploited for both preclinical biomechanics studies and clinical applications.

Linear-array-based photoacoustic tomography for label-free high-throughput detection and quantification of circulating melanoma tumor cell clusters	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		photoacoustic tomography; cancer metastasis; circulating tumor cell; cancer therapy	IN-VIVO; CANCER METASTASIS; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; MICROSCOPY; RESOLUTION; CAPTURE; SYSTEM	Circulating tumor cell (CTC) clusters arise from multicellular grouping in the primary tumor and elevate the metastatic potential by 23 to 50 fold compared to single CTCs. High throughout detection and quantification of CTC clusters is critical for understanding the tumor metastasis process and improving cancer therapy. In this work, we report a lineararray- based photoacoustic tomography (LA-PAT) system capable of label-free high-throughput CTC cluster detection and quantification in vivo. LA-PAT detects CTC clusters and quantifies the number of cells in them based on the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of photoacoustic signals. The feasibility of LA-PAT was first demonstrated by imaging CTC clusters ex vivo. LA-PAT detected CTC clusters in the blood-filled microtubes and computed the number of cells in the clusters. The size distribution of the CTC clusters measured by LA-PAT agreed well with that obtained by optical microscopy. We demonstrated the ability of LA-PAT to detect and quantify CTC clusters in vivo by imaging injected CTC clusters in rat tail veins. LA-PAT detected CTC clusters immediately after injection as well as when they were circulating in the rat bloodstreams. Similarly, the numbers of cells in the clusters were computed based on the CNRs of the photoacoustic signals. The data showed that larger CTC clusters disappear faster than the smaller ones. The results prove the potential of LA-PAT as a promising tool for both preclinical tumor metastasis studies and clinical cancer therapy evaluation.

Real-time photoacoustic flow cytography and photothermolysis of single circulating melanoma cells in vivo	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Photoacoustic microscopy; flow cytography; circulating tumor cell; melanoma; laser therapy	TUMOR-CELLS; CHALLENGES	Metastasis is responsible for as many as 90% of cancer-related deaths, and the deadliest skin cancer, melanoma, has a high propensity for metastasis. Since hematogenous spread of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is cancer's main route of metastasis, detecting and destroying CTCs can impede metastasis and improve patients' prognoses. Extensive studies employing exogenous agents to detect tumor-specific biomarkers and guide therapeutics to CTCs have achieved promising results, but biosafety remains a critical concern. Taking another approach, physical detection and destruction of CTCs is a safer way to evaluate and reduce metastasis risks. Melanoma cells strongly express melanosomes, providing a striking absorption contrast with the blood background in the red to near-infrared spectrum. Exploiting this intrinsic optical absorption contrast of circulating melanoma cells, we coupled dual-wavelength photoacoustic flow cytography with a nanosecond-pulsed laser killing mechanism that specifically targets melanoma CTCs. We have successfully achieved in vivo label-free imaging of rare single CTCs and CTC clusters in mice. Further, the photoacoustic signal from a CTC immediately hardware-triggers a lethal pinpoint laser irradiation that lyses it on the spot in a thermally confined manner. Our technology can facilitate early inhibition of metastasis by clearing circulating tumor cells from vasculature.

Imaging Small-animal Whole-body Dynamics by Single-impulse Panoramic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography	PHOTONS PLUS ULTRASOUND: IMAGING AND SENSING 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Photons Plus Ultrasound - Imaging and Sensing	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, SENO Med Instruments Inc		Single-impulse; whole-body imaging; small-animal imaging; photoacoustic computed tomography	MULTISPECTRAL OPTOACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY; MICROSCOPY	Small animal whole-body imaging, providing physiological, pathological, and phenotypical insights into biological processes, is indispensable in preclinical research. With high spatiotemporal resolution and functional contrast, small animal imaging can visualize biological dynamics in vivo at whole-body scale, which can advance both fundamental biology and translational medicine. However, current non-optical imaging techniques lack either spatiotemporal resolution or functional contrasts, and pure optical imaging suffers from either shallow penetration (up to similar to 1 mm) or a poor resolution-to-depth ratio (similar to 1/ 3). Here, we present a standalone system, termed single-impulse panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography (SIP-PACT), which overcomes all the above limitations. Our technology, with unprecedented performance, is envisioned to complement existing modalities for imaging entire small animals. As an optical imaging modality, SIP-PACT captures the high molecular contrast of endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, melanin, and lipid, as well as exogenous biomarkers, at the whole animal scale with full-view fidelity. Unlike other optical imaging methods, SIP-PACT sees through similar to 5 cm of tissue in vivo, and acquires cross-sectional images with an in-plane resolution of similar to 100 mu m. Such capabilities allow us to image, for the first time, mouse wholebody dynamics in real time with clear sub-organ anatomical and functional details and without motion artifacts. SIPPACT can capture transients of whole-body oxygen saturation and pulse wave propagation in vivo without labeling. In sum, we expect widespread applications of SIP-PACT as a whole-body imaging tool for small animals in fundamental biology, pharmacology, pathology, oncology, and other areas.

QPI is often performed by optical interferometry, where two coherent beams of light are used to produce interference patterns at a detector plane. Many algorithms exist to calculate the phase of the incident light from these recorded interference patterns as well as enhance their quality by various de-noising methods. Many of these de-noising algorithms, however, corrupt the quantitative aspect of the measurement, resulting in phase contrast images. Among these phase calculation techniques and de-noising algorithms, none approach the optimization of phase measurements by theoretically addressing the various sources of error in its measurement, as well as how these errors propagate to the phase calculations. In this work, we investigate the various sources of error in the measurements required for QPI, as well as theoretically derive the influence of each source of error on the overall phase calculation for three common phase calculation techniques: the four bucket/step method, three bucket/step method, and the Carre method. The noise characteristics of each of these techniques are discussed and compared using error parameters of a readily available CCD sensor array. Additionally, experimental analysis is conducted on interferograms to investigate the influence of speckle noise on the phase measurements of the three algorithms discussed.

We observed WASP-103b during secondary eclipse using two visits of the Hubble Space Telescope with the G141 grism on Wide Field Camera 3 in spatial scan mode. We generated secondary eclipse light curves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned wavechannels from 1.1 to 1.7 mu m and corrected the light curves for flux contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope toward the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of T-B = 2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically isothermal system, i. e., pseudo-isothermal. A solar-metallicity profile with a thermal inversion layer at 10(-2) bar fits the spectrum of WASP-103b with high confidence, as do an isothermal profile with solar metallicity and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O > 1. The data rule out a monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with solar composition, and we rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as unphysical for this system. The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the upper atmosphere. Transmission spectra at optical wavelengths would allow us to better distinguish between potential atmospheric models.	[Cartier, Kimberly M.

Researchers use them to establish the extragalactic distance scale, to underpin estimates of the Hubble constant, and to study peculiar velocities induced by gravitational attractions that perturb the motions of galaxies with respect to the "Hubble flow" of universal expansion. In 2006 the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) began making available a comprehensive compilation of redshift-independent extragalactic distance estimates. A decade later, this compendium of distances (NED-D) now contains more than 100,000 individual estimates based on primary and secondary indicators, available for more than 28,000 galaxies, and compiled from over 2000 references in the refereed astronomical literature. This paper describes the methodology, content, and use of NED-D, and addresses challenges to be overcome in compiling such distances. Currently, 75 different distance indicators are in use. We include a figure that facilitates comparison of the indicators with significant numbers of estimates in terms of the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum distances spanned. Brief descriptions of the indicators, including examples of their use in the database, are given in an appendix.

The fluxes of species and heat are written in the framework of fluctuation-dissipation theory and include Soret and Dufour effects. For more than two species, the full mass diffusion and thermal diffusion matrices are computed using high-pressure mixing rules which utilize as building blocks the corresponding binary diffusion coefficients. The mixture viscosity and thermal conductivity are computed using standard mixing rules and corresponding states theory. To evaluate the physical model and numerical method, LES is employed first to simulate a supercritical N-2 jet injected into N-2. Time averaged results show reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Then, DNS is conducted to study the spatial evolution of a supercritical N-2 jet injected into CO2. Time averaged results are used to compute the length of the potential core and the species diffusion characteristics. Spectral analysis is then applied on a time series data obtained at several axial locations and a dominant frequency is observed inside the potential core.

A Comparative Study of Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities in 2D and 3D in Tantalum	SHOCK COMPRESSION OF CONDENSED MATTER - 2015	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Biennial American-Physical-Society (APS) Conference on Shock Compression of Condensed Matter (SCCM)	JUN 14-19, 2015	Tampa, FL	Amer Phys Soc, DTRA, AFOSR, ONR, USF				Driving a shock wave through the interface between two materials with different densities can result in the Richtmyer-Meshkov or Rayleigh-Taylor instability and initial perturbations at the interface will grow. If the shock wave is sufficiently strong, the instability will lead to plastic flow at the interface. Material strength will reduce the amount of plastic flow and suppress growth. While such instabilities have been investigated in 2D, no studies of this phenomena have been performed in 3D on materials with strength. Initial perturbations to seed the hydrodynamic instability were coined into tantalum recovery targets. Two types of perturbations were used, two dimensional (2D) perturbations (hill and valley) and three-dimensional (3D) perturbations (egg crate pattern). The targets were subjected to dynamic loading using the Janus laser at the Jupiter Laser Facility. Shock pressures ranged from 50 GPa up to 150 GPa and were calibrated using VISAR drive targets.

Service robots, which co-exist with humans and provide various services in daily life, must have sufficient ability to sense changes in the environment and deal with a variety of situations. However, since the daily environment is complex and unpredictable, it is almost impossible with current methods to sense all the necessary information using only a robot and the attached sensors. One promising approach for robots to co-exist with humans is to use IT technology, such as a distributed sensor network and network robotics. As an empirical example of this approach, the authors have started Robot Town Project. The aim of this research project is to develop a distributed sensor network system covering an area of a block in a town in which there are many houses, buildings, and roads, and manage robot services by monitoring events that occur in the town. This paper introduces currently available technologies including an RFID-tag-based localization system, distributed sensor systems for moving object tracking, and object management systems using RFID tags. For the construction of 3-D geometrical models of large-scale environments, a measurement and modeling system using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder is also introduced.

We compare the modeled vertical distribution of clouds against the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosols Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) using a simulator approach. Although the overall pattern of modeled zonal cloud frequency profiles is relatively good (r=0.92 for the multi-model mean), we show two main systematic biases in the cloud frequency profiles: a positive bias above 7km (up to 10%), particularly in the tropics; and a negative bias below 3km (up to -10%), which reaches a maximum over the stratocumulus cloud regions. Using radiative heating rate profiles calculated with constraints from CloudSat, CALIPSO and other satellite observations, we show that the excess of clouds in the upper troposphere (> 7km) results in excess infrared and solar heating in the vicinity of the clouds as well as more infrared heating for the entire column below the cloud. On the other hand, the lack of clouds in the lower troposphere reduces the infrared cooling near the missing cloud levels and increases the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor below. The global radiative heating rate between 50 degrees S and 50 degrees N is too warm in the models (-0.81K/day vs. -1.01K/day). The representation of clouds in GCMs remains challenging, but reducing the cloud biases would lead to an improvement of the heating rate profiles, which in turn would help in improving other aspects of models' simulations such as the dynamics, cloud feedbacks and surface-atmosphere interactions.

Cloud Effects on Atmospheric Solar Absorption in Light of Most Recent Surface and Satellite Measurements	RADIATION PROCESSES IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Radiation Symposium (IRC/IAMAS) - Radiation Processes in the Atmosphere and Ocean	APR 16-22, 2016	Univ Auckland, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	Univ Auckland, Dept Phys, Kipp & Zonen, EKO Instruments Europe B V	Univ Auckland		RADIATION	At 36 locations worldwide, we estimate the cloud radiative effect (CREatm) on atmospheric solar absorption (ASR(atm)) by combining ground-based measurements of surface solar radiation (SSR) with collocated satellite-derived surface albedo and top-of-atmosphere net irradiance under both all-sky and clear-sky conditions. To derive continuous clear-sky SSR from Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) in-situ measurements of global and diffuse SSR, we make use of the Long and Ackerman (2000) algorithm that identifies clear-sky measurements and empirically fits diurnal clear-sky irradiance functions using the cosine of the solar zenith angle as the independent variable. The 11-year average (2000-2010) CREatm (all-sky minus clear-sky) is overall positive at around + 11 Wm(-2) using direct measurements form ground and space, and at 4 Wm(-2) in the CERES EBAF dataset. This discrepancy arises from a potential overestimation in clear-sky absorption by the satellite product or underestimation by the combined BSRN/CERES dataset. The forcing ratio R shows that clouds enhance ASRatm most distinctly at desert-like locations that overall experience little occurrence of clouds. This relationship is captured by both the combined dataset and CERES EBAF.

Periodicity in a photonic crystal structure enables engineering of the density of states to improve spontaneous light emission according to Fermi's golden rule. Unlike planar thin films, which suffer significantly from total internal reflection, a 3D architectured structure is distributed in space with many non-flat interfaces, which facilitates a substantial enhancement in light extraction. We demonstrate the fabrication of 3D nano-architectures with octahedron geometry that utilize luminescing silicon nanocrystals as active media with an aluminum cathode and indium tin oxide anode towards the realization of a 3D light emitting device. The developed fabrication procedure allows charge to pass through the nanolattice between two contacts for electroluminescence. These initial fabrication efforts suggest that 3D nano-architected devices are realizable and can reach greater efficiencies than planar devices.

Assessing Contact Graph Routing Performance and Reliability in Distributed Satellite Constellations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER NETWORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							TOLERANT NETWORKING; SYSTEMS; FAILURE; SPACE; DTN	Existing Internet protocols assume persistent end-to-end connectivity, which cannot be guaranteed in disruptive and high-latency space environments. To operate over these challenging networks, a store-carry-and-forward communication architecture called Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been proposed. This work provides the first examination of the performance and robustness of ContactGraph Routing (CGR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art routing scheme for space-basedDTNs. To this end, after a thorough description of CGR, two appealing satellite constellations are proposed and evaluated by means of simulations. Indeed, the DtnSim simulator is introduced as another relevant contribution of this work. Results enabled the authors to identify existing CGR weaknesses and enhancement opportunities.	[Fraire, J.

First Steps Towards Translating HZD Control of Bipedal Robots to Decentralized Control of Exoskeletons	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Exoskeletons; control design; robot control	WALKING	This paper presents preliminary results toward translating gait and control design for bipedal robots to decentralized control of an exoskeleton aimed at restoring mobility to patients with lower limb paralysis, without the need for crutches. A mathematical hybrid dynamical model of the human-exoskeleton system is developed and a library of dynamically feasible periodic walking gaits for different walking speeds is found through nonlinear constrained optimization using the full-order dynamical system. These walking gaits are stabilized using a centralized (i.e., full-state information) hybrid zero dynamics-based controller, which is then decentralized (i.e., control actions use partial state information) so as to be implementable on the exoskeleton subsystem. A control architecture is then developed so as to allow the user to actively control the exoskeleton speed through his/her upper body posture. Numerical simulations are carried out to compare the two controllers. It is found that the proposed decentralized controller not only preserves the periodic walking gaits but also inherits the robustness to perturbations present in the centralized controller. Moreover, the proposed velocity regulation scheme is able to reach a steady state and track desired walking speeds under both, centralized, and decentralized schemes.

We focus on the case of electricity markets and model the market as a game between a system operator (market maker) and generators at different nodes of the network. Generators submit quantity bids and the system operator balances demand and supply over the network subject to transmission constraints. We compare the efficiency of a networked Stackelberg equilibrium, where generators anticipate the market clearing actions of the market maker, with a networked Cournot equilibrium, where they do not. We show that networked Cournot equilibria always exists but its efficiency loss is unbounded in the worst case. In contrast, networked Stackelberg equilibria do not always exist, but in certain settings where they do exist, the efficiency loss may be bounded above by a constant.

Most 3D sensors produce dense depth maps, which are subject to imperfections due to various environmental factors. Temporal fusion of depth maps is crucial to overcome those. Temporal fusion is traditionally done in 3D space with voxel data structures, but it can be approached by temporal fusion in image space, with potential benefits in reduced memory and computational cost for applications like reactive collision avoidance for micro air vehicles. In this paper, we present an efficient Gaussian Mixture Models based depth map fusion approach, introducing an online update scheme for dense representations. The environment is modeled from an ego-centric point of view, where each pixel is represented by a mixture of Gaussian inverse-depth models. Consecutive frames are related to each other by transformations obtained from visual odometry. This approach achieves better accuracy than alternative image space depth map fusion techniques at lower computational cost.

This antenna is designed for telecommunication and is compatible with the NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) at Ka-band frequencies (uplink: 34.2-34.7 GHz and downlink: 31.8-32.3 GHz). Detailed simulations, considering all aspects of the circularly-polarized mesh deployable reflector antenna including the feed, show that 42.0-dBi gain and 57% aperture efficiency is achievable at 32GHz. The mechanical deployment mechanism is thoroughly described as it is a critical component of the deployable CubeSat antenna.

The purpose is to detect the weak THz radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by up-converting the signal into the optical domain via the nonlinearity of the medium. Such high-sensitivity receiver has theoretically shown capabilities towards photon counting at room temperature, however, it is critical to efficiently couple the THz radiation into the resonator. Therefore, by using the Schelkunoff-Waterman method (the so called T-matrix method) we perform an analytical evaluation of two different free-space coupling techniques: a free-space Gaussian beam, and a Gaussian beam incident in a silicon lens under total internal reflection. By comparing the excited modes in the resonator, the optimal parameters for each case are given.

This on-road FFCO2 emissions dataset for LA (from Hestia version 1.0), based on actual traffic volume, provides emissions per vehicle kilometer travelled (VKT)-an important metric for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. We further identify emissions hotpots that can help state and local policy makers plan the most effective GHG reduction strategies. On-road vehicle traffic accounts for half of the FFCO2 emissions in LA, of which 41% is from arterials (intermediate road type). Arterials also have the largest C emissions intensity-FFCO2 per VKT-possibly from high traffic congestion and fleet composition. Non-interstate emissions hotspots (> 419 tC lane-km(-1)) are equally dominated by arterials and collectors (the lowest road type) in terms of FFCO2 emissions though collectors have a higher VKT. These hotspots occur in densely populated areas and developed landuse classes, largely in LA (67%) and Orange (18%) counties, and provide specific targets for emissions reduction efforts. The estimated uncertainties for interstate, arterial and collector emissions per road length are +/- 2.1, +/- 0.5 and +/- 18.0%, respectively. Our overall estimates compare reasonably well with other products, DARTE and FIVE but with substantial differences in spatial distribution. The method for developing this dataset is easily replicable in other urban landscapes, and represents a powerful tool for carbon cycle science and regional policy makers.

Each element is placed in the gap of a balanced antenna. All the elements conform a 2D rectangular array. For avoiding issues related to having out-of-focus sources when using one electrically large silicon lens, two different strategies are considered: increasing the density of elements by using a compact design and using an array of dielectric rod waveguide antennas instead of the lens. Experimental considerations are also provided for two prototypes manufactured in the 1550 nm window. Measured power level will be shown at the conference.

B	Ramesham, R			IEEE	Ramesham, Rajeshuni			THERMAL CYCLING TESTING TO FAILURE OF A CERAMIC COLUMN GRID ARRAY PACKAGE FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS	2017 PAN PACIFIC MICROELECTRONICS SYMPOSIUM (PAN PACIFIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	Pan Pacific Microelectronics Symposium (Pan Pacific)	FEB 06-09, 2017	Kauuai, HI			Ceramic column grid array; CCGA 1752 (CN version) qualification; CCGA reliability; solder-joint failures; thermal cycling	RELIABILITY; CCGA	Ceramic column grid array (CCGA) packages have been used increasingly in logic and microprocessor functions, telecommunications, flight avionics boards, payload electronics boards, engineering navigational and science cameras, electronic assemblies, and other applications, because of their inherent advantages such as high electrical interconnect density, very good thermal and electrical performance, and compatibility with standard surface-mount technology (SMT) packaging assembly processes. Because these advanced electronic packages tend to have less solder-joint strain-relief than do leaded flat-pack electronic packages, the reliability of CCGA packages in challenging thermal environments is a very important consideration for their short-and long-term use in JPL-NASA space missions. In this study, we assembled daisy chains of polyimide printed wiring boards from CCGA-interconnect packages, inspected the boards nondestructively, and then subjected them to thermal cycling to assess their reliability in thermal environments from +125 degrees C to -40 degrees C +/- 25 degrees C. The test hardware consists of a CCGA 1752 package (CN version). The package was divided into four daisy-chained sections that were electrically monitored for their continuity during thermal cycling. The CCGA 1752 package is roughly 45 mm x 45 mm with a 42-mm x 42-mm array of 80%/20% Pb/Sn columns on a 1.00-mm pitch. The resistance of the daisy-chained CCGA interconnects was continuously monitored during thermal cycling in a gaseous nitrogen environment. Electrical continuity resistance measurements as a function of thermal cycling are reported here; tests to date have shown significant change to an open circuit in daisy-chain resistance as a function of thermal cycling. The change in interconnect resistance becomes increasingly noticeable with increasing number of thermal cycles. This paper describes the experimental thermal-cycling test results of CCGA 1752 package reliability testing under an extremely wide temperature range. The first failure was observed at 1479th thermal cycle. We report the thermalcycle reliability test data for 2500 thermal cycles.

A consequence of the collar lemma is that if two closed curves A and B on a closed orientable hyperbolizable surface intersect each other, then there is an explicit lower bound for the length of A in terms of the length of B, which holds for every hyperbolic structure on the surface. In this article, we prove an analog of the classical collar lemma in the setting of Hitchin representations.

However, the high cost of the video wall might make it unavailable when needed. The PiWall is a low-cost alternative for a traditional video wall. The PiWall project was built to meet very specific requirements, and therefore it has very limited applications. The most recognizable problem on the current system is that it needs to restart every time when a change on content being displayed is needed. Developing the PiWall system will widen the scope of its applications. The path to developing an enhanced PiWall system starts by examining the existing PiWall system and understanding its current limitations. Then defining the new requirements. After that proposing the design of the system. In addition, analyzing the source code and understanding how the system works. The next step is building the current system, and then gradually adding features and improvements. At the end, it is expected to have an improved PiWall system that has a variety of useful applications.

Genetic Analysis of Histamine Signaling in Larval Zebrafish Sleep	ENEURO			English	Article						genetics; histamine; hypocretin; sleep; wake	KNOCK-OUT MICE; HISTIDINE-DECARBOXYLASE; TUBEROMAMMILLARY NUCLEUS; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; H-3 RECEPTORS; OREXIN-A; BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERIZATION; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; THERAPEUTIC TARGET	Pharmacological studies in mammals and zebrafish suggest that histamine plays an important role in promoting arousal. However, genetic studies using rodents with disrupted histamine synthesis or signaling have revealed only subtle or no sleep/wake phenotypes. Studies of histamine function in mammalian arousal are complicated by its production in cells of the immune system and its roles in humoral and cellular immunity, which can have profound effects on sleep/wake states. To avoid this potential confound, we used genetics to explore the role of histamine in regulating sleep in zebrafish, a diurnal vertebrate in which histamine production is restricted to neurons in the brain. Similar to rodent genetic studies, we found that zebrafish that lack histamine due to mutation of histidine decarboxylase (hdc) exhibit largely normal sleep/wake behaviors. Zebrafish containing predicted null mutations in several histamine receptors also lack robust sleep/wake phenotypes, although we are unable to verify that these mutants are completely nonfunctional. Consistent with some rodent studies, we found that arousal induced by overexpression of the neuropeptide hypocretin (Hcrt) or by stimulation of hcrt- expressing neurons is not blocked in hdc or hrh1 mutants. We also found that the number of hcrt- expressing or histaminergic neurons is unaffected in animals that lack histamine or Hcrt signaling, respectively. Thus, while acute pharmacological manipulation of histamine signaling has been shown to have profound effects on zebrafish and mammalian sleep, our results suggest that chronic loss of histamine signaling due to genetic mutations has only subtle effects on sleep in zebrafish, similar to rodents.

How such diverse functions are mediated by a single hormonal system is not well understood. Different functions of oxytocin could be mediated by distinct cell groups, yet it is currently unknown whether different oxytocinergic cell types exist that specifically mediate peripheral neuroendocrine or various central neuromodulatory processes via dedicated pathways. Using the Brainbow technique to map the morphology and projections of individual oxytocinergic cells in the larval zebrafish brain, we report here the existence of two main types of oxytocinergic cells: those that innervate the pituitary and those that innervate diverse brain regions. Similar to the situation in the adult rat and the adult midshipman, but in contrast to the situation in the adult trout, these two cell types are mutually exclusive and can be distinguished based on morphological and anatomical criteria. Further, our results reveal that complex oxytocinergic innervation patterns are already established in the larval zebrafish brain.

A compact CMOS down-converter is designed which operates from 160 to 188 GHz and includes a sub-harmonically pumped I/Q resistive mixer, two IF amplifiers and a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) with LO buffer. A measured down-conversion gain of +2.6 dB is achieved with a total dc power consumption of 152 mW using the nominal supply of +1.2 V. The measurement results show a 3 dB IF bandwidth from 1 to 5 GHz and the VCO tuning range is from 85 to 89 GHz.

The voltage and power outputs over 3.7 V-DC and 1 mW necessary for charging lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries were accomplished using a 3D-printed packaging platform whose physical design and mechanical properties maximized the vibration transfer and effectively combined 10 or more individual energy harvesters into a compact unified stack.

The predicted Tg determined from the temperature-dependent density change in the MD model is consistent with the results in our measurements and previous works.

For the first time, we design and fabricate resonators of the same lateral dimensions but with different stacking layers, namely, Si, AlN-on-Si, and Al-on-AlN-on-Si. With both optical and electrical readout techniques, we measure the fundamental radial-extensional mode and its Q values and compare the observed and simulated energy dissipation. For the same device geometry, the results show that the bare Si device has the highest Q (11,304). Adding an AlN layer leads to a reduction in Q for the AlN-on-Si device by a factor of similar to 1.46 compared to bare Si device. Top layer metallization further compromises the Q by a factor of similar to 1.85. Modeling of the dissipation processes suggests that neither the thermoelastic damping (TED) nor the anchor loss is the limiting loss factor. A piezoelectric-specific loss mechanism known as charge redistribution loss and interface loss are both possible limiting mechanisms.

Traditional studies focused on optimizing the throughput of the system by proposing elaborate schemes able to reach the network capacity. With the shift toward distributed computing on mobile devices, performance and complexity become both critical factors that affect the efficiency of a coding strategy. Instantly decodable network coding presents itself as a new paradigm in network coding that trades off these two aspects. This paper review instantly decodable network coding schemes by identifying, categorizing, and evaluating various algorithms proposed in the literature. The first part of the manuscript investigates the conventional centralized systems, in which all decisions are carried out by a central unit, e.g., a base-station. In particular, two successful approaches known as the strict and generalized instantly decodable network are compared in terms of reliability, performance, complexity, and packet selection methodology. The second part considers the use of instantly decodable codes in a device-to-device communication network, in which devices speed up the recovery of the missing packets by exchanging network coded packets. Although the performance improvements are directly proportional to the computational complexity increases, numerous successful schemes from both the performance and complexity viewpoints are identified.

A conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometer consists of a terahertz mixer that mixes a received terahertz signal with a local oscillator signal to generate an intermediate frequency signal in the radio frequency (RF) range, where it can be easily processed and detected by RF electronics. Schottky diode mixers, superconductor -insulator superconductor (SIS) mixers and hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixers are the most commonly used mixers in conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers. While conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers offer high spectral resolution and high detection sensitivity levels at cryogenic temperatures, their dynamic range and bandwidth are limited by the low radiation power of existing terahertz local oscillators and narrow bandwidth of existing terahertz mixers. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach for heterodyne terahertz spectrometry based on plasmonic photomixing. The presented design replaces terahertz mixer and local oscillator of conventional heterodyne terahertz spectrometers with a plasmonic photomixer pumped by an optical local oscillator. The optical local oscillator consists of two wavelength-tunable continuous-wave optical sources with a terahertz frequency difference. As a result, the spectrometry bandwidth and dynamic range of the presented heterodyne spectrometer is not limited by radiation frequency and power restrictions of conventional terahertz sources. We demonstrate a proof-o-concept terahertz spectrometer with more than 90 dB dynamic range and 1 THz spectrometry bandwidth.

Design, simulation, and characterization of a radial opposed migration ion and aerosol classifier (ROMIAC)	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Jian Wang	DIFFERENTIAL MOBILITY ANALYZER; NANO-DMA; PARTICLE CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION; NM; NANOPARTICLES; SPECTROMETER; CLUSTERS; INLET	We present the design, simulation, and characterization of the radial opposed migration ion and aerosol classifier (ROMIAC), a compact differential electrical mobility classifier. We evaluate the performance of the ROMIAC using a combination of finite element modeling and experimental validation of two nearly identical instruments using tetra-alkyl ammonium halide mass standards and sodium chloride particles. Mobility and efficiency calibrations were performed over a wide range of particle diameters and flow rates to characterize ROMIAC performance under the range of anticipated operating conditions. The ROMIAC performs as designed, though performance deviates from that predicted using simplistic models of the instrument. The underlying causes of this non-ideal behavior are found through finite element simulations that predict the performance of the ROMIAC with greater accuracy than the simplistic models. It is concluded that analytical performance models based on idealized geometries, flows, and fields should not be relied on to make accurate a priori predictions about instrumental behavior if the actual geometry or fields deviate from the ideal assumptions. However, if such deviations are accurately captured, finite element simulations have the potential to predict instrumental performance. The present prototype of the ROMIAC maintains its resolution over nearly three orders of magnitude in particle mobility, obtaining sub-20 nm particle size distributions in a compact package with relatively low flow rate operation requirements.(c) 2017 American Association for Aerosol Research	[Mui, Wilton; Mai, Huajun; Seinfeld, John H.; Flagan, Richard C.] CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Downard, Andrew J.; Seinfeld, John H.; Flagan, Richard C.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA	Flagan, RC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.; Flagan, RC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.	flagan@caltech.edu			National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1236909]; National Science Foundation Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1144469]; Jacobs Institute for Molecular Engineering for Medicine	This research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant No. CBET-1236909 and a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE-1144469 (W.M.), and the Jacobs Institute for Molecular Engineering for Medicine (R.C.F. and A.J.D.).		37	5	5	1	9	TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC	PHILADELPHIA	530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA	0278-6826	1521-7388		AEROSOL SCI TECH	Aerosol Sci.

Novel positioning sensor with real-time feedback for improved postoperative positioning: pilot study in control subjects	CLINICAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						retinal detachment; pneumatic retinopexy; intraocular gas; device; postoperative positioning; vitrectomy; macular hole	MACULAR HOLE SURGERY	Introduction: Repair of retinal detachment frequently requires use of intraocular gas. Patients are instructed to position themselves postoperatively to appose the intraocular bubble to the retinal break(s). We developed a novel wearable wireless positioning sensor, which provides real-time audiovisual feedback on the accuracy of positioning. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers wore the wireless sensor for 3 hours while instructed to maintain their head tilted toward the 2 o'clock meridian with no audiovisual feedback. Positioning accuracy was recorded. The subjects repeated the experiment for 3 hours with the audiovisual feedback enabled. Results: With no audiovisual feedback, the percentage of time greater than 10 degrees out of position varied from 8.9% to 93.9%. With audiovisual feedback enabled, these percentages ranged from 9.4% to 65%. Three subjects showed significant improvement in their time out of position (P<0.01, Fisher's exact test). Four subjects demonstrated a nonsignificant improvement, and one subject had a significant increase in time out of position with feedback (P<0.01). When pooled, all subjects demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in degrees out of position (P<0.001, Wilcoxon test) and a statistically significant improvement in total time out of position (P<0.001). Conclusion: The novel positioning sensor showed improved positioning compliance in half of the healthy volunteers during our short pilot study. Other subjects derived little benefit from the feedback. The causes for this observation are unclear. However, given the significant improvement as a group, this new technology could be beneficial to patients who struggle with postoperative positioning.

We show that for fixed k, the maximum number of edges in a K-k,K-k-free semi-algebraic bipartite graph G = (P, Q E) in R-2 with vertical bar P vertical bar = m and vertical bar Q vertical bar = n is at most O ((mn)(2/3) + m + n), and this bound is tight. In dimensions d >= 3, we show that all such semi-algebraic graphs have at most C((mn)(d/(d+1)+epsilon) + m + n) edges, where epsilon is an arbitrarily small constant and C = C(d, k, t, epsilon). This result is a far-reaching generalization of the classical Szemeredi-Trotter incidence theorem. The proof combines tools from several fields: VC-dimension and shatter functions, polynomial partitioning, and Hilbert polynomials. We also present various applications of our theorem, for example, a general point-variety incidence bound in R-d, an improved bound for a d-dimensional variant of the Erdos unit distances problem, and more.

J	Bruno, OP; Cubillos, M				Bruno, Oscar P.; Cubillos, Max			ON THE QUASI-UNCONDITIONAL STABILITY OF BDF-ADI SOLVERS FOR THE COMPRESSIBLE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS AND RELATED LINEAR PROBLEMS	SIAM JOURNAL ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Navier-Stokes; quasi-unconditional stability; high-order; ADI; BDF; unconditional stability	HIGHER-ORDER; SCHEME	The companion paper "Higher-order in time quasi-unconditionally stable ADI solvers for the compressible Navier Stokes equations in 2D and 3D curvilinear domains," which is referred to as Part I in what follows, introduces ADI (alternating direction implicit) solvers of higher orders of temporal accuracy (orders s = 2 to 6) for the compressible Navier Stokes equations in two-and three-dimensional space. The proposed methodology employs the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) together with a quasilinear-like formulation, high-order extrapolation for nonlinear components, and the Douglas Gunn splitting. A variety of numerical results presented in Part I demonstrate in practice the theoretical convergence rates enjoyed by these algorithms, as well as their excellent accuracy and stability properties for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. In particular, the proposed schemes enjoy a certain property of "quasi-unconditional stability": for small enough (problem dependent) fixed values of the timestep Delta t, these algorithms are stable for arbitrarily fine spatial discretizations. The present contribution presents a mathematical basis for the observed performance of these algorithms. Short of providing stability theorems for the full Navier Stokes BDF-ADI solvers, this paper puts forth a number of stability proofs for BDF-ADI schemes as well as some related unsplit BDF schemes for a variety of related linear model problems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. These include proofs of quasi-unconditional stability for unsplit BDF schemes of orders 2 <= s <= 6, and even a proof of a form of unconditional stability for two-dimensional BDF-ADI schemes of order 2 for both convection and diffusion problems. Additionally, a set of numerical tests presented in this paper for the compressible Navier Stokes equation indicate that quasi-unconditional stability carries over to the fully nonlinear context.

The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film enhanced greatly from 0.6S/cm to 736S/cm after 1.25% of p-toluenesulfonic acid solution was doped into the PEDOT:PSS dispersion. The post-treatment using dimethyl sulfoxide further improved the conductivity to 1549S/cm. We found that the electro-optical properties of the polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) cells fabricated by the highly conductive PEDOT:PSS films were comparable to those constructed by ITO. This work reveals that highly conductive PEDOT:PSS film is a suitable material for manufacturing ITO-free liquid crystal devices.

While these quantities need not be equal in general, we show that the universal bounds agree if we take the supremum over the Bloch unit ball. For the supremum (of either of these quantities), we give the estimate Sigma(2)(B) < min(0.9, Sigma(2)), where Sigma(2) is the analogous quantity associated to the unit ball in the L-infinity norm on the Bloch space.

In parallel, there are also numerous studies pointing to the frontal alpha band asymmetry as a psychophysiological marker of depression. In this study, we explored the role of frontal alpha asymmetry as a potential factor explaining the cognitive problems accompanying depression. Twenty-six depressed and 26 control participants completed a reasoning task and underwent 5 minutes of electroencephalography recording. In line with the previous studies, depressed people showed difficulties with reasoning but we did not observe the relationship between frontal asymmetry in the alpha band and depression. However, we found that in the depressed group the frontal alpha asymmetry index was characterised by larger variance than in the control group, and it was also a strong predictor of cognitive functioning exclusively in the depressed group. Our results point to the disruption of a psychophysiological balance, reflected in changed frontal alpha asymmetry (into more left-sided frontal asymmetry in the alpha band, reflecting more right-sided cortical activity) as a possible brain correlate of cognitive disturbances present in depressive disorders.

Close Binary Progenitors and Ejected Companions of Thermonuclear Supernovae	20TH EUROPEAN WHITE DWARF WORKSHOP	Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	20th European Workshop on White Dwarfs (EuroWD)	JUL 25-29, 2016	Univ Warwick, Coventry, ENGLAND	European Res Council	Univ Warwick		STAR	Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes, which can be formed by common envelope ejection. Close sdB binaries with massive white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). We discovered such a progenitor candidate as well as a candidate for a surviving companion star, which escapes from the Galaxy. More candidates for both types of objects have been found by cross-matching known sdB stars with proper motion and light curve catalogues. We found 72 sdO/B candidates with high Galactic restframe velocities, 12 of them might be unbound to our Galaxy. Furthermore, we discovered the second-most compact sdB+WD binary known. However, due to the low mass of the WD companion, it is unlikely to be a SN Ia progenitor.

Engineering research and development can benefit greatly by looking into nature and finding engineering solutions by learning from animals' evolution and biological systems. Another relevant factor in the present context is highlighted by the statement of the Nobel laureate Richard Smalley: "Energy is the single most important problem facing humanity today.". This paper focuses on how the research and education in the area of Dynamic Systems can be geared towards these two considerations. In particular, recent advances in self-powered dynamic systems and bio-inspired dynamic systems are highlighted. Self-powered dynamic systems benefit by capturing wasted energy in a dynamic system and converting it into useful energy in the mode of a regenerative system, possibly in conjunction with renewable energies. Examples of solar-powered vehicles, regenerative vibration control, and energy harvesting are presented in the paper. Particularly, development of solar-powered quadrotor, octocopter, and tricopter airships are presented, a self-powered vibration control of a mass-spring system using electromagnetic actuators/generators, and piezoelectric flutter energy harvesting using bi-stable material are discussed. As examples of bio-inspired dynamic systems, flapping wing flying robots, vertical axis wind turbines inspired by fish schooling, propulsion inspired by jellyfish, and Psi Intelligent Control are given. In particular, various design and developments of bird-inspired and insect-inspired flapping wings with the piezoelectric and electromagnetic actuation mechanisms, a scaled vertical axis wind turbine farm consist of 4 turbines and the corresponding wind tunnel testing, jellyfish-inspired pulsing jet and experimenting the increase in efficiency of energy consumption, and a multi-agent/robotic based predictive control scheme inspired by Psi precognition (event or state not yet experienced). Examples of student projects and research carried out at Brunel University and the experimental rigs built (in all the mentioned areas) are discussed, as an integrated research and educational activity. For the analysis and understanding of the behavior of self-powered and bio-inspired systems, Optimal Uncertainty Quantification (OUQ) is used. OUQ establishes a unified analysis framework in obtaining optimized solutions of the dynamic systems responses, which takes into account uncertainties and incomplete information in the simulation of these systems.

One approach to achieving this capability are high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems that take advantage of high heat transfer boiling and condensation mechanisms. Advanced solar systems are also intermittent by their nature and their electrical generation is often out-of phase with electric utility power demand, and their required power system cycling reduces efficiency, performance (dispatchability), lifetime, and reliability. High temperature thermal energy storage (TES) at 300-600 degrees C enables these reflux boiling systems to simultaneously store thermal energy internally to increase the energy dispatchability of the associated solar system, as this can increase the power generation profile by several hours (up to 6-10 hours) per day. Many TES phase change materials (PCM's) exist including KNO3, NaNO3, LiBr/KBr, MgCl2/NaCl/KCl, Zn/Mg, and CuCl/NaCl, which have various operating melting points and different latent heats of fusion. Common, cost effective TES PCM's are FeCl2/NaCl/KCl mixtures, whose phase change temperature can be varied and controlled by simple composition adjustments. This paper presents and discusses unique "temperature-staged" thermal energy storage configurations using these TES materials and analysis of such systems integrated into high-heat-flux reflux boiling systems. In this specific application, the TES materials are designed to operate at staged temperatures surrounding an operating design point near 350 degrees C, while providing 18 kW of source heat transfer to operate a thermoacoustic power system during off-sun conditions (e.g., temporary cloud conditions, after sun-down). This work discusses relevant configurations, and critical thermal and entropy models of the TES configurations, which show the inherent minimization of thermal exergy during critical heat transfers within the configurations and systems envisioned.

However, fabrication of large-scale SWNT-based ICs is an enormously challenging, unsolved problem, and self-assembly is likely needed for critical steps. Over the past several years, methods have been introduced to created ordered carbon nanotube structures using DNA guided self-assembly. In this chapter, we briefly review the challenges involved in using DNA to assemble SWNT nanostructures, and then give detailed methods to assemble dense, aligned SWNT arrays. In particular, we discuss the preparation of DNA wrapped single-walled nanotubes (DNA-CNTs) using commercial carbon nanotube products that are suitable for electronics applications. Then, we discuss methods to characterize DNA-CNTs using fluid mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Finally, we give detailed procedures for assembly of DNA-CNTs into dense parallel arrays via linker induced surface assembly (LISA).

More precisely, we assume that the external potential decays suitably at infinity and the linear Schrodinger operator -+V-s admits exactly one bound state, which is ground state, for any s[0,1]. In the nonlinear setting, the ground state bifurcates into a manifold of (small) ground state solutions. We show that, if the initial condition is at the ground state manifold, bifurcated from the ground state of -+V-0, then, for any fixed s[0,1], as ?0, the solution will converge to the ground state manifold bifurcated from the ground state of -+V-s. Moreover, the limit is of the same mass to the initial condition.

Galaxy morphologies are determined visually using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the spectral energy distribution fitting code Code Investigating GALaxy Emission, we measure star formation rates, stellar masses, and 4000 (A) over circle break strengths. The latter are used to separate quiescent and star-forming galaxies (SFGs). From z similar to 1.3 to z similar to 0.2, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of cluster SFGs and quiescent galaxies decreases by factors of three and four, respectively. Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster population declines by a factor of 11, from 0.48 +/- 0.06 Gyr(-1) to 0.043 +/- 0.009 Gyr(-1). This strong overall sSFR evolution is driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of quiescent cluster galaxies increases from 28(-19)(+8)% to 88(-4)(+5)% over z similar to 1.3 to 0.2. The majority of the growth occurs at z greater than or similar to 0.9, where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field, a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity, suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies above z similar to 0.9, coupled with the field-level sSFRs of cluster SFGs, suggests that higher-redshift cluster galaxies are likely being quenched quickly. Assessing those timescales will require more accurate stellar population ages and star formation histories.

We spectroscopically measured with Keck/Multi-Object Spectrometer For Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) two galaxies multiply imaged by the cluster. Our analysis reveals a modest lens, with an effective Einstein radius of theta(e)(z = 2)= 12 +/- 1" enclosing 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(13) M-circle dot. We briefly discuss the SL properties of the cluster, using two different modeling techniques (see the text for details), and make the mass models publicly available (ftp://wise-ftp.tau.ac.il/pub/adiz/MACS1319/). Independently, we identified a noteworthy, young shell galaxy (SG) system forming around two likely interacting cluster members, 20". north of the brightest cluster galaxy. SGs are rare in galaxy clusters, and indeed, a simple estimate reveals that they are only expected in roughly one in several dozen, to several hundred, massive galaxy clusters (the estimate can easily change by an order of magnitude within a reasonable range of characteristic values relevant for the calculation). Taking advantage of our lens model best-fit, mass-to-light scaling relation for cluster members, we infer that the total mass of the SG system is similar to 1.3 x 10(11) M-circle dot, with a host-to-companion mass ratio of about 10:1. Despite being rare in high density environments, the SG constitutes an example to how stars of cluster galaxies are efficiently redistributed to the intra-cluster medium. Dedicated numerical simulations for the observed shell configuration, perhaps aided by the mass model, might cast interesting light on the interaction history and properties of the two galaxies.

For each, an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) canopy height model (CHM) was produced by subtracting a LiDAR digital terrain model from the TanDEM-X DSM. These InSAR CHMs were compared to a LiDAR CHM at a resolution of 25 m and led to biases from 0.77 to 1.56 m, r(2) from 0.68 to 0.38, and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) from 2.06 to 3.67 m. Two datasets acquired in similar conditions differed by 1.27m(RMSE). Differences in the interferometric baseline had the strongest effect on the DSMs (RMSE of 3.27 m between short and long baseline DSMs). The height of ambiguity therefore had a significant effect on the resulting canopy height. The effect of phenological changes on canopy height estimations was lower (RMSE of 2.30 m between leaf-on and leaf-off DSMs) and not highly significant. These results indicate that, despite variations in the acquisition conditions, a continuous TanDEM-X mosaic acquired with proper baselines could produce a reliable estimate of canopy surface elevations of evergreen closed-canopy boreal forests.

Multi-beam laser beacon propagation over lunar distance: comparison of predictions and measurements	FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATION AND ATMOSPHERIC PROPAGATION XXIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Free-Space Laser Communication and Atmospheric Propagation XXIX	JAN 30-FEB 01, 2017	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		laser beacon; uplink; scintillation index; atmospheric propagation		A multi-beam beacon was transmitted from the Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory ( OCTL) located at Table Mountain, CA to the Lunar Laser Space Terminal ( LLST), on-board the Lunar Atmospheric Dust and Environment Explorer ( LADEE) spacecraft, during NASA's recent Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration ( LLCD). The laser beacon ( 1568 +/- 0.1 nm) was square wave modulated and sensed by a quadrant sensor on LLST. While link acquisition and tracking proceeded with the sensed signal, on-board processing extracted power incident on the quadrant sensor and telemetered it down over the optical downlink. Subsequently, post-processing of the codewords received at OCTL retrieved the power time series recorded at LLST. Analysis comparing measured and predicted mean irradiance delivered to LLST consistently agreed to within < 1 decibel (dB). Irradiance fluctuations detected at LLST were reconciled with an uplink wave-propagation simulation model using Kolmogorov phase screens.

This design, optimized for operation across a wide range of illumination conditions, is focused on minimizing blinding from stray light, and providing reliable, accurate attitude information to point its narrow communication beam accurately to the future location of the ground terminal. Though our transceiver will transmit in the 1550 nm waveband and receive in the 1064 nm waveband, the system design relies heavily on reflective optical elements, extending flexibility to be modified for use at different wavebands. The design makes use of common path propagation among transmit, receive and pointing verification optical channels to maintain precise alignment among its components, and to naturally correct for element misalignment resulting from launch or thermal element perturbations. This paper presents the results of trade studies showing the evolution of the design, unique operational characteristics of the design, elements that help to maintain minimal stray light contamination, and preliminary results from development and initial testing of a functional aluminum test model.

In this paper, we discuss a downlink receiver concept capable of demodulating optical pulse-position modulated (PPM) waveforms with data rates varying from approximately 50 kbps up to 265 Mbps, using a range of PPM orders, slot widths, and code rates. The receiver operates on recorded timestamps corresponding to the times-of-arrival of photons detected by a photon-counting detector array followed by a commercial time-tagger. Algorithms are presented for slot, symbol, and frame synchronization as well as parameter estimation. Estimates of link performance are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation for an optical channel that includes optical losses, detector blocking, signal clock dynamics, and pointing-induced downlink fades. Based upon these simulation results, it is expected that link closure may be achieved with at least 3 dB of margin under a variety of relevant conditions.

We discuss the dependence of the AANR frequency range on the volume fraction of solid within the lattice and on the ratio of the low index core material to the high index shell material. Following the constraints set by simulations, we fabricate two types of nanolattice PhCs: (1) polymer core-germanium shell and (2) amorphous carbon core-germanium shell to enable experimental observation of 3D negative refraction and related dispersion phenomena at infrared and eventually optical frequencies.

A Comparison of Three Ion Sensing Circuits in a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engine	COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Circuits; Engine; Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI); Ion signal; Sensor	HCCI COMBUSTION; BOOSTED HCCI; POTASSIUM; CESIUM	The use of a spark plug ion sensor to detect combustion timing in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine is a technique that could alleviate the need for pressure transducers, a more expensive alternative. One disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty in obtaining a strong signal at lower equivalence ratios. This article addresses and compares three ion sensing circuitries, namely a voltage follower, a notch filter circuit that removes the 60-Hz wall noise, and a notch filter whose output is coupled to a custom-built "integrator" circuit. The circuit optimizations are aimed at improving signal strength and reliability. The ion signal present in the combustion chamber is experimentally investigated in a 1.9-L Volkswagen engine, modified for HCCI operation and fueled with gasoline. Experiments are conducted across different intake temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. It was found that the custom- built circuit provided the best ion signal strength and reliability.

The proposed approach employs two probe antennas, one fixed and one scanning, enabling to retrieve both amplitude and phase of the near field. This allows us to employ conventional near-field-to-far-field transformations, without the need to resort to phase retrieval approaches. The technique is first demonstrated on a standalone 60-GHz patch, showing the good agreement between the proposed method and a conventional (one probe) near-field characterization. Then, the method is applied to the characterization of embedded antennas operating in the 60-GHz and 94-GHz bands, and it is benchmarked with simulations and conventional far-field characterization techniques.

These mineral waters discharge with a temperature between 17 and 20 degrees C, show a very alkaline pH (up to 11.8), and have: Na-Cl/Ca-OH facies; dry residuum approximate to 200 mg/L; C-total < 3.0 mg/L; and extremely low Mg2+ and silica concentrations (< 0.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). CH4 isotopic composition (-24.4 parts per thousand < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 parts per thousand and 285 parts per thousand < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 parts per thousand) falls in the range of typical abiotic gas. In the case of Cabeco de Vide mineral waters, the understanding of the resource will help to preserve the mineral water quality, creating public interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Weinberg's soft graviton theorem in 2m+ 2 dimensions is re-expressed as a Ward identity for the gravitational S-matrix. The corresponding asymptotic symmetries are identified with 2m + 2-dimensional supertranslations. An alternate derivation of these asymptotic symmetries as diffeomorphisms which preserve finite-energy boundary conditions at null infinity and act non-trivially on physical data is given. Our results differ from those of previous analyses whose stronger boundary conditions precluded supertranslations for d > 4.

Different strategies have been implemented to reduce the shuttle effects, with limited success, especially through use of low sulfur loadings (1-2 mg/cm(2)). Dense electrodes with high sulfur loadings are essential for high energy cells, however, such electrodes experience more serious polysulfide effects. In this paper, we describe the benefits of blending sulfur with a transition metal sulfide (here, TiS2 and MoS2) to form dense composite cathodes with enhanced conductivity. There is an improvement in both the initial capacity from sulfur utilization (similar to 800 mAh/g based on sulfur content), the coulombic efficiency (>96%) and also in cycle life upon blending with the metal sulfide. High sulfur loadings (>12 mg/cm(2) or similar to 6 mAh/cm(2) per side) were demonstrated to display high sulfur utilization in Li-S cells containing the metal sulfide blends either with or without coatings over the sulfur cathode. XRD studies were carried out to understand the redox behavior of the metal sulfide additive during charge/discharge cycling of the sulfur cathodes. DC polarization and Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) measurements were made on sulfur cathodes with and without metal sulfide blends to determine the charge transfer and diffusional kinetics.

Experimental Model Validation of High Aspect Ratio Through-Hole Filling by Additive-Assisted Copper Electrodeposition	JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							POLYETHYLENE-GLYCOL; WETTABILITY; DEPOSITION	A multi-element, time-dependent model developed by Childers et al. [A.S. Childers, M.T. Johnson, J. Ramirez-Rico, and K.T. Faber, J. Electrochem. Soc., 160:3093-3102, 2013] for copper infiltration of large (similar to 50-200 mu m diameter), high aspect ratio (similar to 60) through-hole channels was experimentally tested for validity. The model built on the work of Akolkar and Landau [R. Akolkar and U. Landau, J. Electrochem. Soc., 151: 702-711, 2004] for copper deposition in micro-scale integrated circuitry. Childers' model broadens the original by including the transport and adsorption of all electrolyte species - inhibitors, accelerators, and copper ions. The resultingmodel is tested experimentally with wood-derived biomorphic carbon materials. Results indicate that model predictions of premature pore choke off are in agreement with quantitative observations of copper infiltration and qualitative imaging of plated pore profiles. Low accelerator concentrations (0.002 ppm) yielded the highest quantity of copper infiltration without premature closure. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.	[Johnson, M.

J	Hou, TY; Li, Q; Zhang, P				Hou, Thomas Y.; Li, Qin; Zhang, Pengchuan			A SPARSE DECOMPOSITION OF LOW RANK SYMMETRIC POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES	MULTISCALE MODELING & SIMULATION			English	Article						intrinsic sparse mode decomposition; principal component analysis; sparse PCA; joint diagonalization; pivoted Cholesky decomposition; matrix factorization	WANNIER FUNCTIONS; FLOWS	Suppose that A is an element of R-N x N is symmetric positive semidefinite with rank K <= N. Our goal is to decompose A into K rank-one matrices Sigma(K)(k-1) gkgT(k) where the modes {gk}(K)(k=1) are required to be as sparse as possible. In contrast to eigendecomposition, these sparse modes are not required to be orthogonal. Such a problem arises in random field parametrization where A is the covariance function and is intractable to solve in general. In this paper, we partition the indices from 1 to N into several patches and propose to quantify the sparseness of a vector by the number of patches on which it is nonzero, which is called patchwise sparseness. Our aim is to find the decomposition which minimizes the total patchwise sparseness of the decomposed modes. We propose a domain decomposition type method, called intrinsic sparse mode decomposition (ISMD), which follows the "local-modes-construction broken vertical bar patching-up" procedure. The key step in the ISMD is to construct local pieces of the intrinsic sparse modes by a joint diagonalization problem. Thereafter, a pivoted Cholesky decomposition is utilized to glue these local pieces together. Optimal sparse decomposition, consistency with different domain decomposition, and robustness to small perturbation are proved under the so-called regular-sparse assumption (see Definition 1.2). We provide simulation results to show the efficiency and robustness of the ISMD. We also compare the ISMD to other existing methods, e.g., eigendecomposition, pivoted Cholesky decomposition, and convex relaxation of sparse principal component analysis [R. LAI, J. LU, AND S.

Temporal expression of CD184(CXCR4) and CD171(L1CAM) identifies distinct early developmental stages of human retinal ganglion cells in embryonic stem cell derived retina	EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH			English	Article						Retinal organoid; Retinal ganglion cell; Stem cell derived retina; CD184(CXCR4); CD171 (L1CAM); Retina development; RBPMS	RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; INNER LIMITING MEMBRANE; VESICLE-LIKE STRUCTURES; OPTIC-NERVE; COMPETENCE STATE; MATH5; GENE; AMACRINE; AXONS; DEATH	Human retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have anticipated value for human disease study, drug screening, and therapeutic applications; however, their full potential remains underdeveloped. To characterize RGCs in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived retinal organoids we examined RGC markers and surface antigen expression and made comparisons to human fetal retina. RGCs in both tissues exhibited CD184 and CD171 expression and distinct expression patterns of the RGC markers BRN3 and RBPMS. The retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) of retinal organoids expressed CD184, consistent with its expression in the neuroblastic layer in fetal retina. In retinal organoids CD184 expression was enhanced in RGC competent RPCs and high CD184 expression was retained on post mitotic RGC precursors; CD171 was detected on maturing RGCs. The differential expression timing of CD184 and CD171 permits identification and enrichment of RGCs from retinal organoids at differing maturation states from committed progenitors to differentiating neurons. These observations will facilitate molecular characterization of PSC-derived RGCs during differentiation, critical knowledge for establishing the veracity of these in vitro produced cells. Furthermore, observations made in the retinal organoid model closely parallel those in human fetal retina further validating use of retinal organoid to model early retinal development.

Previous work has shown that this is impossible, unless the agents and planner have sufficient information about each other and common knowledge. These results have remained largely theoretical because the required information is generally not available in practical applications. However, recent work has shown that these limitations can be overcome in simple settings, using neurometric technologies that provide noisy signals of subjects' preferences that can be used in the mechanism design problem. Here we build on this work by carrying out two new experiments designed to test the extent to which these Neurometrically Informed Mechanisms (NIMs) can be applied to more complicated and realistic environments. We find robustness to large type and action space and to the degrees of loss and risk-aversion observed in most of our sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Individuals have private information about contribution costs. Individuals can each make a discrete contribution. If the number of contributors is at least equal to the threshold, a public benefit accrues to all members of the group. We experimentally implement three different communication structures prior to the decision move: (a) simultaneous exchange of binary messages, (b) larger finite numerical message space and (c) unrestricted text chat. We obtain theoretical bounds on the efficiency gains that are obtainable under these different communication structures. In an experiment with three person groups and a threshold of two, we observe significant efficiency gains only with the richest of these communication structures, where participants engage in unrestricted text chatting. In that case, the efficiency bounds implied by mechanism design theory are achieved. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Because BMGs properties are highly correlated with processing, it is necessary to test them in a relevant engineering application. In the current work, CuZr-based BMGs are developed with excellent wear performance when used as gears. It is shown that in order to optimize the wear performance of these gears, toughness should be maximized. This contrasts the conventional design strategy, where wear performance increases with increasing hardness. Finally, a new low-cost manufacturing method for casting net- shaped macroscale gears is developed.

J	Ni, Y; Zhang, XR				Ni, Yi; Zhang, Xingru			Detection of knots and a cabling formula for A-polynomials	ALGEBRAIC AND GEOMETRIC TOPOLOGY			English	Article							DEHN SURGERY; HOLOMORPHIC DISKS; VARIETIES	We say that a given knot J subset of S-3 is detected by its knot Floer homology and A-polynomial if whenever a knot K subset of S-3 has the same knot Floer homology and the same A-polynomial as J, then K D J. In this paper we show that every torus knot T. p; q/is detected by its knot Floer homology and A-polynomial. We also give a one-parameter family of infinitely many hyperbolic knots in S-3 each of which is detected by its knot Floer homology and A-polynomial. In addition we give a cabling formula for the A-polynomials of cabled knots in S-3, which is of independent interest. In particular we give explicitly the A-polynomials of iterated torus knots.

The catalog is based on Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys observations of the COSMOS field (centered at R. A.: 10(h)00(m)28(s), Decl.: + 02 degrees 12'21 ''). The final catalog has 38671 sources with photometric data in 42 bands from UV to the infrared (similar to 0.3-8 mu m). This includes broadband photometry from HST, CFHT, Subaru, the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy, and Spitzer Space Telescope in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands along with intermediate-and narrowband photometry from Subaru and medium-band data from Mayall NEWFIRM. Source detection was conducted in the WFC3 F160W band (at 1.6 mu m) and photometry is generated using the Template FITting algorithm. We further present a catalog of the physical properties of sources as identified in the HST F160W band and measured from the multi-band photometry by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions of sources against templates.

Thermoelectric heat recovery from glass melt processes	ENERGY			English	Article						High temperature thermoelectrk; Glass process; Industrial heat recovery	WASTE HEAT; EFFICIENCY; STRESS	Thermoelectric energy recovery from waste heat in glass melting process is investigated without any detrimental design or process changes. Melting glass pellets require a furnace with temperature over 1500 degrees C for downstream glass shaping processes and hence a large amount of exergy is available but currently destroyed. Due to high temperature gradients, parasitic losses are investigated in conjunction with the optimum thermoelectric design for maximum power output and the lowest cost. Among variations of thermal paths, the fireports are identified as the best potential for lowest cost. By partially replacing the refractory wall in thickness with a thermoelectric generator, heat loss is kept at the current 9 kW/m(2). High temperature gradients across the thermoelectric generator requires a water cooling heat sink. The cost of the heat sink is included in the overall energy and cost analysis. Based on a typical thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT = 1), optimally designed thermoelectric integrated system generates 55.6 kW of electricity with efficiency of over 15% from a 500 ton/day (5.8 kg/s) scale glass production at an additional cost of $ 1-2/W. This technology can provide 1.37 billion kWh of primary energy savings annually, if it is implemented throughout the whole glass industry in U.S. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interleukin-15 promotes intestinal dysbiosis with butyrate deficiency associated with increased susceptibility to colitis	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; EPITHELIAL-CELLS; GUT MICROBIOTA; FECAL BUTYRATE; T-CELLS; BACTERIA; IL-15; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCES; GENE	Dysbiosis resulting in gut-microbiome alterations with reduced butyrate production are thought to disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis and promote complex immune disorders. However, whether and how dysbiosis develops before the onset of overt pathology remains poorly defined. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is upregulated in distressed tissue and its overexpression is thought to predispose susceptible individuals to and have a role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the immunological roles of IL-15 have been largely studied, its potential impact on the microbiota remains unexplored. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA-based inventories of bacterial communities in mice overexpressing IL-15 in the intestinal epithelium (villin-IL-15 transgenic (v-IL-15tg) mice) shows distinct changes in the composition of the intestinal bacteria. Although some alterations are specific to individual intestinal compartments, others are found across the ileum, cecum and feces. In particular, IL-15 overexpression restructures the composition of the microbiota with a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria that is associated with a reduction in luminal butyrate levels across all intestinal compartments. Fecal microbiota transplant experiments of wild-type and v-IL-15tg microbiota into germ-free mice further indicate that diminishing butyrate concentration observed in the intestinal lumen of v-IL-15tg mice is the result of intrinsic alterations in the microbiota induced by IL-15. This reconfiguration of the microbiota is associated with increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Altogether, this study reveals that IL-15 impacts butyrate-producing bacteria and lowers butyrate levels in the absence of overt pathology, which represent events that precede and promote intestinal inflammatory diseases.

We show that when the number of competing firms is unknown the underlying parameters of the model can still be identified and estimated employing recently developed results on measurement errors. We illustrate our methodology using UK data for personal digital assistants and employ the estimates to simulate competitive effects.

The spacecraft launched on 18 November 2013, entered Mars orbit on 22 September 2014, and continues to acquire measurements of Mars's upper atmosphere in an effort to understand the loss of Martian volatiles to space. The navigation team is responsible for estimating and predicting the spacecraft's position and velocity, and designing and reconstructing propulsive maneuvers. After Mars orbit insertion, the team faced additional challenges unique to the mission's orbit and tracking data schedule, including the determination of the atmospheric density at each periapsis, which is necessary to keep the spacecraft within a predefined density corridor. This paper briefly describes the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, shows how it fits into previous and ongoing Mars exploration efforts, and overviews the operations of the navigation team from launch through the nominal science phase.

J	Lobbia, MA				Lobbia, Marcus A.			Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of Waverider-Derived Crew Reentry Vehicles	JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS			English	Article							HL-20; ENVIRONMENT	The development of a multidisciplinary design optimization framework for crew reentry vehicles is presented. A waverider design methodology is used as the basis for the parametric design technique, with required modifications (e.g., leading edge blunting and integration of a cylindrical payload volume representing the crew compartment) used to allow the generation of practical reentry configurations. In addition to the shape design code, aerodynamics analysis, mass estimating, and trajectory/aeroheating analyses are linked using a multiobjective genetic algorithm optimization process to maximize vehicle downrange, additional payload mass capability, and lift-to-drag ratio. Pareto fronts were generated for three different launch vehicle capabilities ranging from 12,000 to 26,000kg to orbit, and highlight the relationships between reentry vehicle payload mass, maximum lift-to-drag ratio, and downrange, as well as the fact that a medium-class or larger launch vehicle was required to meet the baseline mission payload mass requirement. Although the modifications necessary for the crew reentry vehicle mission resulted in a substantial reduction in lift-to-drag ratio relative to the idealized waveriders used in the design process, comparisons of several designs to the NASA HL-20 concept indicated that the waverider-derived design process can produce vehicles with an almost 30% improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio and the ability to carry additional payload mass on longer downrange trajectories.

Effects of differential diffusion on ignition of stoichiometric hydrogen-air by moving hot spheres	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Hot surface ignition; Differential diffusion; Minimum ignition temperature; Hydrogen-air detailed chemistry	COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE; PARTICLES	Studying thermal ignition mechanisms is a key step for evaluating many ignition hazards. In the present work, two-dimensional simulations with detailed chemistry are used to study the effect of differential diffusion on the prediction of ignition thresholds of a stoichiometric hydrogen-air mixture by moving hot spheres. Numerical experiments showed an increase of 40 K in the minimum ignition temperature required for ignition when diffusion of species at different rates is taken into account. Detailed analysis of the species profiles at the ignition location and a sensitivity study of the system to the diffusivity of H-2 and H revealed the key role played by the diffusion of H atoms in preventing ignition to take place at temperatures below 1000 K.

Experimental and numerical studies of fuel and hydrodynamic effects on piloted turbulent premixed jet flames	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Premixed turbulence; Jet flames; PIV; LES; Hydrocarbon fuels	SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE; SUBGRID-SCALE CLOSURE; DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION; BURNING VELOCITY; COMBUSTION; MODEL; PROPAGATION; TRANSPORT; METHANE; BURNER	An experimental and numerical investigation of fuel and hydrodynamic effects is performed on piloted pre-mixed jet flames. The investigation is carried out at a constant laminar flame speed, varying heat losses, jet Reynolds number, fuel molecular weight, and fuel chemical classification. Large Eddy Simulations are performed in an attempt to reproduce the behaviors observed experimentally. Simulations are compared against well-characterized boundary conditions, well-resolved two-dimensional velocity fields from particle image velocimetry, and line-of-sight CH* profiles. Experimental results indicate that small amounts of heat losses may play a significant role on the jet reactivity as the flame heights scale with the heat loss from the jet. However, differences between flames with different fuels can still be seen in the absence of heat losses and these differences are magnified at higher Reynolds numbers. Particularly, methane flames are consistently taller and ethylene flames consistently shorter while other fuels present approximately the same flame height. LES reproduce the experimentally observed trends in global flame heights (effects of heat losses and Reynolds number) but some of the differences between fuels are not captured.

Multiinstrument observations of a geomagnetic storm and its effects on the Arctic ionosphere: A case study of the 19 February 2014 storm	RADIO SCIENCE			English	Article							TOTAL ELECTRON-CONTENT; SPACE WEATHER; RING CURRENT; PHASE; IRREGULARITIES; SCINTILLATIONS; TIMED/GUVI; MORPHOLOGY; LATITUDES; IMPACT	We present a multiinstrumented approach for the analysis of the Arctic ionosphere during the 19 February 2014 highly complex, multiphase geomagnetic storm, which had the largest impact on the disturbance storm-time index that year. The geomagnetic storm was the result of two powerful Earth-directed coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It produced a strong long lasting negative storm phase over Greenland with a dominant energy input in the polar cap. We employed global navigation satellite system (GNSS) networks, geomagnetic observatories, and a specific ionosonde station in Greenland. We complemented the approach with spaceborne measurements in order to map the state and variability of the Arctic ionosphere. In situ observations from the Canadian CASSIOPE (CAScade, Smallsat and IOnospheric Polar Explorer) satellite's ion mass spectrometer were used to derive ion flow data from the polar cap topside ionosphere during the event. Our research specifically found that (1) thermospheric O/N-2 measurements demonstrated significantly lower values over the Greenland sector than prior to the storm time. (2) An increased ion flow in the topside ionosphere was observed during the negative storm phase. (3) Negative storm phase was a direct consequence of energy input into the polar cap. (4) Polar patch formation was significantly decreased during the negative storm phase. This paper addresses the physical processes that can be responsible for this ionospheric storm development in the northern high latitudes. We conclude that ionospheric heating due to the CME's energy input caused changes in the polar atmosphere resulting in Ne upwelling, which was the major factor in high-latitude ionosphere dynamics for this storm.

J	Spunt, RP; Ellsworth, E; Adolphs, R				Spunt, Robert P.; Ellsworth, Emily; Adolphs, Ralph			The neural basis of understanding the expression of the emotions in man and animals	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anthropomorphism; emotion attribution; face perception; social cognition	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL COGNITION; MIND; BEHAVIOR; HUMANS; BRAIN; ANTHROPOMORPHISM; DIMENSIONS; SYSTEMS; EMPATHY	Humans cannot help but attribute human emotions to non-human animals. Although such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about each other's internal states, they may be the product of a general mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to humans and non-human animal behavior. Although undergoing fMRI, participants first passively observed the facial displays of human, non-human primate and domestic dogs, and subsequently judged the acceptability of emotional (e.g. 'annoyed') and facial descriptions (e.g. 'baring teeth') for the same images. For all targets, emotion attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies. These regions were similarly activated by both human and non-human targets even during the passive observation task; moreover, the degree of neural similarity was dependent on participants' self-reported beliefs in the mental capacities of non-human animals. These results encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding, one that treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than the idea that humans other than ourselves do.

Evaluation of Materials in a Biomechanical System for Uses in Industrial Lifting Activities	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								A biomechanical system is proposed for the emulation of the movement of human arm, leg, and spine movements, as an industry alternative to manage heavy operations in a manufacturing process. The Matlab (R) programming environment is used as a simulation tool for the analysis and validation of this proposed biomechanism. This machine would reduce the accidents due to human exposure to risky industry environments like the particular one at the host company that we are using as a model for our research. They claim that the accidents in this area alone arise to around thirty percent of the total, causing a decrease in the productivity of the company and other economic losses derived from the worker injuries and insurances.

LigoDV-web: Providing easy, secure and universal access to a large distributed scientific data store for the LIGO scientific collaboration	ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING			English	Article								Gravitational-wave observatories around the world, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), record a large volume of gravitational-wave output data and auxiliary data about the instruments and their environments. These data are stored at the observatory sites and distributed to computing clusters for data analysis. LigoDV-web is a web-based data viewer that provides access to data recorded at the LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston and GE0600 observatories, and the 40 m prototype interferometer at Caltech. The challenge addressed by this project is to provide meaningful visualizations of small data sets to anyone in the collaboration in a fast, secure and reliable manner with minimal software, hardware and training required of the end users. LigoDV-web is implemented as a Java Enterprise Application, with Shibboleth Single Sign On for authentication and authorization, and a proprietary network protocol used for data access on the back end. Collaboration members with proper credentials can request data be displayed in any of several general formats from any Internet appliance that supports a modern browser with Javascript and minimal HTML5 support, including personal computers, smartphones, and tablets. Since its inception in 2012, 634 unique users have visited the LigoDV-web website in a total of 33, 861 sessions and generated a total of 139, 875 plots. This infrastructure has been helpful in many analyses within the collaboration including follow-up of the data surrounding the first gravitational-wave events observed by LIGO in 2015.

(2016) analyze the effect of electron temperature anisotropy on proton mirror instability. They find that the electron whistler instability grows faster and consumes all the available electron free energy so that no anisotropy is left to fuel the proton mirror mode growth. In this comment we present both observational and theoretical arguments about why we think this is incorrect.	[Remya, B.] Acad Sinica, Inst Earth Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Reddy, R. V.; Lakhina, G.

In these experiments, pressure and temperature were varied in such a way that we produced a series of liquids, each with an approximately constant composition (similar to 12, similar to 15, and similar to 21 wt% MgO). Previously, we used a similar approach to show that D-Ni(ol/liq) for a liquid with similar to 18 wt% MgO is a strong function of temperature. Combining the new data presented here with our previous results allows us to separate the effects of temperature from composition. We fit our data based on a Ni-Mg exchange reaction, which yields ln (D-Ni(molar)) = -Delta H-r(1)degrees(P)(Tref,)(ref)/RT + Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R - In(X-Mgo(liq)/X(Mgsi0.5)(ol)o(2)) Each subset of constant composition experiments displays roughly the same temperature dependence of D-Ni(ol/liq) (i. e., Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(Pref)/R) as previously reported for liquids with similar to 18 wt% MgO. Fitting new data presented here (15 experiments) in conjunction with our 13 previously published experiments (those with similar to 18 wt% MgO in the silicate liquid) to the above expression gives -Delta H-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = 3641 +/- 396 (K) and Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = -1.597 +/- 0.229. Adding data from the literature yields -Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = 4505 +/- 196 (K) and Delta S-r(1)degrees(Tref),(P)(ref)/R = -2.075 +/- 0.120, a set of coefficients that leads to a predictive equation for D-Ni(ol/liq) applicable to a wide range of melt compositions. We use the results of our work to model the melting of peridotite beneath lithosphere of varying thickness and show that: (1) a positive correlation between NiO in magnesian olivine phenocrysts and lithospheric thickness is expected given a temperature-dependent D-Ni(ol/liq), and (2) the magnitude of the slope for natural samples is consistent with our experimentally determined temperature dependence. Alternative processes to generate the positive correlation between NiO in magnesian olivines and lithospheric thickness, such as the melting of olivine-free pyroxenite, are possible, but they are not required to explain the observed correlation of NiO concentration in initially crystallizing olivine with lithospheric thickness.

Tidally induced variations in vertical and horizontal motion on Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, inferred from remotely sensed observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						synthetic aperture radar; glacier mechanics; ice-ocean interactions; ice shelf buttressing; ice-bed mechanics; ice rheology	RADAR INTERFEROMETRY; BASAL MECHANICS; PINE ISLAND; OCEAN TIDES; INSAR DATA; VELOCITY; FLOW; MARGINS; SHELF; BED	To better understand the influence of stress changes over floating ice shelves on grounded ice streams, we develop a Bayesian method for inferring time-dependent 3-D surface velocity fields from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. Our specific goal is to observe ocean tide-induced variability in vertical ice shelf position and horizontal ice stream flow. Thus, we consider the special case where observed surface displacement at a given location can be defined by a 3-D secular velocity vector, a family of 3-D sinusoidal functions, and a correction to the digital elevation model used to process the SAR data. Using nearly 9months of SAR data collected from multiple satellite viewing geometries with the COSMO-SkyMed 4-satellite constellation, we infer the spatiotemporal response of Rutford Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to ocean tidal forcing. Consistent with expected tidal uplift, inferred vertical motion over the ice shelf is dominated by semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents. Horizontal ice flow variability, on the other hand, occurs primarily at the fortnightly spring-neap tidal period (M-sf). We propose that periodic grounding of the ice shelf is the primary mechanism for translating vertical tidal motion into horizontal flow variability, causing ice flow to accelerate first and most strongly over the ice shelf. Flow variations then propagate through the grounded ice stream at a mean rate of approximate to 29km/d and decay quasi-linearly with distance over approximate to 85km upstream of the grounding zone.

J	Malatesta, LC; Prancevic, JP; Avouac, JP				Malatesta, Luca C.; Prancevic, Jeffrey P.; Avouac, Jean-Philippe			Autogenic entrenchment patterns and terraces due to coupling with lateral erosion in incising alluvial channels	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE			English	Article						terrace; autogenic; entrenchment; fill-cut	CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIAN-SHAN; NORTHWESTERN COLORADO; GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES; FLUVIAL TERRACES; WASHINGTON-STATE; DRAINAGE-BASIN; NORTH FLANK; TIEN-SHAN; RIVER	The abandonment of terraces in incising alluvial rivers can be used to infer tectonic and climatic histories. A river incising into alluvium erodes both vertically and laterally as it abandons fill-cut terraces. We argue that the input of sediment from the valley walls during entrenchment can alter the incision dynamics of a stream by promoting vertical incision over lateral erosion. Using a numerical model, we investigate how valley wall feedbacks may affect incision rates and terrace abandonment as the channel becomes progressively more entrenched in its valley. We postulate that erosion of taller valley walls delivers large pulses of sediment to the incising channel, potentially overwhelming the local sediment transport capacity. Based on field observations, we propose that these pulses of sediment can form talus piles that shield the valley wall from subsequent erosion and potentially force progressive channel narrowing. Our model shows that this positive feedback mechanism can enhance vertical incision relative to 1-D predictions that ignore lateral erosion. We find that incision is most significantly enhanced when sediment transport rates are low relative to the typical volume of material collapsed from the valley walls. The model also shows a systematic erosion of the youngest terraces when river incision slows down. The autogenic entrenchment due to lateral feedbacks with valley walls should be taken into account in the interpretation of complex-response terraces.

The calorimeter of the Mu2e experiment at Fermilab	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Topical Seminar on Innovative Particle and Radiation Detectors	OCT 03-06, 2016	Siena, ITALY			Calorimeters; Radiation-hard detectors		The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab looks for Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) improving by 4 orders of magnitude the current experimental sensitivity for the muon to electron conversion in a muonic atom. A positive signal could not be explained in the framework of the current Standard Model of particle interactions and therefore would be a clear indication of new physics. In 3 years of data taking, Mu2e is expected to observe less than one background event mimicking the electron coming from muon conversion. Achieving such a level of background suppression requires a deep knowledge of the experimental apparatus: a straw tube tracker, measuring the electron momentum and time, a cosmic ray veto system rejecting most of cosmic ray background and a pure CsI crystal calorimeter, that will measure time of flight, energy and impact position of the converted electron. The calorimeter has to operate in a harsh radiation environment, in a 10(-4) Torr vacuum and inside a 1 T magnetic field. The results of the first qualification tests of the calorimeter components are reported together with the energy and time performances expected from the simulation and measured in beam tests of a small scale prototype.

Such capability exists at larger than 4-mm overall diameters. We report the development of a stereo imaging endoscope of 4-mm maximum diameter, called Multiangle, Rear-Viewing Endoscopic Tool (MARVEL) that uses a single-lens system with complementary multibandpass filter (CMBF) technology to achieve 3-D imaging. In addition, the system is endowed with the capability to pan from side-to-side over an angle of +/- 25 deg, which is another unique aspect of MARVEL for such a class of endoscopes. The design and construction of a single-lens, CMBF aperture camera with integrated illumination to generate 3-D images, and the actuation mechanism built into it is summarized.

We explored the extent of genomic robustness in budding yeast by genome wide dosage suppressor analysis of 53 conditional lethal mutations in cell division cycle and RNA synthesis related genes, revealing 660 suppressor interactions of which 642 are novel. This collection has several distinctive features, including high cooccurrence of mutant-suppressor pairs within protein modules, highly correlated functions between the pairs and higher diversity of functions among the co-suppressors than previously observed. Dosage suppression of essential genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits and chromosome cohesion complex suggests a surprising degree of functional plasticity of macromolecular complexes, and the existence of numerous degenerate pathways for circumventing the effects of potentially lethal mutations. These results imply that organisms and cancer are likely able to exploit the genomic robustness properties, due the persistence of cryptic gene and pathway functions, to generate variation and adapt to selective pressures.

Continuum viscoplastic simulation of a granular column collapse on large slopes: mu(I) rheology and lateral wall effects	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS			English	Article							NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS; FLOW; EVOLUTION; MODEL; MASS	We simulate here dry granular flows resulting from the collapse of granular columns on an inclined channel (up to 22 degrees) and compare precisely the results with laboratory experiments. Incompressibility is assumed despite the dilatancy observed in the experiments (up to 10%). The 2-D model is based on the so-called mu(I) rheology that induces a Drucker-Prager yield stress and a variable viscosity. A nonlinear Coulomb friction term, representing the friction on the lateral walls of the channel, is added to the model. We demonstrate that this term is crucial to accurately reproduce granular collapses on slopes greater than or similar to 10 degrees, whereas it remains of little effect on the horizontal slope. Quantitative comparison between the experimental and numerical changes with time of the thickness profiles and front velocity makes it possible to strongly constrain the rheology. In particular, we show that the use of a variable or a constant viscosity does not change significantly the results provided that these viscosities are of the same order. However, only a fine tuning of the constant viscosity (eta = 1 Pa s) makes it possible to predict the slow propagation phase observed experimentally at large slopes. Finally, we observed that small-scale instabilities develop when refining the mesh (also called ill-posed behavior, characterized in the work of Barker et al. ["Well-posed and ill-posed behaviour of the mu(I)-rheology for granular flow," J. Fluid Mech. 779, 794-818 (2015)] and in the present work) associated with the mechanical model. The velocity field becomes stratified and the bands of high velocity gradient appear. These model instabilities are not avoided by using variable viscosity models such as the mu(I) rheology. However we show that the velocity range, the static-flowing transition, and the thickness profiles are almost not affected by them. Published by AIP Publishing.

J	Owhadi, H				Owhadi, Houman			Multigrid with Rough Coefficients and Multiresolution Operator Decomposition from Hierarchical Information Games	SIAM REVIEW			English	Article						multigrid; multiresolution; game theory; wavelets; information based complexity; decision theory	FINITE-ELEMENT METHODS; ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS; APPROXIMATE WAVELETS; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; HOMOGENIZATION; INTERPOLATION; BRITTLENESS; MATRIX; QUANTIFICATION; ALGORITHM	We introduce a near-linear complexity (geometric and meshless/algebraic) multigrid/multi-resolution method for PDEs with rough (L-infinity) coefficients with rigorous a priori accuracy and performance estimates. The method is discovered through a decision/game theory formulation of the problems of (1) identifying restriction and interpolation operators, (2) recovering a signal from incomplete measurements based on norm constraints on its image under a linear operator, and (3) gambling on the value of the solution of the PDE based on a hierarchy of nested measurements of its solution or source term. The resulting elementary gambles form a hierarchy of (deterministic) basis functions of H-0(1) (Omega) (gamblets) that (1) are orthogonal across subscales/subbands with respect to the scalar product induced by the energy norm of the PDE, (2) enable sparse compression of the solution space in H-0(1) (Omega), and (3) induce an orthogonal multiresolution operator decomposition. The operating diagram of the multigrid method is that of an inverted pyramid in which gamblets are computed locally (by virtue of their exponential decay) and hierarchically (from fine to coarse scales) and the PDE is decomposed into a hierarchy of independent linear systems with uniformly bounded condition numbers. The resulting algorithm is parallelizable both in space (via localization) and in bandwidth/subscale (subscales can be computed independently from each other). Although the method is deterministic, it has a natural Bayesian interpretation under the measure of probability emerging (as a mixed strategy) from the information game formulation, and multiresolution approximations form a martingale with respect to the filtration induced by the hierarchy of nested measurements.

MOTIVES	In this article we develop a broad generalization of the classical Bost-Connes system, where roots of unity are replaced by an algebraic datum consisting of an abelian group and a semi-group of endomorphisms. Examples include roots of unity, Weil restriction, algebraic numbers, Weil numbers, CM fields, germs, completion ofWeil numbers, etc. Making use of the Tannakian formalism, we categorify these algebraic data. For example, the categorification of roots of unity is given by a limit of orbit categories of Tate motives while the categorification of Weil numbers is given by Grothendieck's category of numerical motives over a finite field. To some of these algebraic data (e.g. roots of unity, algebraic numbers, Weil numbers, etc), we associate also a quantum statistical mechanical system with several remarkable properties, which generalize those of the classical Bost-Connes system. The associated partition function, low temperature Gibbs states, and Galois action on zero-temperature states are then studied in detail. For example, we show that in the particular case of the Weil numbers the partition function and the low temperature Gibbs states can be described as series of polylogarithms.

Long-distance quantum key distribution using concatenated entanglement swapping with practical resources	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						quantum key distribution; entanglement swapping; long-distance quantum communication	CRYPTOGRAPHY	We explain how to share photons between two distant parties using concatenated entanglement swapping and assess performance according to the two-photon visibility as the figure of merit. From this analysis, we readily see the key generation rate and the quantum bit error rate as figures of merit for this scheme applied to quantum key distribution (QKD). Our model accounts for practical limitations, including higher-order photon pair events, dark counts, detector inefficiency, and photon losses. Our analysis shows that compromises are needed among the runtimes for the experiment, the rate of producing photon pairs, and the choice of detector efficiency. From our quantitative results, we observe that concatenated entanglement swapping enables secure QKD over long distances but at key generation rates that are far too low to be useful for large separations. We find that the key generation rates are close to both the Takeoka-Guha-Wilde and the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Banchi bounds.

Ab initio study of the structure and stability of CaMg(CO3)(2) at high pressure	AMERICAN MINERALOGIST			English	Article						Dolomite; ab initio; global carbon cycle; lower mantle; high pressure	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; POST-PEROVSKITE PHASE; DOLOMITE; CARBON; ARAGONITE; CACO3; TRANSITION; MAGNESITE; MGCO3; CO2	Dolomite is one of the major mineral forms in which carbon is subducted into the Earth's mantle. End-member CaMg(CO3)(2) dolomite typically breaks down upon compression into two carbonates at 5-6 GPa in the temperature range of 800-1200 K (Shirasaka et al. 2002). However, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments have shown that dense high-pressure polymorphs of dolomite may be favored over single-cation carbonates (Santillan et al. 2003; Mao et al. 2011; Merlini et al. 2012). Here we compare calculated dolomite structures to experimentally observed phases. Using density functional theory interfaced with a genetic algorithm that predicts crystal structures (USPEX), a monoclinic phase with space group C2/c was found to have lower energy at pressures above 15 GPa than all previously reported dolomite structures. It is possible that this phase is not observed experimentally due to a large activation energy of transition from dolomite I, resulting in the observed second-order phase transition to a metastable dolomite II. Due to the complex energy landscape for candidate high-pressure dolomite structures, several structurally unique metastable polymorphs exist. We calculate the equation of state of a set of lowest-energy dolomite polymorphs with space groups P (1) over bar, P2/c, and C2/c up to 80 GPa. Our results demonstrate a need for calculations and experiments on Fe-Mn bearing high-pressure carbonate phases to extend our understanding of Earth's deep carbon cycle and test whether high-pressure poly morphs of double-cation carbonates represent the main reservoir for carbon storage within downwelling regions of Earth's mantle.

Analyses at Gusev Crater by the Spirit rover and Gale Crater by the Curiosity rover have discovered alkaline basaltic rocks. In this work, multiple methods VSWIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and chemical analyses were used to study a suite of alkaline basalts from San Carlos, Arizona, which have been altered by water in an oxidative, semi-arid environment. As an analog for the weathering of alkaline basaltic rocks on Mars, a suite of rocks visually identified to have different degrees of alteration were characterized to understand the spectral, mineralogical, and chemical trends in alteration as sensed by multiple techniques. Samples with strong 1.9.mu m H2O-related absorptions in VSWIR commonly exhibited absorption bands at 1.4, 2.2, and/or 2.31 mu m, indicating the presence of clay minerals or silica as well as features at 0.5-0.9 mu m indicative of ferric iron oxides. Primary mineralogy for all samples, as determined by point analyses with the microprobe and XRD, consisted of olivine, plagioclase, nepheline, augite, and titanomagnetite. Compositional imaging and spot analyses with the microprobe revealed distinct alteration textures and phases, suggesting weathering pathways involving the oxidation of iron in olivine and primary Fe2+ oxides to form Fe3+ oxides as well as the formation of aluminum phyllosilicates and magnesium phyllosilicates from feldspars and olivines, respectively, while pyroxene remained relatively unaltered. Bivariate plots of major oxides both from bulk-chemical analysis and microprobe measurements also revealed trends in alkali and silica depletion and calcium enrichment, but there was little chemical fractionation in most of the major oxides. The strength of the 1.9 mu m H2O absorption, loss on ignition, and depletion in silica and sodium, correlated with increasing alteration. The data sets provide an analog for understanding possible weathering pathways in martian alkaline basalts and thresholds for the detection of aqueous alteration in multiple data sets.

We investigate whether the SICCI dataset is on a par with other datasets for studying sea ice cover changes in the Southern Ocean. We then examine spatiotemporal variations in sea ice derived from the SICCI dataset over the Southern Ocean, and analyse relationships of sea ice with sea surface temperature (SST). The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the SICCI dataset and the NASA Team dataset, and therefore the former can also be used for studying sea ice changes. Both sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) derived from the SICCI dataset over the Southern Ocean increased slightly from 1992 to 2008, at rates of (17.75 +/- 11.50) x 10(3) and (17.37 +/- 9.51) x 10(3) km(2) yr(-1), respectively. Antarctic sea ice has significant seasonal variations; all seasonally averaged SIE and SIA show an increase, with spring showing the largest positive changing rate. The Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean have positive yearly changing rates in SIE and SIA, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas and western Pacific Ocean have negative yearly changing rates. However, overall sea ice over the Southern Ocean has a slight positive trend, which is the same as the sea ice change pattern derived from the NASA Team dataset. This indicates that the contributions to the change in sea ice over the whole Southern Ocean due to the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and Indian Ocean dominate over those by the Bellingshausen/Amundsen seas and western Pacific Ocean. Further analysis shows that both SIE and SIA are negatively correlated with SST in the Southern Ocean or each of the 5 longitudinal sectors, and sea ice is more sensitive to SST in spring and autumn.

To demonstrate the potential of 28 nm for constructing receivers at these frequencies, a prototype LNA and downconverter chip is demonstrated and measurements of both gain and noise performance are presented. The prototype receiver consumes 191 mW of DC power while providing noise temperatures on the order of 2700 K which demonstrates the potential for use in payload restricted cubesats and other small spacecraft platforms.

Single-Event Effects in a Millimeter-Wave Receiver Front-End Implemented in 90 nm, 300 GHz SiGe HBT Technology	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	53rd IEEE Nuclear and Space Radiation Effects Conference (NSREC)	JUL 11-15, 2016	Portland, OR	IEEE, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, Radiat Effects Comm		Cubesat; extreme environments; millimeterwave; radar; radiometer; receiver; SiGe; silicon-germanium; single-event transient; space missions; two-photon absorption laser; W-band	2-PHOTON ABSORPTION; ION MICROBEAM; LASER-LIGHT; BROAD-BEAM; TRANSIENTS; RF; CIRCUITS; GENERATION; METHODOLOGY; ELECTRONICS	The single-event transient (SET) response of a W-band (75-110 GHz) radar receiver front-end is investigated in this paper. A new technique to facilitate the SET testing of the high frequency transceivers is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The entire radar receiver front-end, including the high frequency signal sources and modulators, were designed and fully integrated in 90 nm 300 GHz SiGe process technology (Global Foundries SiGe 9HP). Two-photon absorption (TPA) laser pulses were utilized to induce transient currents in different devices in various circuit blocks. The study shows how short transient pulses from the high frequency tuned circuits are propagated throughout the receiver and are broadened while passing through low-pass filters present at supply nodes and the low-pass filter following the down-conversion mixer, thus affecting the digital data at the output of the receiver. The proposed methodology allows the study of the effect of SETs on the recovered digital data at the output of the high frequency receivers, thus allowing bit error rate calculations. Comprehensive device and circuit level simulations were also performed, and a close agreement between the measurement results and simulation data was demonstrated. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study of SET on full receiver at millimeter-wave (mmW) frequencies.

From orbital images examined early in the Curiosity mission, the Kimberley region had been identified as a high-priority science target based on its clear stratigraphic relationships in a layered sedimentary sequence that had been exposed by differential erosion. Observations of the stratigraphic sequence at the Kimberley made by Curiosity are consistent with deposition in a prograding, fluvio-deltaic system during the late Noachian to early Hesperian, prior to the existence of most of Mount Sharp. Geochemical and mineralogic analyses suggest that sediment deposition likely took place under cold conditions with relatively low water-to-rock ratios. Based on elevated K2O abundances throughout the Kimberley formation, an alkali feldspar protolith is likely one of several igneous sources from which the sediments were derived. After deposition, the rocks underwent multiple episodes of diagenetic alteration with different aqueous chemistries and redox conditions, as evidenced by the presence of Ca-sulfate veins, Mn-oxide fracture fills, and erosion-resistant nodules. More recently, the Kimberley has been subject to significant aeolian abrasion and removal of sediments to create modern topography that slopes away from Mount Sharp, a process that has continued to the present day.

The surface rupture extended about 120km in a NW-SE direction, west of the Cerro Prieto fault. Here we use geodetic measurements including near- to far-field GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and subpixel offset measurements of radar and optical images to characterize the fault slip during the EMC event. We use dislocation inversion methods and determine an optimal nine-segment fault geometry, as well as a subfault slip distribution from the geodetic measurements. With systematic perturbation of the fault dip angles, randomly removing one geodetic data constraint, or different data combinations, we are able to explore the robustness of the inferred slip distribution along fault strike and depth. The model fitting residuals imply contributions of early postseismic deformation to the InSAR measurements as well as lateral heterogeneity in the crustal elastic structure between the Peninsular Ranges and the Salton Trough. We also find that with incorporation of near-field geodetic data and finer fault patch size, the shallow slip deficit is reduced in the EMC event by reductions in the level of smoothing. These results show that the outcomes of coseismic inversions can vary greatly depending on model parameterization and methodology.

Here we synthesize the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century coral microatoll records into a chronology of interseismic and coseismic vertical deformation. We identify at least five discrete uplift events in about 1597, 1613, 1631, 1658, and 1703 that likely correspond to large megathrust ruptures. This sequence contrasts with the following supercycle culmination, which involved only two large ruptures in 1797 and 1833. Fault slip modeling suggests that together the five cascading ruptures involved failure of the entire Mentawai segment. Interseismic deformation rates also changed after the onset of the rupture sequence, as they did after the 1797 earthquake. We model this change as an altered distribution of fault coupling, presumably triggered by the similar to 1597 rupture. We also analyze the far less continuous microatoll record between A.D. 1 and 1500. While we cannot confidently delineate the extent of any megathrust rupture during that period, all evidence suggests that individual major ruptures involve only part of the Mentawai segment, often overlap below the central Mentawai Islands, often trigger coupling changes, and occur in clusters that cumulatively cover the entire Mentawai segment at the culmination of each supercycle. It is clear that each Mentawai rupture sequence evolves uniquely in terms of the order and grouping of asperities that rupture, suggesting heterogeneities in fault frictional properties at the similar to 100km scale.

Here we have studied the involvement of Pol epsilon in sensing proper progression of DNA replication, using a mutant in DPB2, the gene coding for a non-catalytic subunit of Pol epsilon. Under genotoxic conditions, the dpb2-103 cells progress through S phase faster than wild-type cells. Moreover, the Nrm1-dependent branch of the checkpoint, which regulates the expression of many replication checkpoint genes, is impaired in dpb2-103 cells. Finally, deletion of DDC1 in the dpb2-103 mutant is lethal supporting a model of strand-specific activation of the replication checkpoint. This lethality is suppressed by NRM1 deletion. We postulate that improper activation of the Nrm1-branch may explain inefficient replication checkpoint activation in Pol epsilon mutants.

Cassini UVIS observations of Titan ultraviolet airglow intensity dependence with solar zenith angle	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Titan; airglow; upper atmosphere; ultraviolet		The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (UVIS) observed the airglow (dayglow and nightglow) of Titan over a range of solar zenith angles (SZA) from 14 to 150 degrees on five separate observations obtained between 2008 and 2012. The modeling of the solar cycle normalized UVIS observations indicates that a Chapman layer function provides a satisfactory fit to the intensity of the EUV and FUV airglow molecular emissions of the N-2 Lyman-Birge-Hopfield band system (LBH a1gX1 Sigma g+) the Carroll-Yoshino band system (c41 Sigma u+X1 Sigma g+) and of several atomic multiplets of nitrogen (NI, II) as a function of SZA. This result shows that the strongest contribution to the Titan dayglow occurs by processes (photoelectrons and photodissociation) involving the solar EUV flux rather than magnetospheric particle precipitation that dominates emission excitation in the nightglow.

Spectral analysis of Ahuna Mons from Dawn mission's visible-infrared spectrometer	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ahuna Mons; spectroscopy; DAWN; VIR; Ceres; carbonates	ASTEROID 1 CERES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; MINERALS; VESTA; WATER	Ahuna Mons is the highest mountain on Ceres. A unique complex in terms of size, shape, and morphology, Ahuna is bordered by flanks of the talus around its summit. Recent work by Ruesch et al. () based on Dawn's Framing Camera images shed light on the possible origin of Ahuna Mons. According to Ruesch et al. (2016), Ahuna Mons is formed by a volcanic process involving the ascent of cryomagma and extrusion onto the surface followed by dome development and subsequent spreading. Here we analyzed in detail the composition of Ahuna Mons, using data acquired by the visible and infrared spectrometer aboard Dawn. The spectral analysis reveals a relatively high abundance of carbonates and a nonhomogeneous variation in carbonate composition and abundance along Ahuna's flanks, associated with a lower amount of the Ceres's ubiquitous NH4-phyllosilicates over a large portion of the flanks. The grain size is coarser on the flanks than in the surrounding regions, suggesting the presence of fresher material, also compatible with a larger abundance of carbonates. Thermal variations are seen in Ahuna, supporting the evidence of different compactness of the surface regolith in specific locations. Results of the spectral analysis are consistent with a possible cryovolcanic origin which exposed fresher material that slid down on the flanks.	[Zambon, F.; Raponi, A.; Tosi, F.; De Sanctis, M.

Three-dimensional displacements of a large volcano flank movement during the May 2010 eruptions at Pacaya Volcano, Guatemala	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Pacaya Volcano; three-dimensional (3-D) displacements; pixel offsets; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); volcano instability	SURFACE DEFORMATION; DIKE INTRUSION	Although massive flank failure is fairly common in the evolution of volcanoes, measurements of flank movement indicative of instability are rare. Here 3-D displacements from airborne radar amplitude images derived using an amplitude image pixel offset tracking technique show that the west and southwest flanks of Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala experienced large (similar to 4m), discrete landsliding that was ultimately aborted. Pixel offset tracking improved measurement recovery by nearly 50% over classic interferometric synthetic aperture radar techniques, providing unique measurements at the event. The 3-D displacement field shows that the flank moved coherently downslope along a complex failure surface involving both rotational and along-slope movement. Notably, the lack of continuous movement of the slide in the years leading up to the event emphasizes that active movement should not always be expected at volcanoes for which triggering factors (e.g., magmatic intrusions and eruptions) could precipitate sudden major flank instability.

We performed laboratory experiments, using synthetic foam as a bedrock simulant, to produce self-formed waterfall plunge pools via particle impact abrasion. Plunge pool vertical incision exceeded lateral erosion by approximately tenfold until pools deepened to the point that the supplied sediment could not be evacuated and deposition armored the pool bedrock floor. Lateral erosion of plunge pool sidewalls continued after sediment deposition, but primarily at the downstream pool wall, which might lead to undermining of the plunge pool lip, sediment evacuation, and continued vertical pool floor incision in natural streams. Undercutting of the upstream pool wall was absent, and our results suggest that vertical drilling of successive plunge pools is a more efficient waterfall retreat mechanism than the classic model of headwall undercutting and collapse in homogeneous rock.

Using GRACE to constrain precipitation amount over cold mountainous basins	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						precipitation; satellite; mountain; GRACE; GPCP; cold region	GLOBAL PRECIPITATION; PROJECT; PRODUCTS	Despite the importance for hydrology and climate-change studies, current quantitative knowledge on the amount and distribution of precipitation in mountainous and high-elevation regions is limited due to instrumental and retrieval shortcomings. Here by focusing on two large endorheic basins in High Mountain Asia, we show that satellite gravimetry (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) can be used to provide an independent estimate of monthly accumulated precipitation using mass balance equation. Results showed that the GRACE-based precipitation estimate has the highest agreement with most of the commonly used precipitation products in summer, but it deviates from them in cold months, when the other products are expected to have larger errors. It was found that most of the products capture about or less than 50% of the total precipitation estimated using GRACE in winter. Overall, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) showed better agreement with GRACE estimate than other products. Yet on average GRACE showed similar to 30% more annual precipitation than GPCP in the study basins. In basins of appropriate size with an absence of dense ground measurements, as is a typical case in cold mountainous regions, we find GRACE can be a viable alternative to constrain monthly and seasonal precipitation estimates from other remotely sensed precipitation products that show large bias.

The Lagrangian observations show mean divergence and vorticity values that can exceed 5 times the Coriolis frequency. Values are the largest observed in the field to date and represent an extreme departure from geostrophic dynamics. The study also quantifies errors and biases associated with Lagrangian observations of the underlying velocity strain tensor. The greatest error results from undersampling, even with a large number of drifters. A significant bias comes from inhomogeneous sampling of convergent regions that accumulate drifters within a few hours of deployment. The study demonstrates a Lagrangian sampling paradigm for targeted submesoscale structures over a broad range of scales and presents flow kinematic values associated with vertical velocities O(10)mh(-1) that can have profound implications on ocean biogeochemistry.

At and after the time of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake on 11 March 2011, and the Chile earthquake on 16 September 2015, the spacecraft was performing scans over the Pacific Ocean. Significant (similar to 10% relative to the ambient emission profiles) and coherent nighttime airglow perturbations were observed in the mesosphere following Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broad-band Emission Radiometry limb scans intercepting tsunami-induced atmospheric gravity waves. Simulations of emission variations are consistent with the physical characteristics of the disturbances at the locations of the corresponding SABER scans. Airglow observations and model simulations suggest that atmospheric neutral density and temperature perturbations can lead to the observed amplitude variations and multipeak structures in the emission profiles. This is the first time that airglow emission rate perturbations associated with tsunamis have been detected with space-based measurements.

D.; Pavone, Marco			Design, Control, and Experimentation of Internally-Actuated Rovers for the Exploration of Low-gravity Planetary Bodies	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS			English	Article								This paper discusses the design, control, and experimentation of internally-actuated rovers for the exploration of low-gravity (micro-g to milli-g) planetary bodies, such as asteroids, comets, or small moons. The rover is actuated by spinning three internal flywheels, which allows all subsystems to be packaged in one sealed enclosure and enables the platform to be minimalistic, thereby reducing its cost. By controlling the spin rate of the flywheels, the rover can achieve large surface coverage by attitude-controlled hops, fine mobility by tumbling, and coarse instrument pointing by changing the orientation relative to the ground. We first discuss the dynamics of such rovers, their control, and key design features (e.g., flywheel shape and orientation, geometry of external spikes, and system engineering aspects). We then discuss the design and control of a first-of-a-kind test bed that enables the accurate emulation of a microgravity environment for mobility experiments, which consists of a three-degree-of-freedom gimbal attached to an actively controlled gantry crane. Finally, we present experimental results on the test bed that provide key insights for rover control and validate our theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

On the black hole mass of the gamma-ray emitting narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0323+342	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						quasars: emission lines; quasars: individual: 1H 0323+342; galaxies: Seyfert-infrared: galaxies; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; RADIUS-LUMINOSITY RELATIONSHIP; X-RAY; EMISSION-LINE; HOST-GALAXY; REGION; VARIABILITY; TELESCOPE; SPECTRUM; SAMPLE	Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies have been identified by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope as a rare class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei. The lowest redshift candidate among them is the source 1H 0323+342. Here we present quasi-simultaneous Gemini near-infrared and Keck optical spectroscopy for it, from which we derive a black hole mass based on both the broad Balmer and Paschen emission lines. We supplement these observations with a Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array X-ray spectrum taken about two years earlier, from which we constrain the black hole mass based on the short time-scale spectral variability. Our multiwavelength observations suggest a black hole mass of similar to 2 x 10(7) M-circle dot, which agrees well with previous estimates. We build the spectral energy distribution and show that it is dominated by the thermal and reprocessed emission from the accretion disc rather than the non-thermal jet component. A detailed spectral fitting with the energy-conserving accretion disc model of Done et al. constrains the Eddington ratio to L/L-Edd similar to 0.5 for a (non-rotating) Schwarzschild black hole and to L/L-Edd similar to 1 for a Kerr black hole with dimensionless spin of a* = 0.8. Higher spin values and so higher Eddington ratios are excluded, since they would strongly overpredict the observed soft X-ray flux.	[Landt, H.; Ward, M.

Gravitational torque-driven black hole growth and feedback in cosmological simulations	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; intergalactic medium; quasars: supermassive black holes; cosmology: theory	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS; STAR-FORMATION RATE; MASSIVE MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS; KILOPARSEC-SCALE OUTFLOWS; GALAXY STELLAR MASS; AGN FEEDBACK; QUASAR FEEDBACK; ANGULAR-MOMENTUM; HOST GALAXIES	We investigate black hole-host galaxy scaling relations in cosmological simulations with a self-consistent black hole growth and feedback model. Our sub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum transport by gravitational torques from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic feedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties chosen to match observed nuclear outflows (star formation-driven winds are not included to isolate the effects of black hole feedback). We show that 'quasar mode' feedback can have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium and the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback efficiencies as low as 0.1 per cent relative to the bolometric luminosity. None the less, our simulations indicate that the black hole-host scaling relations are only weakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales, since black hole feedback suppresses the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by a similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the central black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the slope and normalization of the black hole-host correlations. Our results suggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the primary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yun			Modelling galaxy clustering on small scales to tighten constraints on dark energy and modified gravity	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; distance scale; large-scale structure of universe	OSCILLATION SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; BARYON ACOUSTIC-OSCILLATIONS; POWER-SPECTRUM; REDSHIFT; OMEGA; H(Z)	We present a new approach to measuring cosmic expansion history and growth rate of large-scale structure using the anisotropic two-dimensional galaxy correlation function (2DCF) measured from data; it makes use of the empirical modelling of small-scale galaxy clustering derived from numerical simulations by Zheng et al. We validate this method using mock catalogues, before applying it to the analysis of the CMASS sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We find that this method enables accurate and precise measurements of cosmic expansion history and growth rate of large-scale structure. Modelling the 2DCF fully including non-linear effects and redshift space distortions in the scale range of 16-144 h(-1) Mpc, we find H(0.57) r(s)( z(d))/c = 0.0459 +/- 0.0006, DA(0.57)/r(s)( z(d)) = 9.011 +/- 0.073, and f(g)(0.57)sigma(8)(0.57) = 0.476 +/- 0.050, which correspond to precisions of 1.3 per cent, 0.8 per cent, and 10.5 per cent, respectively. We have defined r(s)(z(d)) to be the sound horizon at the drag epoch computed using a simple integral, f(g)(z) as the growth rate at redshift z, and sigma(8)(z) as the matter power spectrum normalization on 8 h(-1) Mpc scale at z. We find that neglecting the small-scale information significantly weakens the constraints on H(z) and D-A(z), and leads to a biased estimate of fg(z). Our results indicate that we can significantly tighten constraints on dark energy and modified gravity by reliably modelling small-scale galaxy clustering.

Assuming models with lognormal scatter about a median relation of the form M-star alpha M-halo(alpha), the preferred log-slope steepens from alpha similar or equal to 1.8 in the limit of zero scatter to alpha similar or equal to 2.6 in the case of 2 dex of scatter in M-star at fixed halo mass. We provide fitting functions for the best-fitting relations as a function of scatter, including cases where the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We show that if the scatter at fixed halo mass is large enough (greater than or similar to 1 dex) and if the median relation is steep enough (alpha greater than or similar to 2), then the ` too-big-to-fail' problem seen in the Local Group can be self-consistently eliminated in about similar to 5-10 per cent of realizations. This scenario requires that the most massive subhaloes host unobservable ultra-faint dwarfs fairly often; we discuss potentially observable signatures of these systems. Finally, we compare our derived constraints to recent high-resolution simulations of dwarf galaxy formation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in M-star at fixed M-halo is large among different authors (similar to 2 dex), individual codes produce relations with much less scatter and usually give relations that would overproduce local galaxy counts.

The Phoenix galaxy as seen by NuSTAR	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY-EMISSION; SEYFERT 2 GALAXIES; XMM-NEWTON; AGN; REFLECTION; VARIABILITY; ABSORPTION; MRK-1210; MISSION	Aims. We study the long-term variability of the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1210 (also known as UGC4203, or the Phoenix galaxy). Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20 yr. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in the context of previously published observations. Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed Compton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first observation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low flux state or was obscured by Compton-thick matter with a reflection-dominated spectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR and exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 yr, we can precisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put constraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus scenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the source must be at least similar to 2 pc, while in the latter the eclipsing cloud may be identified with a water maser-emitting clump.

Physical properties derived from spectral energy distributions	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; galaxies: starburst; galaxies: star formation; radio continuum: galaxies; submillimeter: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; DEEP-FIELD-SOUTH; FAR-INFRARED EMISSION; EVOLUTION SURVEY COSMOS; C II EMISSION; ALMA SURVEY; MU-M; REDSHIFT DISTRIBUTION; RADIO CORRELATION; MOLECULAR GAS	Context. Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) in the early Universe are potential antecedents of the most massive galaxies we see in the present-day Universe. An important step towards quantifying this galactic evolutionary connection is to investigate the fundamental physical properties of SMGs, such as their stellar mass content (M-*) and star formation rate (SFR). Aims. We attempt to characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm selected, flux-limited, and interferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in the COSMOS field. Methods. We used the latest release of the MAGPHYS code to fit the multiwavelength (UV to radio) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 16 of the target SMGs, which lie at redshifts z similar or equal to 1.6-5.3. We also constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio bands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample, AzTEC 1 and AzTEC 3, benefit from previous (CO)-C-12-O-16 line observations, we studied their properties in more detail. Results. The median and 16th84th percentile ranges of M-*, infrared (8-1000 mum) luminosity (LIR), SFR, dust temperature (T-dust), and dust mass (M-dust) were derived to be log(M-*/M circle dot) = 10.96(-0.19)(+ 0.34), log(L-IR/L circle dot) = 12.93+ 0.09-0.19, SFR = 856(-310)(+191) M-circle dot yr(-1), Tdust = 40.6-(+7.5-)(8.1 K), and log(M-dust/M-circle dot) = 9.17(-0.33)(+0.03), respectively. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the galaxy main sequence by more than a factor of 3 and, hence, are starbursts. The 3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared with the present M-* estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are fairly consistent with the masssize relationship of z similar to 2 compact, quiescent galaxies (cQGs). The median radio spectral index is found to be alpha = -0.77(-0.42)(+0.28). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be q = 2.27(-0.13)(+0.27), which is lower than was measured locally (median q = 2.64). The gas-to-dust mass ratio for AzTEC 1 is derived to be delta(gdr) = 90(-19)(+23), while that for AzTEC 3 is 33(-18)(+28). AzTEC 1 is found to have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6(-0.)(+0.2)), while AzTEC 3 appears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two high-z SMGs would be exhausted in only similar to 86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR, respectively. Conclusions. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with those of equally bright SMGs in the ECDFS field (the ALESS SMGs) that are 870 mum selected and followed up by ALMA, suggests that the two populations share fairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. The somewhat higher Ldust for our sources (factor of 1.9(-1.6) (+9.3) on average) can originate in the longer selection wavelength of 1.1 mm. Although the derived median a is consistent with a canonical synchrotron spectral index, some of our SMGs exhibit spectral flattening or steepening, which can be attributed to different cosmic-ray energy gain and loss mechanisms. A hint of negative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of starburstiness and, hence, cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might be more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q values (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific merger or post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results, such as the M(*)3 GHz radio size analysis and comparison with the stellar masses of z similar to 2 cQGs in concert with the star formation properties of AzTEC 1 and 3, support the scenario where z > 3 SMGs evolve into the present day giant, gas-poor ellipticals	[Miettinen, O.; Delvecchio, I.; Smolcic, V.; Novak, M.] Univ Zagreb, Dept Phys, Bijenicka Cesta 32, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Aravena, M.] Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ingn, Nucl Astron, Av Ejercito 441, Santiago, Chile; [Karim, A.] Univ Bonn, Argelander Inst Astron, Hugel 71, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Murphy, E.

Discovery of a low-mass companion inside the debris ring surrounding the F5V star HD 206893	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						brown dwarfs; circumstellar matter; planet-disk interactions; planetary systems	GEMINI PLANET IMAGER; BROWN DWARFS; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; BETA-PICTORIS; GIANT PLANETS; DISK; EXOPLANETS; CORONAGRAPH; PHOTOMETRY; REDUCTION	Aims. Uncovering the ingredients and the architecture of planetary systems is a very active field of research that has fuelled many new theories on giant planet formation, migration, composition, and interaction with the circumstellar environment. We aim at discovering and studying new such systems, to further expand our knowledge of how low-mass companions form and evolve. Methods. We obtained high-contrast H-band images of the circumstellar environment of the F5V star HD 206893, known to host a debris disc never detected in scattered light. These observations are part of the SPHERE High Angular Resolution Debris Disc Survey (SHARDDS) using the InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) installed on VLT/SPHERE. Results. We report the detection of a source with a contrast of 3 : 6 x 10(-5) in the H-band, orbiting at a projected separation of 270 milliarcsec or 10 au, corresponding to a mass in the range 24 to 73 M-Jup for an age of the system in the range 0.2 to 2 Gyr. The detection was confirmed ten months later with VLT /NaCo, ruling out a background object with no proper motion. A faint extended emission compatible with the disc scattered light signal is also observed. Conclusions. The detection of a low-mass companion inside a massive debris disc makes this system an analog of other young planetary systems such as beta Pictoris, HR 8799 or HD 95086 and requires now further characterisation of both components to understand their interactions.

Thermally averaged cyclotron scattering cross sections, mean free photon-path tables, and electron momentum sampling	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						X-rays: binaries; stars: neutron; methods: numerical	STRONG MAGNETIC-FIELDS; LINE FORMATION; COMPTONIZATION; ABSORPTION; RADIATION; EMISSION; GEOMETRY	Context. Electron cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are observed as absorption-like lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars. A significant fraction of the computing time for Monte Carlo simulations of these quantum mechanical features is spent on the calculation of the mean free path for each individual photon before scattering, since it involves a complex numerical integration over the scattering cross section and the (thermal) velocity distribution of the scattering electrons. Aims. We aim to numerically calculate interpolation tables which can be used in CRSF simulations to sample the mean free path of the scattering photon and the momentum of the scattering electron. The tables also contain all the information required for sampling the scattering electron's final spin. Methods. The tables were calculated using an adaptive Simpson integration scheme. The energy and angle grids were refined until a prescribed accuracy is reached. The tables are used by our simulation code to produce artificial CRSF spectra. The electron momenta sampled during these simulations were analyzed and justified using theoretically determined boundaries. Results. We present a complete set of tables suited for mean free path calculations of Monte Carlo simulations of the cyclotron scattering process for conditions expected in typical X-ray pulsar accretion columns (0.01 <= B/B-crit <= 0.12, where B-crit = 4.413 x 10(13) G, and 3 keV <= k(B)T <= 15 keV). The sampling of the tables is chosen such that the results have an estimated relative error of at most 1 = 15 for all points in the grid. The tables are available online (see link in footnote, page 1).

(Sub)millimetre interferometric imaging of a sample of COSMOS/AzTEC submillimetre galaxies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						galaxies: clusters: general; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation; large-scale structure of Universe; submillimeter: galaxies	PROBE WMAP OBSERVATIONS; AZTEC MILLIMETER SURVEY; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; POINT-SOURCE CATALOG; DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; WIDE-FIELD SURVEY; C II EMISSION; HIGH-REDSHIFT; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; ELLIPTIC GALAXIES	We investigate the environment of 23 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) drawn from a signal-to-noise (S/N)-limited sample of SMGs originally discovered in the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)/AzTEC 1.1 mm continuum survey of a Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) subfield and then followed up with the Submillimetre Array and Plateau de Bure Interferometer at 890 mu m and 1.3 mm, respectively. These SMGs already have well-defined multiwavelength counterparts and redshifts. We also analyse the environments of four COSMOS SMGs spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshifts z(spec) > 4 : 5, and one at z(spec) = 2 : 49 resulting in a total SMG sample size of 28. We search for overdensities using the COSMOS photometric redshifts based on over 30 UV-NIR photometric measurements including the new UltraVISTA data release 2 and Spitzer/SPLASH data, and reaching an accuracy of sigma(Delta z/(1+z)) = (1 + z) = 0 : 0067 (0 : 0155) at z < 3 : 5 (> 3.5). To identify overdensities we apply the Voronoi tessellation analysis, and estimate the redshift-space overdensity estimator delta(g) as a function of distance from the SMG and/or overdensity centre. We test and validate our approach via simulations, X-ray detected groups or clusters, and spectroscopic verifications using VUDS and zCOSMOS catalogues which show that even with photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field we can e ffi ciently retrieve overdensities out to z approximate to 5. Our results yield that 11 out of 23 (48%) JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm SMGs occupy overdense environments. Considering the entire JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm S = N >= 4 sample and taking the expected fraction of spurious detections into account, this means that 35-61% of the SMGs in the S/N-limited sample occupy overdense environments. We perform an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band using a 32 '' aperture and our SMG positions, and find statistically significant detections. For our z < 2 subsample we find an average flux of (4.0 +/- 0.8) x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2) and a corresponding total mass of M-200 = 2.8 x 10(13) M-circle dot. The z > 2 subsample yields an average flux of (1.3 +/- 0.5) x 10(-16) erg s(-1) cm(-2) and a corresponding total mass of M-200 = 2 x 10(13) M-circle dot. Our results suggest a higher occurrence of SMGs occupying overdense environments at z >= 3 than at z < 3. This may be understood if highly star-forming galaxies can only be formed in the highest peaks of the density field tracing the most massive dark matter haloes at early cosmic epochs, while at later times cosmic structure may have matured su ffi ciently that more modest overdensities correspond to su ffi ciently massive haloes to form SMGs.

VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS): IGM transmission towards galaxies with 2.5 < z < 5.5 and the colour selection of high-redshift galaxies	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						Galaxy: evolution; Galaxy: formation; galaxies: high-redshift; cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe	LYMAN-BREAK GALAXIES; LY-ALPHA FOREST; COSMIC STAR-FORMATION; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; CLUMPY UNIVERSE; QUASAR SPECTRA; EVOLUTION	The observed UV rest-frame spectra of distant galaxies are the result of their intrinsic emission combined with absorption along the line of sight produced by the inter-galactic medium (IGM). Here we analyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Ly alpha) and its dispersion along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5 < z < 5.5 in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We fitted model spectra combined with a range of IGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral fitting algorithm GOSSIP(+). We used these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each galaxy for several redshift slices from z = 2.5 to z = 5.5. We found that the mean IGM transmission defined as Tr(Ly alpha) = e(-tau) (with tau as the HI optical depth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55%, and 46% at redshifts 2.75, 3.22, 3.70, 4.23, and 4.77, respectively. We compared these results to measurements obtained from quasar lines of sight and found that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in excellent agreement with quasar values up to redshift z similar to 4. We found tentative evidence for a higher IGM transmission at z >= 4 compared to results from QSOs, but a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents us from firmly concluding whether the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z > 4 takes a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V) > 0.15. Most importantly, we found a large dispersion of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards distant galaxies with 68% of the distribution within 10 to 17% of the median value in delta z = 0 : 5 bins, similar to what is found on the lines of sight towards QSOs. We demonstrate that taking this broad range of IGM transmission into account is important when selecting high-redshift galaxies based on their colour properties (e.g. LBG or photometric redshift selection) because failing to do so causes a significant incompleteness in selecting high-redshift galaxy populations. We finally discuss the observed IGM properties and speculate that the broad range of observed transmissions might be the result of cosmic variance and clustering along lines of sight. This clearly shows that the sources that cause this extinction need to be more completely modelled.	[Thomas, R.; Le Fevre, O.; Le Brun, V.; Cassata, P.; Lemaux, B. C.; Tasca, L. A.

The number and quality of these detections is limited in part by thermally induced vibrations in the mirrors, which show up as noise in these interferometers. One way to reduce this thermally induced noise is to use low temperature mirrors made of high purity single-crystalline silicon. However, these low temperatures must be achieved without increasing the mechanical vibration of the mirror surface or the vibration of any surface within close proximity to the mirrors. The vibration of either surface can impose a noise inducing phase shift on the light within the interferometer or physically push the mirror through oscillating radiation pressure. This paper proposes a system for the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) to achieve the dual goals of low temperature and low vibration to reduce the thermally induced noise in silicon mirrors. Experimental results are obtained at Stanford University to prove that these dual goals can be realized simultaneously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Realistic 3-D cirri are modeled with the 3DCLOUD code, and top-of-atmosphere radiances are simulated by the 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer (RT) algorithm 3DMCPOL for two (8.65 m and 12.05 m) channels of the Imaging Infrared Radiometer on CALIPSO. At nadir, comparisons of 1-D and 3-D RT show that 3-D radiances are larger than their 1-D counterparts for direct emission but smaller for scattered radiation. For our cirrus cases, 99% of the 3-D total radiance is computed by the third scattering order, which corresponds to 90% of the total computational effort, but larger optical thicknesses need more scattering orders. To radically accelerate the 3-D RT computations (using only few percent of 3-D RT time with a Monte Carlo code), even in the presence of large optical depths, we develop a hybrid model based on exact 3-D direct emission, the first scattering order from 1-D in each homogenized column, and an empirical adjustment linearly dependent on the optical thickness to account for higher scattering orders. Good agreement is found between the hybrid model and the exact 3-D radiances for two very different cirrus models without changing the empirical parameters. We anticipate that a future deterministic implementation of the hybrid model will be fast enough to process multiangle thermal imagery in a practical tomographic reconstruction of 3-D cirrus fields.

Reliability physics behind the QFN state of stress	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							PREDICTED STRESSES; THERMAL-STRESSES	A physically meaningful analytical stress model is developed for the explanation of the reliability physics underlying the relief in the thermally induced interfacial shearing stresses in a typical Quad Flat No-lead (QFN) assembly. The stress relief in a QFN design is, in effect, an implementation of the general concept developed and quantified by the first author about a decade ago of using inhomogeneous bonds for lower thermal stresses in adhesively bonded or soldered assemblies. It is shown also that the maximum stress in the QFN design can be minimized, if the lengths of the peripheral zones are established based on the requirement that the stresses at the ends of the assembly are made equal to the stresses at the ends of its mid-portion. In the carried out numerical example the gain in the relief in the maximum interfacial shearing stress owing to the application of a bond with an elevated compliance is 9.94 %. When the optimized inhomogeneous bond is applied, the gain is 16.87 %. The gain in the stress relief owing to the optimized inhomogeneous bond (with respect to the homogeneous compliant bond) is 10.66 %. The computed interfacial stresses are below the yield stress of the solder material.

Tunable thermal bioswitches for in vivo control of microbial therapeutics	NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; GENE-EXPRESSION; RECOMBINANT PROTEINS; FOCUSED ULTRASOUND; TET REPRESSOR; TISSUE-DAMAGE; E. COLI; TEMPERATURE; MICROORGANISMS	Temperature is a unique input signal that could be used by engineered microbial therapeutics to sense and respond to host conditions or spatially targeted external triggers such as focused ultrasound. To enable these possibilities, we present two families of tunable, orthogonal, temperature-dependent transcriptional repressors providing switch-like control of bacterial " gene expression at thresholds spanning the biomedically relevant range of 32-46 degrees C. We integrate these molecular bioswitches into thermal logic circuits and demonstrate their utility in three in vivo microbial therapy scenarios, including spatially precise activation using focused ultrasound, modulation of activity in response to a host fever, and self-destruction after fecal elimination to prevent environmental escape. This technology provides a critical capability for coupling endogenous or applied thermal signals to cellular function in basic research, biomedical and industrial applications.

Impacts of increasing aridity and wildfires on aerosol loading in the intermountain Western US	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						aridity; wildfires; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; IMPROVE	UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; PROJECTIONS; DROUGHT; CARBON; FIRES; MODEL	Feedbacks between climate warming, land surface aridity, and wildfire-derived aerosols represent a large source of uncertainty in future climate predictions. Here, long-term observations of aerosol optical depth, surface level aerosol loading, fire-area burned, and hydrologic simulations are used to show that regional-scale increases in aridity and resulting wildfires have significantly increased summertime aerosol loading in remote high elevation regions of the Intermountain West of the United States. Surface summertime organic aerosol loading and total aerosol optical depth were both strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with aridity and fire area burned at high elevation sites across major western US mountain ranges. These results demonstrate that surface-level organic aerosol loading is dominated by summertime wildfires at many high elevation sites. This analysis provides new constraints for climate projections on the influence of drought and resulting wildfires on aerosol loading. These empirical observations will help better constrain projected increases in organic aerosol loading with increased fire activity under climate change.	[Hallar, A.

J	Mirocha, J; Furlanetto, SR; Sun, GC				Mirocha, Jordan; Furlanetto, Steven R.; Sun, Guochao			The global 21-cm signal in the context of the high-z galaxy luminosity function	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						galaxies: high-redshift; intergalactic medium; galaxies: luminosity function, mass function; dark ages, reionization, first stars; diffuse radiation	X-RAY BINARIES; STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; 21 CM SIGNAL; PRE-REIONIZATION ERA; DARK-MATTER HALOES; SIMILAR-TO 20; INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM; HIGH-REDSHIFT; ULTRAVIOLET LUMINOSITY; POWER SPECTRUM	We build a new model for the global 21-cm signal that is calibrated to measurements of the high-z galaxy luminosity function (LF) and further tuned to match the Thomson scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background, tau(e). Assuming that the z less than or similar to 8 galaxy population can be smoothly extrapolated to higher redshifts, the recent decline in best-fitting values of tau(e) and the inefficient heating induced by X-ray binaries (the presumptive sources of the high-z X-ray background) imply that the entirety of cosmic reionization and reheating occurs at z less than or similar to 12. In contrast to past global 21-cm models, whose z similar to 20 (nu similar to 70 MHz) absorption features and strong similar to 25 mK emission features were driven largely by the assumption of efficient early star formation and X-ray heating, our new models peak in absorption at. similar to 110 MHz at depths similar to-160 mK and have negligible emission components. Current uncertainties in the faint-end of the LF, binary populations in star-forming galaxies, and UV and X-ray escape fractions introduce similar to 20 MHz (similar to 50 mK) deviations in the trough's frequency (amplitude), while emission signals remain weak (less than or similar to 10 mK) and are confined to nu greater than or similar to 140 MHz. These predictions, which are intentionally conservative, suggest that the detection of a 21-cm absorption minimum at frequencies below similar to 90 MHz and/or emission signals stronger than similar to 10mK at nu less than or similar to 140 MHz would provide strong evidence for ` new' sources at high redshifts, such as Population III stars and their remnants.

We show that the [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio exhibits a significant correlation with lambda(Edd) (R-Pear = -0.44, p-value = 3 x 10(-13), sigma = 0.28 dex), and the correlation is not solely driven by M-BH or L-bol. The observed correlation between [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio and M-BH is stronger than the correlation with L-bol, but both are weaker than the lambda(Edd) correlation. This implies that the large-scale narrow lines of AGN host galaxies carry information about the accretion state of the AGN central engine. We propose that [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha is a useful indicator of Eddington ratio with 0.6 dex of rms scatter, and that it can be used to measure lambda(Edd) and thus M-BH from the measured L-bol, even for high-redshift obscured AGN. We briefly discuss possible physical mechanisms behind this correlation, such as the mass-metallicity relation, X-ray heating, and radiatively driven outflows.

Cluster selection functions for next-generation surveys	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						catalogues; surveys; galaxies: abundances; galaxies: clusters: general; cosmological parameters; large-scale structure of Universe	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; RICHNESS-MASS RELATION; GALAXY CLUSTERS; X-RAY; SCALING RELATIONS; HIGH-REDSHIFT; COSMOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS; PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFTS; OBSERVED GROWTH; FIELD SURVEY	We present the cluster selection function for three of the largest next-generation stage-IV surveys in the optical and infrared: Euclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). To simulate these surveys, we use the realistic mock catalogues introduced in the first paper of this series. We detected galaxy clusters using the Bayesian Cluster Finder in the mock catalogues. We then modelled and calibrated the total cluster stellar mass observable-theoretical mass (M-CL*-M-h) relation using a power-law model, including a possible redshift evolution term. We find a moderate scatter of sigma(MCL*)vertical bar(Mh) of 0.124, 0.135 and 0.136 dex for Euclid-Optimistic, Euclid-Pessimistic and LSST, respectively, comparable to other work over more limited ranges of redshift. Moreover, the three data sets are consistent with negligible evolution with redshift, in agreement with observational and simulation results in the literature. We find that Euclid-Optimistic will be able to detect clusters with >80 per cent completeness and purity down to 8 x 10(13) h(-1) M-circle dot up to z < 1. At higher redshifts, the same completeness and purity are obtained with the larger mass threshold of 2 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot up to z = 2. The Euclid-Pessimistic selection function has a similar shape with similar to 10 per cent higher mass limit. LSST shows similar to 5 per cent higher mass limit than Euclid-Optimistic up to z < 0.7 and increases afterwards, reaching a value of 2 x 10(14) h(-1) M-circle dot at z = 1.4. Similar selection functions with only 80 per cent completeness threshold have also been computed. The complementarity of these results with selection functions for surveys in other bands is discussed.	[Ascaso, B.; Bartlett, J.

CARMA observations of massive Planck-discovered cluster candidates at z greater than or similar to 0.5 associated with WISE overdensities: breaking the size-flux degeneracy	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						cosmology: observations; large-scale structure of Universe; infrared: galaxies; radio continuum: general	SUNYAEV-ZELDOVICH OBSERVATIONS; ARCMINUTE MICROKELVIN IMAGER; X-RAY MEASUREMENTS; GALAXY CLUSTERS; PRESSURE PROFILE; JOINT ANALYSIS; RADIO-SOURCES; HYDROSTATIC EQUILIBRIUM; SCALING RELATIONS; VIRIAL RADIUS	We use a Bayesian software package to analyse CARMA-8 data towards 19 unconfirmed Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-cluster candidates from Rodriguez-Gonzalvez et al. that are associated with significant overdensities in WISE. We use two cluster parameterizations, one based on a (fixed shape) generalized-NFW (gNFW) pressure profile and another on a beta gas density profile (with varying shape parameters) to obtain parameter estimates from the CARMA-8 data for the nine CARMA-8-detected clusters. Results from the beta model show that our cluster candidates exhibit a heterogeneous set of brightness-temperature profiles. Comparison of Planck and CARMA-8 measurements show good agreement in Y-500 and an absence of obvious biases. Applying a Planck prior in Y(500)to the CARMA-8 gNFW results reduces uncertainties in Y-500 and Theta(500) dramatically (by a factor >4), relative to the independent Planck or CARMA-8 measurements. From this combined analysis, we find that our sample is comprised of massive (Y-500 ranging from 3.3(-0.2)(+0.2) to 10(-1.5)(+1.1) x10(-4) arcmin(2), sd=2.2x10(-4)), relatively compact (theta(500) ranging from 2.1(-0.3)(+0.1) to 5.5(-0.8)(+0.2) arcmin, sd=1.0) systems. Spectroscopic Keck/MOSFIRE data confirmed a galaxy member of one of our cluster candidates at z = 0.565. At the preferred photometric redshift of 0.5, we estimate the cluster mass M-500 approximate to 0.8 +/- 0.2 x 10(15) M-circle dot. We here demonstrate a powerful technique to find massive clusters at intermediate (z greater than or similar to 0.5) redshifts using a cross-correlation between Planck and WISE data, with high-resolution CARMA-8 follow-up. We also use the combined capabilities of Planck and CARMA-8 to obtain a dramatic reduction, by a factor of several, in parameter uncertainties.	[Rodriguez-Gonzalvez, C.; Chary, R.

J	Savard, B; Lapointe, S; Teodorczyk, A				Savard, Bruno; Lapointe, Simon; Teodorczyk, Andrzej			Numerical investigation of the effect of pressure on heat release rate in iso-octane premixed turbulent flames under conditions relevant to SI engines	PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE			English	Article						Turbulent premixed flame; High pressure; iso-Octane; Thin reaction zones regime; Spark-ignition engine	HYDROGEN; METHANE; AIR; SIMULATIONS; PROPAGATION; NUMBERS; SCALE	A series of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of iso-octane/air turbulent premixed flames in the thin reaction zones regime have been performed in order to investigate the effect of pressure on heat release rate under conditions relevant to spark-ignition (SI) engines (up to 20 bar and 800 K in the unburnt gas). Chemistry is represented by a reduced kinetics mechanism containing 74 species and 976 reactions (reduced from Caltech-Mech). The effect of pressure has been isolated by fixing the Karlovitz numbers, the Lewis numbers, and the ratio of integral length scale to laminar flame thickness. On one hand, the results suggest that pressure has very limited effect on the mean heat release rate, such that turbulent burning velocity is proportional to the turbulent surface area. In addition, while the chemical pathways are strongly affected by pressure in laminar flames, the global effect of turbulence on these pathways is negligible, independent of pressure. On the other hand, the local distribution of heat release rate was found to be significantly affected by pressure through differential diffusion-chemistry effects.

Rapid decadal convective precipitation increase over Eurasia during the last three decades of the 20th century	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							NORTHERN EURASIA; WATER-VAPOR; CLIMATE; FREQUENCY; TEMPERATURE; EXTREMES; INTENSITY; MODELS; IMPACT; CMIP3	Convective precipitation-localized, short-lived, intense, and sometimes violent-is at the root of challenges associated with observation, simulation, and prediction of precipitation. The understanding of long-term changes in convective precipitation characteristics and their role in precipitation extremes and intensity over extratropical regions are imperative to future water resource management; however, they have been studied very little. We show that annual convective precipitation total has been increasing astonishingly fast, at a rate of 18.4%/degrees C, of which 16% is attributable to an increase in convective precipitation occurrence, and 2.4% is attributable to increased daily intensity based on the 35 years of two (combined) historical data sets of 3-hourly synoptic observations and daily precipitation. We also reveal that annual daily precipitation extreme has been increasing at a rate of about 7.4%/degrees C in convective events only. Concurrently, the overall increase in mean daily precipitation intensity is mostly due to increased convective precipitation, possibly at the expanse of nonconvective precipitation. As a result, transitional seasons are becoming more summer-like as convective becomes the dominant precipitation type that has accompanied higher daily extremes and intensity since the late 1980s. The data also demonstrate that increasing convective precipitation and daily extremes appear to be directly linearly associated with higher atmospheric water vapor accompanying a warming climate over northern Eurasia.

A model porphyrin system was chosen to study the influence of the solvent on lateral hole hopping, which plays a crucial role in the charge-transfer kinetics. We examined the influence of water, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate as solvents. Hole-hopping lifetimes varied by nearly 3 orders of magnitude among solvents, ranging from 3 ns in water to 2800 ns in propylene carbonate, and increased nonlinearly as a function of added acetonitrile in aqueous solvent mixtures. These results elucidate the important roles of solvation, molecular packing dynamics, and lateral charge-transfer mechanisms that have implications for all dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical device designs.

J	Kwok, K; Pellegrino, S				Kwok, Kawai; Pellegrino, Sergio			Micromechanics Models for Viscoelastic Plain-Weave Composite Tape Springs	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article							DEPLOYMENT; BEHAVIOR; CREEP; RELAXATION; ONBOARD	The viscoelastic behavior of polymer composites decreases the deployment force and the postdeployment shape accuracy of composite deployable space structures. This paper presents a viscoelastic model for single-ply cylindrical shells (tape springs) that are deployed after being held folded for a given period of time. The model is derived from a representative unit cell of the composite material, based on the microstructure geometry. Key ingredients are the fiber volume density in the composite tows and the constitutive behavior of the fibers (assumed to be linear elastic and transversely isotropic) and of the matrix (assumed to be linear viscoelastic). Finite-element-based homogenizations at two scales are conducted to obtain the Prony series that characterize the orthotropic behavior of the composite tow, using the measured relaxation modulus of the matrix as an input. A further homogenization leads to the lamina relaxation ABD matrix. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified against the experimentally measured time-dependent compliance of single lamina in either pure tension or pure bending. Finite element simulations of single-ply tape springs based on the proposed model are compared to experimental measurements that were also obtained during this study.

Here we present the results of a 2.4 Ms NuSTAR observing campaign aimed at studying the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We perform spatially resolved spectroscopic analyses of the Ti-44 ejecta, which we use to determine the Doppler shift and thus the three-dimensional (3D) velocities of the 44Ti ejecta. We find an initial Ti-44 mass of (1.54 +/- 0.21) x 10(-4) M-circle dot, which has a present-day average momentum direction of 340 degrees +/- 15 degrees projected onto the plane of the sky (measured clockwise from celestial north) and is tilted by 58 degrees +/- 20 degrees into the plane of the sky away from the observer, roughly opposite to the inferred direction of motion of the central compact object. We find some Ti-44 ejecta that are clearly interior to the reverse shock and some that are clearly exterior to it. Where we observe Ti-44 ejecta exterior to the reverse shock we also see shock-heated iron; however, there are regions where we see iron but do not observe Ti-44. This suggests that the local conditions of the supernova shock during explosive nucleosynthesis varied enough to suppress the production of Ti-44 by at least a factor of two in some regions, even in regions that are assumed to be the result of processes like alpha-rich freezeout that should produce both iron and titanium.

OGLE Collaboration; Spitzer Microlensing Team	OGLE-2015-BLG-0196: GROUND-BASED GRAVITATIONAL MICROLENS PARALLAX CONFIRMED BY SPACE-BASED OBSERVATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						binaries: general; gravitational lensing: micro	SPITZER OBSERVATIONS; GALACTIC BULGE; SATELLITE MASS; OGLE-III; LENS; PHOTOMETRY; DISTANCES; SYSTEMS; PLANET; STARS	In this paper, we present an analysis of the binary gravitational microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0196. The event lasted for almost a year, and the light curve exhibited significant deviations from the lensing model based on the rectilinear lens-source relative motion, enabling us to measure the microlens parallax. The ground-based microlens parallax is confirmed by the data obtained from space-based microlens observations using the Spitzer telescope. By additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the analysis of the resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens are determined up to the twofold degeneracy, u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0, solutions caused by the well-known "ecliptic" degeneracy. It is found that the binary lens is composed of two M dwarf stars with similar masses, M-1 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.50 +/- 0.05M(circle plus)) and M-2 = 0.38 +/- 0.04M(circle plus) (0.55 +/- 0.06M(circle plus)), and the distance to the lens is D-L = 2.77. +/- 0.23 kpc (3.30 +/- 0.29 kpc). Here the physical parameters outside and inside the parentheses are for the u(0) < 0 and u(0) > 0 solutions, respectively.

The existence of these high-mass stars that apparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm, which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming. With the Hubble. Space. Telescope, we observe the seven most isolated massive (> 8 M-circle dot) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large. Magellanic. Cloud. The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other MYSOs, OB associations, and even known giant molecular clouds, they are actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals similar to 100 to several hundred pre-mainsequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions. Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses less than 100 M-circle dot. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with random sampling of the initial mass function. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we find evidence that isolated clusters containing O stars can exist, which in itself is rare.

Although solved routinely in the course of power grid operations, it is known to be strongly NP-hard in general, and weakly NP-hard over tree networks. In this paper, we formulate the optimal power flow problem over tree networks as an inference problem over a tree-structured graphical model where the nodal variables are low-dimensional vectors. We adapt the standard dynamic programming algorithm for inference over a tree-structured graphical model to the OPF problem. Combining this with an interval discretization of the nodal variables, we develop an approximation algorithm for the OPF problem. Further, we use techniques from constraint programming (CP) to perform interval computations and adaptive bound propagation to obtain practically efficient algorithms. Compared to previous algorithms that solve OPF with optimality guarantees using convex relaxations, our approach is able to work for arbitrary tree-structured distribution networks and handle mixed-integer optimization problems. Further, it can be implemented in a distributed message-passing fashion that is scalable and is suitable for "smart grid" applications like control of distributed energy resources. Numerical evaluations on several benchmark networks show that practical OPF problems can be solved effectively using this approach.

Naturally, the bulk properties of a heterogeneous material can be different from those of its constituents. Thus, one needs to determine its overall or effective properties. For some of these properties, like effective elastic modulus, the characterization is well-known, while for other such as effective fracture toughness, it is a matter of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a method to measure the effective fracture toughness. For the method, we apply a time-dependent displacement condition called the surfing boundary condition. This boundary condition leads the crack to propagate steadily macroscopically but in an unconstrained manner microscopically. We then use the grid method, a non-contact full-field displacement measurement technique, to obtain the displacement gradient. With this field, we compute the macroscopic energy release rate via the area J-integral. Finally, we interpret the effective toughness as the peak of the energy release rate. Using this method, we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on effective fracture toughness. We find that the effective toughness can be enhanced due to the heterogeneity. Consequently, engineered heterogeneity may provide a means to improve fracture toughness in solids.

As a consequence, we obtain the following rigidity theorem for p-adic local systems on a connected rigid analytic variety: if the stalk of such a local system at one point, regarded as a p-adic Galois representation, is de Rham in the sense of Fontaine, then the stalk at every point is de Rham. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of the p-adic Simpson correspondence. Finally, we give an application of our results to Shimura varieties.

Here, mean available potential energy (MAPE), a general measure of baroclinicity that is proportional to the square of the Eady growth rate, is used to understand storm-track shifts. It is demonstrated that, in dry atmospheres, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in a storm track is linearly related to the mean available potential energy, relative to a local reference state, and that maxima of the two are generally collocated in latitude. Changes in MAPE with climate are then decomposed into components. It is shown that in simulations of dry atmospheres, changes in the latitude of maximum MAPE are dominated by changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. By contrast, changes in the magnitude of MAPE are primarily determined by changes in static stability and in the depth of the troposphere. Atheory of storm-track shifts may build upon these findings and primarily needs to explain changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. The terminus of the Hadley circulation often shifts in tandem with storm tracks and is hypothesized to play an important role in triggering the storm-track shifts seen in this idealized dry context, especially in simulations where increases only in the convective static stability in the deep tropics suffice to shift storm tracks poleward.

Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy: A Method for Measuring the Dynamic Electromechanical Response of Ferroelectrics	MICRO AND NANOMECHANICS, VOL 5	Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series		English	Proceedings Paper	SEM Annual Conference and Exposition on Experimental and Applied Mechanics	JUN 06-09, 2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Expt Mech		Dynamic mechanical analysis; Electromechanical loading; Ferroelectricity; Lead zirconate titanate; Viscoelasticity	ELECTRIC-FIELD; DEPENDENCE; CONSTANTS	To gain a better understanding of the dynamic response of thermo-electro-mechanically coupled materials, in particular stiffness and mechanical damping, an experimental apparatus and method called Broadband Electromechanical Spectroscopy (BES) has been developed. The motivation for creating BES was to study the behavior of ferroelectric materials (and other electro-active materials) over wide ranges of frequencies of simultaneously-applied electric fields and mechanical stresses under accurate temperature control. By precisely controlling electric fields and mechanical loading, the effect of microstructural changes, in particular domain switching in ferroelectrics, on the material's dynamic mechanical response is measured. Experiments show large increases in mechanical damping during domain switching that can be tuned by appropriate electrical loading. Results obtained using the new capabilities brought by BES can be used to better understand the damping associated with domain wall motion to be able to create ceramic materials with both high stiffness and high damping-an elusive combination of properties in typical engineering materials. The design and use of the apparatus along with results obtained from tests on a particular ferroelectric, viz. lead zirconate titanate, are presented.

Na-exchange of Sn-Beta titrates the neighboring SiOH group in the open Sn site and shifts catalyst selectivity to mannose formed by a 1,2-C-shift reaction. To probe structure/activity relationships in the zeolite, tin-containing silsesquioxanes with (1a) and without (1b) a neighboring SiOH group were recently synthesized and tested. These molecular catalysts are active for glucose conversion, and the presence (absence) of the SiOH favors fructose (mannose) selectivity by intramolecular H(C)-shift reactions. Using density functional theory, we investigated numerous H/C-shift pathways on these tin-silsesquioxane catalysts. On both la and lb, the H-shift reaction occurs through a bidentate binding mode without participation of the SiOH, while the bidentate binding mode is not favored for the C-shift due to steric hindrance. Instead, the C-shift reaction occurs through different concerted reaction pathways, in which an acetylacetonate (acac) ligand interacts with the substrate in the transition state complexes. Favorable H-shift pathways without SiOH participation and acac ligand promotion of the C-shift pathway explain why la produces mannose from C-shift reactions instead of exclusively catalyzing H-shift reactions, as the Sn-Beta open site does.

DISCOVERY OF A REMARKABLY RED PLANETARY-MASS COMPANION TO THE AB DOR MOVING GROUP CANDIDATE 2MASS J22362452+4751425	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planetary systems; planets and satellites: atmospheres; stars: individual (2MASS J22362452+4751425); stars: low-mass	ALL-SKY SURVEY; YOUNG M DWARF; INFRARED TELESCOPE FACILITY; MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS; PECULIAR L DWARFS; X-RAY-EMISSION; BROWN DWARF; EVOLUTIONARY MODELS; ROTATION PERIODS; ULTRACOOL DWARFS	We report the discovery of an extremely red planetary-mass companion to 2MASS J22362452+4751425, a approximate to 0.6 M-circle dot late-K dwarf likely belonging to the similar to 120 Myr AB Doradus moving group. 2M2236+4751 b was identified in multi-epoch NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging at Keck Observatory at a separation of 3".7, or 230 +/- 20 AU in projection at the kinematic distance of 63 +/- 5 pc to its host star. Assuming membership in the AB Dor group, as suggested from its kinematics, the inferred mass of 2M2236+4751 b is 11-14. M-Jup. Follow-up Keck/OSIRIS K-band spectroscopy of the companion reveals strong CO absorption similar to other faint red L dwarfs and lacks signs of methane absorption, despite having an effective temperature of approximate to 900-1200 K. With a (J-K)(MKO) color of 2.69 +/- 0.12 mag, the near-infrared slope of 2M2236+4751 b is redder than all of the HR 8799 planets and instead resembles the approximate to 23 Myr isolated planetary-mass object PSO J318.5-22, implying that similarly thick photospheric clouds can persist in the atmospheres of giant planets at ages beyond 100 Myr. In near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams, 2M2236+4751 b is located at the tip of the red L dwarf sequence and appears to define the "elbow" of the AB Dor substellar isochrone separating low-gravity L dwarfs from the cooler young T dwarf track. 2M2236+4751 b is the reddest substellar companion to a star and will be a valuable benchmark to study the shared atmospheric properties of young low-mass brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.

These are the highest quality spatially resolved reflectance spectra of Europa's surface at 3-4 mu m. The observations spatially resolve Europa's large-scale compositional units at a resolution of several hundred kilometers. The spectra show distinct features and geographic variations associated with known compositional units; in particular, large-scale leading hemisphere chaos shows a characteristic longward shift in peak reflectance near 3.7 mu m compared to icy regions. These observations complement previous spectra of large-scale chaos, and can aid efforts to identify the endogenous non-ice species.	[Fischer, P. D.; Brown, M. E.; Trumbo, S.

SPITZER SECONDARY ECLIPSE DEPTHS WITH MULTIPLE INTRAPIXEL SENSITIVITY CORRECTION METHODS OBSERVATIONS OF WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, AND HAT-P-22b	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						atmospheric effects; methods: numerical; planets and satellites: atmospheres; planets and satellites: detection; techniques: photometric	INFRARED ARRAY CAMERA; M PHASE CURVES; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; GIANT PLANETS; GJ 436; EMISSION; TRANSIT; IRAC	We measure the 4.5 mu m thermal emission of five transiting hot Jupiters, WASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b, and HAT-P-22b using channel 2 of the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Significant intrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer IRAC data require careful correction in order to achieve precision on the order of several hundred parts per million (ppm) for the measurement of exoplanet secondary eclipses. We determine eclipse depths by first correcting the raw data using three independent data reduction methods. The Pixel Gain Map (PMAP), Nearest Neighbors (NNBR), and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) each correct for the intrapixel sensitivity effect in Spitzer photometric time-series observations. The results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish if they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate their ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all three methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and PLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method appears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar centroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the detector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the residuals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR and PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and should be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span equilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000. K and have brightness temperatures that require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is possible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may also be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.

J	Luan, J; Goldreich, P				Luan, Jing; Goldreich, Peter			CLASSIFICATION OF SATELLITE RESONANCES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability	STRONG TIDAL DISSIPATION; MEAN MOTION RESONANCES; URANIAN SATELLITES; SECONDARY RESONANCES; GIANT PLANETS; EVOLUTION; ENCELADUS; MIRANDA; MIMAS; CONSTRAINTS	Several pairs of solar system satellites occupy mean motion resonances (MMRs). We divide these into two groups according to their proximity to exact resonance. Proximity is measured by the existence of a separatrix in phase space. MMRs between Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede, and Enceladus-Dione are too distant from exact resonance for a separatrix to appear. A separatrix is present only in the phase spaces of the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs, and their resonant arguments are the only ones to exhibit substantial librations. Could there be a causal connection between the libration amplitude and the presence of a separatrix? Our suspicions were aroused by Goldreich & Schlichting, who demonstrate that sufficiently deep in a MMR, eccentricity damping could destabilize librations. However, our investigation reveals that libration amplitudes in both the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs are fossils. Although the Mimas-Tethys MMR is overstable, its libration amplitude grows on the tidal damping timescale of Mimas's inclination, which is considerably longer than a Hubble time.

RESULTS FROM THE CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m: TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAXES FOR 151 NEARBY M DWARF SYSTEMS	ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						parallaxes; solar neighborhood; stars: distances; stars: low-mass; stars: statistics	PHOTOMETRIC STANDARD STARS; YR(-1) MOTION SAMPLE; M TELESCOPE PROGRAM; LOW-MASS STARS; SKY SURVEY; ASTROMETRIC COMPANIONS; SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE; MOVING GROUP; COOL DWARFS	We present 160 new trigonometric parallaxes for 151 M dwarf systems from the REsearch Consortium On Nearby Stars (RECONS) group's long-term astrometry/photometry program at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m telescope. Most systems (124 or 82%) are found to lie within 25 pc. The stars have 119 mas yr(-1) <= mu <= 828 mas yr(-1) and 3.85 <= (V - K) <= 8.47. Among these are 58 systems from the SuperCOSMOS-RECONS search, discovered via our proper motion trawls of the SuperCOSMOS digitized archival photographic plates, while the remaining stars were suspected via photometric distance estimates to lie nearby. Sixteen systems were newly discovered via astrometric perturbations to be binaries, many of which are ideal for accurate mass determinations due to their proximity and orbital periods on the order of a decade. A variability analysis of the stars presented, two-thirds of which are new results, shows six of the stars to vary by more than 20 mmag. This effort brings the total number of parallaxes for M dwarf systems measured by RECONS to nearly 500 and increases by 26% the number of southern M dwarf systems with accurate trigonometric parallaxes placing them within 25 pc.

From combined analysis of radial velocities and Kepler light curves, this system is found to be composed of two A-type stars, with masses of M-1 = 1.84 +/- 0.18. M-circle dot, M-2 = 1.73 +/- 0.17 M-circle dot and radii of R-1 = 2.01 +/- 0.09 R-circle dot, R-2 = 1.68 +/- 0.08 R-circle dot for the primary and secondary, respectively. In addition to an eclipse, the binary light curve shows a brightening and dimming near periastron, making this a somewhat rare eclipsing heartbeat star system. After removing the binary light curve model, more than 10 pulsational frequencies are present in the Fourier spectrum of the residuals, and most of them are integer multiples of the orbital frequency. These pulsations are tidally driven, and both the amplitudes and phases are in agreement with predictions from linear tidal theory for l = 2, m = -2 prograde modes.

CHEMISTRY AND KINEMATICS OF THE LATE-FORMING DWARF IRREGULAR GALAXIES LEO A, AQUARIUS, AND SAGITTARIUS DIG	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: abundances; galaxies: dwarf; galaxies: individual (Leo A, DDO 210, Sgr dIG); Local Group; stars: abundances	STAR-FORMATION HISTORY; MULTIELEMENT ABUNDANCE MEASUREMENTS; KECK SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY; CAMERA 2 OBSERVATIONS; RR-LYRAE STARS; LOCAL GROUP; SPHEROIDAL GALAXY; MILKY-WAY; SATELLITE GALAXIES; VELOCITY DISPERSION	We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo. A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy. The three galaxies-but especially Leo. A and Aquarius-share in common delayed star formation histories (SFHs) relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating H I gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark-matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from 4.4(-0.8)(+1.0) (SagDIG) to 9.6(-1.8)(+2.5) (Aquarius). Leo. A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were further along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo. A is inconsistent with a closed or leaky box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was preenriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [alpha/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended SFHs than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived SFHs. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

POST-OUTBURST RADIO OBSERVATIONS OF THE HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD PULSAR PSR J1119-6127	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						ISM: individual objects (G292.2-0.5); ISM: supernova remnants; pulsars: individual (PSR J1119-6127); stars: magnetars; stars: neutron	SUPERNOVA REMNANT G292.2-0.5; YOUNG PULSAR; TELESCOPE; EMISSION; GLITCH; DENSITY; CATALOG	We have carried out high-frequency radio observations of the high magnetic field pulsar PSR. J1119-6127 following its recent X-ray outburst. While initial observations showed no evidence of significant radio emission, subsequent observations detected pulsed emission across a large frequency band. In this Letter, we report on the initial disappearance of the pulsed emission and its prompt reactivation and dramatic evolution over several months of observation. The periodic pulse profile at S-band (2.3 GHz) after reactivation exhibits a multi-component emission structure, while the simultaneous X-band (8.4 GHz) profile shows a single emission peak. Single pulses were also detected at S-band near the main emission peaks. We present measurements of the spectral index across a wide frequency bandwidth, which captures the underlying changes in the radio emission profile of the neutron star. The high-frequency radio detection, unusual emission profile, and observed variability suggest similarities with magnetars, which may independently link the high-energy outbursts to magnetar-like behavior.

Enantioselective, convergent synthesis of the ineleganolide core by a tandem annulation cascade	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							INTRAMOLECULAR HYDROGEN ABSTRACTION; OCEAN SOFT CORAL; COPE REARRANGEMENT; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; ALKYL-HALIDES; RADICAL GENERATION; ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; CYCLIC ENONES; SINULARIA	An enantioselective and diastereoselective approach toward the synthesis of the polycyclic norditerpenoid ineleganolide is disclosed. A palladium-catalyzed enantioselective allylic alkylation is employed to stereoselectively construct the requisite chiral tertiary ether and facilitate the synthesis of a 1,3-cis-cyclopentenediol building block. Careful substrate design enabled the convergent assembly of the ineleganolide [6,7,5,5]-tetracyclic scaffold by a diastereoselective cyclopropanation-Cope rearrangement cascade under unusually mild conditions. Computational evaluation of ground state energies of late-stage synthetic intermediates was used to guide synthetic development and aid in the investigation of the conformational rigidity of these highly constrained and compact polycyclic structures. This work represents the first successful synthesis of the core structure of any member of the furanobutenolide-derived polycyclic norcembranoid diterpene family of natural products. Advanced synthetic manipulations generated a series of natural product-like compounds that were shown to possess selective secretory antagonism of either interleukin-5 or interleukin-17. This bioactivity stands in contrast to the known antileukemic activity of ineleganolide and suggests the norcembranoid natural product core may serve as a useful scaffold for the development of diverse therapeutics.

An analysis of high cloud variability: imprints from the El Nio-Southern Oscillation	CLIMATE DYNAMICS			English	Article						Sea surface temperature; Cloud fraction; Interannual variability; Principal component analysis	OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE SENSITIVITY; DIURNAL CYCLE; CIRCULATION; FEEDBACK; CONVECTION; DATASETS; CMIP5; ISCCP	Using data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), we examine how near-global (60A degrees N-60A degrees S) high cloud fraction varies over time in the past three decades. Our focus is on identifying dominant modes of variability and associated spatial patterns, and how they are related to sea surface temperature. By performing the principal component analysis, we find that the first two principal modes of high cloud distribution show strong imprints of the two types of El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-the canonical ENSO and the ENSO Modoki. Comparisons between ISCCP data and 14 models from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (AMIP5) show that models simulate the spatial pattern and the temporal variations of high cloud fraction associated with the canonical ENSO very well but the magnitudes of the canonical ENSO vary among the models. Furthermore, the multi-model mean of the second principal mode in the AMIP5 simulations appears to capture the temporal behavior of the second mode but individual AMIP5 models show large discrepancies in capturing observed temporal variations. A new metric, defined by the relative variances of the first two principal components, suggests that most of the AMIP5 models overestimate the second principal mode of high clouds.

It is well known that there is a close relation between such an entropy vector and a certain group-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and n of its subgroups; indeed, roughly speaking, knowing the region of all such group-characterizable vectors is equivalent to knowing the region of all entropy vectors. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space of entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention to abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an explanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al. that linear network codes cannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems (since linear network codes come from abelian groups). All abelian group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton inequality. General entropy vectors, however, do not necessarily have this property. It is, therefore, of interest to identify groups that violate the Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian finite groups that yield characterizable vectors, which violate the Ingleton inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group S-5 to be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study of the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to the Ingleton-violating family PGL(2, q) with a prime power q >= 5, i.e., the projective group of 2 x 2 nonsingular matrices with entries in F-q. We further interpret this family of groups, and their subgroups, using the theory of group actions and identify the subgroups as certain stabilizers. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as PGL(n, q) and GL(n, q). The families of groups identified here are therefore good candidates for constructing network codes more powerful than linear network codes, and we discuss some considerations for constructing such group network codes.

An Efficient and Incentive Compatible Mechanism for Wholesale Electricity Markets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Locational marginal pricing (LMP); power networks; Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism; wholesale electricity markets	EQUILIBRIUM CONSTRAINTS; MATHEMATICAL PROGRAM; POWER-SYSTEMS; AUCTIONS; NONCONVEXITIES; COORDINATION; PRICES; ENERGY	Being widely used in many deregulated wholesale electricity markets, the locational marginal pricing (LMP) mechanism is known to achieve social optimality in a competitive market. When profit-maximizing generators act strategically to manipulate prices; however, LMP may lead to high loss of economic efficiency. In this paper, we apply the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to wholesale electricity markets. We show that the VCG mechanism minimizes the total cost at a truth-telling dominant strategy equilibrium. We establish an important comparative result that the VCG mechanism always results in higher per-unit electricity prices than the LMP mechanism under any given set of reported supply curves. Numerical results show that the difference between the per-unit prices resulting from the two mechanisms is negligibly small (about 4%) in the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus test systems. Finally, we apply the VCG mechanism to a day-ahead setting with start-up cost (of conventional generators) and intermittent renewable generation. We show that the VCG mechanism induces the truth-telling behavior of conventional generators in dominant strategies and yields each conventional generator a non-negative expected profit.

Coupled High-Latitude Climate Feedbacks and Their Impact on Atmospheric Heat Transport	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							POLAR AMPLIFICATION; RADIATIVE FEEDBACKS; CIRCULATION; MODEL; SENSITIVITY; OCEAN; CLOUDS; GCM	The response of atmospheric heat transport to anthropogenic warming is determined by the anomalous meridional energy gradient. Feedback analysis offers a characterization of that gradient and hence reveals how uncertainty in physical processes may translate into uncertainty in the circulation response. However, individual feedbacks do not act in isolation. Anomalies associated with one feedback may be compensated by another, as is the case for the positive water vapor and negative lapse rate feedbacks in the tropics. Here a set of idealized experiments are performed in an aquaplanet model to evaluate the coupling between the surface albedo feedback and other feedbacks, including the impact on atmospheric heat transport. In the tropics, the dynamical response manifests as changes in the intensity and structure of the overturning Hadley circulation. Only half of the range of Hadley cell weakening exhibited in these experiments is found to be attributable to imposed, systematic variations in the surface albedo feedback. Changes in extratropical clouds that accompany the albedo changes explain the remaining spread. The feedback-driven circulation changes are compensated by eddy energy flux changes, which reduce the overall spread among experiments. These findings have implications for the efficiency with which the climate system, including tropical circulation and the hydrological cycle, adjusts to high-latitude feedbacks over climate states that range from perennial or seasonal ice to ice-free conditions in the Arctic.

D2H+ was generated in an extended negative glow discharge cell cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. We observed five new THz lines. All the available rotational transition frequencies together with the combination differences derived from the three fundamental bands were subject to least square analysis to determine the molecular constants. New THz measurements are definitely useful for better characterization of spectroscopic properties. The improved molecular constants provide better predictions of other unobserved rotational transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Yu, S.; Pearson, J.

Line parameters for CO2 broadening in the nu(2) band of (HDO)-O-16	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						HDO-CO2 widths; HDO-CO2 shifts; HDO-CO2 calculated line list; Temperature dependence of widths; Off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients; Mars atmosphere	ROBERT-BONAMY FORMALISM; INTERMOLECULAR POTENTIAL PARAMETERS; DIODE-LASER MEASUREMENTS; HALF-WIDTHS; WATER-VAPOR; COLLISIONAL PARAMETERS; SHIFT COEFFICIENTS; H2O LINES; COMBINATION RULES; H2O-CO2 MIXTURES	CO2-rich planetary atmospheres such as those of Mars and Venus require accurate knowledge of CO2 broadened HDO half-width coefficients and their temperature dependence exponents for reliable abundance determination. Although a few calculated line lists have recently been published on HDO-CO2 line shapes and their temperature dependences, laboratory measurements of those parameters are thus far non-existent. In this work, we report the first measurements of CO2-broadened half-width and pressure-shift coefficients and their temperature dependences for over 220 transitions in the nu(2) band. First measurements of self-broadened half-width and self-shift coefficients at room temperature are also obtained for majority of these transitions. In addition, the first experimental determination of collisional line mixing has been reported for 11 transition pairs for HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO systems. These results were obtained by analyzing ten high-resolution spectra of HDO and HDO-CO2 mixtures at various sample temperatures and pressures recorded with the Bruker IFS-125HR Fourier transform spectrometer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Two coolable absorption cells with path lengths of 2038 cm and 20.941 m were used to record the spectra. The various line parameters were retrieved by fitting all ten spectra simultaneously using a multispectrum nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. The HDO transitions in the 1100-4100 cm(-1) range were extracted from the HITRAN2012 database. For the nu(2) and 2 nu(2) -nu(2) bands there were 2245 and 435 transitions, respectively. Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy formalism (MCRB) calculations were made for the half-width coefficients, their temperature dependence and the pressure shift coefficients for the HDO-CO2 and HDO-HDO collision systems. MCRB calculations are compared with the measured values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Devi, V. Malathy; Benner, D.

Two-dimensional radiative transfer for the retrieval of limb emission measurements in the martian atmosphere	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article						2D; Radiative transfer; Limb geometry; Mars; MCS	3-D TOMOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL; MIDDLE-ATMOSPHERE; SOUNDING OBSERVATIONS; IMAGER GLORIA; MARS; SPECTRA; SENSITIVITY; MODEL	The remote sounding of infrared emission from planetary atmospheres using limb-viewing geometry is a powerful technique for deriving vertical profiles of structure and composition on a global scale. Compared with nadir viewing, limb geometry provides enhanced vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to atmospheric constituents. However, standard limb profile retrieval techniques assume spherical symmetry and are vulnerable to biases produced by horizontal gradients in atmospheric parameters. We present a scheme for the correction of horizontal gradients in profile retrievals from limb observations of the martian atmosphere. It characterizes horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, and aerosol extinction along the line-of-sight of a limb view through neighboring measurements, and represents these gradients by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer in the forward model of the retrieval. The scheme is applied to limb emission measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Retrieval simulations using data from numerical models indicate that biases of up to 10 K in the winter polar region, obtained with standard retrievals using spherical symmetry, are reduced to about 2 K in most locations by the retrieval with two-dimensional radiative transfer. Retrievals from Mars atmospheric measurements suggest that the two-dimensional radiative transfer greatly reduces biases in temperature and aerosol opacity caused by observational geometry, predominantly in the polar winter regions.

The resulting fiber displacements are neither uniform nor smooth; rather, displacements localize to form dense fibrous bands that span from one cell to another. It is thought that these bands may be a mechanism by which cells can sense their neighbors, but this hypothesis remains untested, because the mechanism for band formation remains unknown. Using digital volume correlation, we measure the displacements induced by contractile cells embedded in a fibrous matrix. We find that cell-induced displacements propagate over a longer range than predicted by linear elasticity. To explain the long-range propagation of displacements, we consider the effect of buckling of individual matrix fibers, which generates a nonlinear stress-strain relationship. We show that fiber buckling is the mechanism that causes the displacements to propagate over a long range and the bands to form between nearby cells. The results thus show that buckling of individual fibers provides a mechanism by which cells may sense their distant neighbors mechanically.

Thus, results suggest that alloying and grain size refinement not only improved yield strength but also affected the thermomechanical response.

We interpret the observed spectral changes as a combination of an ambipolar Burstein-Moss (BM) shift of the absorption edge due to band-filling under gate control, and-a quantum confined Franz-Keldysh (QCFK) effect, phenomena that have been proposed theoretically to occur for black phosphorus under an applied electric field. Distinct optical responses are observed depending on the flake thickness and starting carrier concentration. Transmission extinction modulation amplitudes of more than two percent are observed, suggesting the potential for use of black phosphorus as an active material in mid-infrared optoelectronic modulator applications.

Gate-Variable Mid-Infrared Optical Transitions in a (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 Topological Insulator	NANO LETTERS			English	Article						Bismuth antimony telluride; topological insulator; tunable optical properties; mid-infrared; Burstein-Moss shift; optical modulator	BLACK PHOSPHORUS; GRAPHENE; PLASMONS; SEMICONDUCTOR; SPECTROSCOPY; TRANSISTORS; FIELD	We report mid-infrared spectroscopy measurements of ultrathin, electrostatically gated (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 topological insulator films in which we observe several percent modulation of transmittance and reflectance as gating shifts the Fermi level. Infrared transmittance measurements of gated films were enabled by use of an epitaxial lift-off method for large-area transfer of topological insulator films from infrared-absorbing SrTiO3 growth substrates to thermal oxidized silicon substrates. We combine these optical experiments with transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to identify the observed spectral modulation as a gate-driven transfer of spectral weight between both bulk and 2D topological surface channels and interband and intraband channels. We develop a model for the complex permittivity of gated (Bi1-xSbx)(2)Te-3 and find a good match to our experimental data. These results open the path for layered topological insulator materials as a new candidate for tunable, ultrathin infrared optics and highlight the possibility of switching topological optoelectronic phenomena between bulk and spin-polarized surface regimes.

They are studied in many fields, but are especially well known in optics on account of the relative ease of their formation and control in optical fibre waveguides(1,2). Besides their many interesting properties, solitons are important to optical continuum generation(3), in mode-locked lasers(4,5), and have been considered as a natural way to convey data over great distances(6). Recently, solitons have been realized in microcavities(7), thereby bringing the power of microfabrication methods to future applications. This work reports a soliton not previously observed in optical systems, the Stokes soliton. The Stokes soliton forms and regenerates by optimizing its Raman interaction in space and time within an optical potential well shared with another soliton. The Stokes and the initial soliton belong to distinct transverse mode families and benefit from a form of soliton trapping that is new to microcavities and soliton lasers in general. The discovery of a new optical soliton can impact work in other areas of photonics, including nonlinear optics and spectroscopy.

Ultra-High-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Human Inner Ear at 11.7 Tesla	OTOLOGY & NEUROTOLOGY			English	Article						11.7 Tesla; Cochlea; Inner ear; MRI; Ultra-high-field MRI; Vestibular labyrinth	VIVO	Objective: To evaluate the ability of ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 11.7 T to visualize membranous structures of the human inner ear. Specimens: Three temporal bones were extracted from cadaveric human heads for use with small-bore UHF-MRI. Intervention: Ex vivo cadaveric temporal bone specimens were imaged using an 11.7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner via T1-and T2-weighted-imaging with and without contrast. Main Outcome Measure: Qualitative visualization of membranous components of the inner ear compared with reports of UHF-MRI at lower field strengths. Results: The membranous anatomy of the inner ear was superbly visualized at 11.7 T. In the cochlea, Reissner's membrane, the scala media, and the basilar membrane were clearly shown on the scan. In the vestibular labyrinth, the wedge-shaped crista ampullaris and the maculae of both the saccule and utricle were visible. Details of the endolymphatic sac and duct were also demonstrated. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this report presents the first images of the ex vivo human inner ear using 11.7 T UHF-MRI, offering near-histologic resolution. Increased field strength may be particularly useful when imaging the delicate membranous anatomy of the inner ear. Further research on the use of UHF-MRI in clinical and research settings could illuminate structural changes associated with inner ear disorders.

In this paper, we present a method to jointly invert for centroid depths with local (distance < 5A degrees) seismic waveforms and regional (distance of 5A degrees-15A degrees) Rayleigh wave amplitude spectra on sparse networks. We use earthquake focal mechanisms and magnitudes retrieved with the Cut-and-Paste (CAP) method to compute synthetic amplitude spectra of fundamental mode Rayleigh wave for a range of depths. Then we grid search to find the optimal depth that minimizes the joint misfit of amplitude spectra and local waveforms. As case studies, we apply this method to the 2008 Wells, Nevada Mw6.0 earthquake and a Mw5.6 outer-rise earthquake to the east of Japan Trench in 2013. Uncertainties estimated with a bootstrap re-sampling approach show that this joint inversion approach constrains centroid depths well, which are also verified by independent teleseismic depth-phase data.

Local and nonlocal continuum modeling of inelastic periodic networks applied to stretching-dominated trusses	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Nonlocal model; Elasticity; Plasticity; Homogenization; Truss	ORDER GRADIENT CONTINUUM; FINITE-ELEMENT; LATTICE STRUCTURES; NONLINEAR ELASTICITY; LARGE DEFORMATIONS; HOMOGENIZATION; METAMATERIALS; MICROLATTICES; FORMULATION; ULTRALIGHT	We present a nonlocal continuum model and its numerical implementation to describe the macroscale response of periodic discrete networks via second-order homogenization. The scale-bridging technique is applied to the specific example of stretching dominated elastic and inelastic periodic truss networks. Experiments on small-scale truss structures have highlighted the importance of nodal connections on the effective stiffness and strength. Therefore, we describe the mechanics of trusses by accounting for the stretching of truss members and the deformation of nodes. For the representative 2D examples of lattices having square and triangular architectures and for example bar and nodal constitutive laws, we show that a simple continuum model based on affinely deforming a representative unit cell is sufficient to reproduce the nonlinear elastic behavior of discrete trusses. By contrast, localization that arises, e.g., from inelastic deformation requires a refined model. This is where the presented nonlocal continuum model is capable of accurately capturing details of localized deformation. We illustrate the performance of the model by comparing the results of example finite element simulations using the continuum constitutive model to discrete lattice calculations with elastic plastic bars. Optimal performance is achieved when the representative unit cell of the continuum model agrees with the actual size of the discrete truss unit cell, which accounts for size effects even in regimes where a separation of scales between finite element size and unit cell size does not strictly apply.

We coin this system the IPAC/iPTF Discovery Engine (or IDE). We review the algorithms used for PSF-matching, image subtraction, detection, photometry, and machine-learned (ML) vetting of extracted transient candidates. We also review the performance of our ML classifier. For a limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in relatively unconfused regions, bogus candidates from processing artifacts and imperfect image subtractions outnumber real transients by; 10:1. This can be considerably higher for image data with inaccurate astrometric and/or PSF-matching solutions. Despite this occasionally high contamination rate, the ML classifier is able to identify real transients with an efficiency (or completeness) of; 97% for a maximum tolerable false-positive rate of 1% when classifying raw candidates. All subtraction-image metrics, source features, ML probability-based real-bogus scores, contextual metadata from other surveys, and possible associations with known Solar System objects are stored in a relational database for retrieval by the various science working groups. We review our efforts in mitigating false-positives and our experience in optimizing the overall system in response to the multitude of science projects underway with iPTF.

However, the destructive nature of harvest sampling that is usually performed for validation of these data is resource intensive and can limit future comparisons by destroying benchmark measurements. We compared aboveground shrub biomass estimates derived from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) with the goal of determining whether TLS data can be used to accurately calibrate ALS estimates of shrub biomass in Arctic tundra. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation calibration of canopy volume against harvested shrub biomass to establish predictive relationships between TLS canopy volume and harvested shrub biomass, and between ALS canopy volume and TLS-derived shrub biomass estimates. TLS produced more accurate predictions of shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.78; root mean square deviation [RMSD] = 102 g) than did ALS, but the accuracy of ALS-derived shrub biomass predictions was the same whether they were calibrated directly against harvest biomass or against TLS-derived estimates of biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 140 g). Our results suggest that once the initial TLS-harvest relationship is known, TLS can provide valid ground reference data for calibration of ALS-derived estimates of shrub biomass without the need for additional destructive harvest.

Crown group Oxyphotobacteria postdate the rise of oxygen	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							GREAT OXIDATION; SNOWBALL EARTH; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; EVOLUTION; GENOME; ORIGIN; LIFE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CYANOBACTERIA; NITROGEN	The rise of oxygen ca. 2.3 billion years ago (Ga) is the most distinct environmental transition in Earth history. This event was enabled by the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis in the ancestors of Cyanobacteria. However, long-standing questions concern the evolutionary timing of this metabolism, with conflicting answers spanning more than one billion years. Recently, knowledge of the Cyanobacteria phylum has expanded with the discovery of non-photosynthetic members, including a closely related sister group termed Melainabacteria, with the known oxygenic phototrophs restricted to a clade recently designated Oxyphotobacteria. By integrating genomic data from the Melainabacteria, cross-calibrated Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses show that crown group Oxyphotobacteria evolved ca. 2.0 billion years ago (Ga), well after the rise of atmospheric dioxygen. We further estimate the divergence between Oxyphotobacteria and Melainabacteria ca. 2.5-2.6 Ga, which-if oxygenic photosynthesis is an evolutionary synapomorphy of the Oxyphotobacteria-marks an upper limit for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that oxygenic photosynthesis evolved relatively close in time to the rise of oxygen.	[Shih, P.

Hopanoids play a role in stress tolerance and nutrient storage in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme	GEOBIOLOGY			English	Article							2-METHYLHOPANOID PRODUCTION; CELLULAR-DIFFERENTIATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; GREEN; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; RESISTANCE; SIGNATURES	Hopanes are abundant in ancient sedimentary rocks at discrete intervals in Earth history, yet interpreting their significance in the geologic record is complicated by our incomplete knowledge of what their progenitors, hopanoids, do in modern cells. To date, few studies have addressed the breadth of diversity of physiological functions of these lipids and whether those functions are conserved across the hopanoid-producing bacterial phyla. Here, we generated mutants in the filamentous cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme, that are unable to make all hopanoids (shc) or 2-methylhopanoids (hpnP). While the absence of hopanoids impedes growth of vegetative cells at high temperature, the shc mutant grows faster at low temperature. This finding is consistent with hopanoids acting as membrane rigidifiers, a function shared by other hopanoid-producing phyla. Apart from impacting fitness under temperature stress, hopanoids are dispensable for vegetative cells under other stress conditions. However, hopanoids are required for stress tolerance in akinetes, a resting survival cell type. While 2-methylated hopanoids do not appear to contribute to any stress phenotype, total hopanoids and to a lesser extent 2-methylhopanoids were found to promote the formation of cyanophycin granules in akinetes. Finally, although hopanoids support symbiotic interactions between Alphaproteobacteria and plants, they do not appear to facilitate symbiosis between N. punctiforme and the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus. Collectively, these findings support interpreting hopanes as general environmental stress biomarkers. If hopanoid-mediated enhancement of nitrogen-rich storage products turns out to be a conserved phenomenon in other organisms, a better understanding of this relationship may help us parse the enrichment of 2-methylhopanes in the rock record during episodes of disrupted nutrient cycling.

We found that simultaneous deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mouse CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes resulted in dysregulated development and proliferation of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). Tet2-Tet3 double-knockout (DKO) iNKT cells displayed pronounced skewing toward the NKT17 lineage, with increased DNA methylation and impaired expression of genes encoding the key lineage-specifying factors T-bet and ThPOK. Transfer of purified Tet2-Tet3 DKO MKT cells into immunocompetent recipient mice resulted in an uncontrolled expansion that was dependent on the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein CD1d, which presents lipid antigens to iNKT cells. Our data indicate that TET proteins regulate MKT cell fate by ensuring their proper development and maturation and by suppressing aberrant proliferation mediated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR).

Discs were processed by high-pressure torsion until saturation in grain refinement. Dynamic hardness testing revealed a gradual increase in strain rate sensitivity up to m approximate to 0.2. High ductility was observed in the ultrafine-grained magnesium including an exceptional elongation of similar to 360% in tension at room temperature and stable deformation in micropillar compression. Grain coarsening and an increase in frequency of grain boundaries with misorientations in the range 15 degrees-45 degrees occurred during deformation in tension. The experimental evidence, when combined with an analysis of the deformation behavior, suggests that grain boundary sliding plays a key role in low strain rate deformation of pure magnesium when the grain sizes are at and below similar to 5 mu m.

The number of small satellite and CubeSat missions has increased significantly in recent years. Compared to traditional larger satellite missions, CubeSats are designed at lower cost and with shorter development cycles. The reliability of CubeSats and small satellites in on-orbit radiation environments needs to be ensured for mission success. In this study, single event effect analysis has been performed for a 6U-Class satellite instrument in low Earth orbit to improve its on-orbit reliability. Critical commercial off-the-shelf parts of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem of a 6U-Class satellite instrument have been tested under heavy-ion radiation at the Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute Radiation Effects Facility. SEE characteristics have been tested and analyzed for analog-to-digital data converters, voltage regulators, and current sensing and voltage monitoring devices. Device-and system-level risk analyses have been performed for the Command and Data Handling electronics based on the results of heavy-ion radiation testing. System-level mitigation techniques have been studied to minimize the effects of SEEs on electronic systems for deployment on 6U-Class satellites in low Earth orbit.

In this paper we compare the radiation environment that the same solar cell would experience in a flat-plate module versus in a parabolic mirror concentrator system. We have observed that the shielding provided by the concentrator system is remarkable. In order to obtain an accurate prediction of the overall shield needed in our concentrator system triple-junction space solar cells have been irradiated on the edge with 350-keV protons at a fluence of 10(12) p(+) cm(-2). A mild degradation of the open circuit voltage was measured (similar to 70 mV).

We propose an ultralight, modular power station, having specific power in the range of 1-10 kW/kg for the photovoltaic (PV) collection subsystem. The building block of the power station is the 'tile,' a self-contained element that performs PV energy collection, conversion to radio frequency (RF), and transmission to earth. To minimize PV mass, we select a 1D, 10-20X parabolic trough concentrator geometry, which provides cooling and radiation shielding for the cells, and which folds flat for deployment. Here, we discuss the design, fabrication, and testing of the initial PV tile prototypes.

The smoothing technique improved the surface roughness of the CFRP surface from similar to 3 mu m root mean square (RMS) for as-cast to similar to 5 nm RMS after smoothing. The surfaces were then coated with metal, which retained the sub-wavelength surface roughness, to produce a high-quality specular reflector. The mirrors were tested in an 11x geometrical concentrator configuration and achieved an optical efficiency of 78% under an AM0 solar simulator. With further development, lightweight CFRP mirrors will enable dramatic improvements in the specific power, power per unit mass, achievable for concentrated photovoltaics in space.

Effects of Electron and Proton Radiation on Perovskite Solar Cells for Space Solar Power Application	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC					We report the effects of high energy electron and proton radiation on perovskite solar cells. For irradiation with 1 MeV electrons, at fluence from 10(12) to 10(16) cm(-2), there are no significant changes in the morphology and the crystal phase in the perovskites, and the perovskite solar cells show only slight degradation in photovoltaic performance and spectral response. The results from Monte Carlo simulations show most of the electrons completely penetrate through all of the layers of solar cells with little scattering. In addition, 50 keV proton radiation with fluence of 10(12) cm(-2) has no significant impact on the open-circuit voltage or short-circuit current, and degrades only the fill factor. We have further found that the fill factor can be restored with a vacuum annealing process. The results suggest that perovskites have superior electron and proton radiation tolerance, and thus hold particular promise for space applications.

Enhanced Light Trapping in Thin Silicon Solar Cells using Effectively Transparent Contacts (ETCs)	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			light trapping; photovoltaic cells; contacts; silicon	HETEROJUNCTION	We report on the light trapping properties of densely spaced microscale triangular cross-section effectively transparent contacts (ETCs). Optical simulations of thin silicon with closely spaced ETCs were performed and the absorption within the silicon was determined. We found that with a metal coverage of 62.5% the short circuit current density would only be decreased by 0.25%. Such low value of parasitic reflection and transmission is obtained due to the excellent reflection properties of silver microstructures. In the interval 700 nm-1100 nm the short circuit current density is even enhanced by around 1 mA/cm2 compared to a structure without any metal contact. This results from nearly loss free in-coupling in combination with internal reflection at the bottom of the metal lines which increases the path length of light.

Micro-optical Tandem Luminescent Solar Concentrator	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			Luminescent solar concentrator; quantum dots; microoptics; Bragg gratings	ENERGY; NANOCRYSTALS	We propose a design for a concentrated photo-voltaic (CPV) module with features that can capture both direct and diffuse sunlight. This approach uses a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) sheet that includes quantum dots, and a tailored optical coating that enhances concentration and delivery of sunlight to the micro-PV cells. In addition, the light not captured by the quantum dots impinges on a tandem solar cell beneath the LSC sheet. The design of the LSC focuses on lowering the number of expensive micro-PV cells needed within the concentrator waveguide, thus reducing system costs while maintaining high efficiency. The design also allows the module to be effective without a tracking system, making it attractive to all PV markets.

The cost and feasibility of future missions to 5-10 AU and beyond would greatly benefit from the availability of high-efficiency solar arrays optimized for low-irradiance low-temperature (LILT) environments. We have therefore set out to develop an advanced-architecture solar cell technology that will produce over 20% more power per unit area at LILT than the current state of practice. This technology will leverage recent advances in bandgap engineering originally developed for 1 AU, such as inverted or upright metamorphic multijunction device architectures. In addition, the new technology will feature a LILT-optimized, radiation-hard design. This paper reports on initial results from JPL's advanced-architecture LILT cell development project, specifically ground-based laboratory measurements of temperature-dependent illuminated current-voltage (LIV) and external quantum efficiency (EQE). Test conditions included irradiances corresponding to Sun distances from 1 AU to 9.5 AU, and junction temperatures between +28 degrees C and -165 degrees C. Through such measurements, multiple advanced architectures have been identified which demonstrate superior performance even prior to completing the design optimization for LILT, at both beginning of life (BOL, pre-radiation) and at end of life (EOL, post le15 1 MeV e(-)/cm(2)). For example, we measured 5.5 AU -140 degrees C average efficiencies of similar to 35% at BOL and similar to 31-33% at EOL for inverted metamorphic four-junction cells from SolAero and upright metamorphic triple-junction cells from Spectrolab. Further efficiency improvements are to be expected in the near future as we investigate, identify and eliminate from the device design those mechanisms that limit the cell performance at LILT.

Thermodynamic Efficiency Limit of Bifacial Solar Cells for Various Spectral Albedos	2017 IEEE 44TH PHOTOVOLTAIC SPECIALIST CONFERENCE (PVSC)	IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 44th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)	JUN 25-30, 2017	Washington, DC			Bifacial Solar Cells; Spectral albedo; Thermodynamic efficiency limit; Shockley-Queisser-Limit	PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES; ANNUAL PERFORMANCE; SILICON; PANEL	We have adapted the Shockley-Queisser radiative flux balance model to investigate the influence of the spectral dependent albedo on the power conversion efficiency of bifacial solar cells. By taking the spectral albedo of the surroundings into account the optimal band gap becomes dependent on the type of ground-reflecting surface. Furthermore, we find that the maximum efficiency depends on the spectral albedo of the surroundings and that optimal cell performance cannot be assessed when only accounting for a spectrally-independent albedo. We predict that the power conversion efficiency for a bifacial silicon solar cell surrounded by green grass is an absolute 0.90% higher than expected from a wavelength independent albedo, and even 1.51% higher for white sand, with the spectral albedo model. Furthermore, we calculated spectral properties of antireflection coatings and we found that commonly used antireflection coatings in silicon solar cells provide good properties in order to accept back-scattered light from surfaces with different spectral albedos.

The study covered particles from spores to fluorescent particles of different sizes as well as a variety of substrate surfaces, including aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, and nitinol. Particles were deposited using aerosol (dry) and droplet (wet) deposition. Results from the previous study show that the CO2 composite spray system is capable of cleaning to sterility for aerosol deposited spores and is capable of cleaning a minimum of a 4-log reduction for droplet deposited spores. This minimum 4-log reduction matches current Planetary Protection dry heat microbial reduction requirements. In this paper we will present new data to further correlate the cleaning efficiency with how contamination was introduced to the surface, the surface roughness, and particle size. Possible causes for such correlations will be discussed.

In the early days of the Space Program, this figure was small, and could be described in bits or maybe even megabits. But now, missions are capable of returning data volumes two or three orders of magnitude larger. For example, Voyager 1 and 2 combined produced a little over 5 Terabits of data in 39 years of operation. In contrast, the Cassini mission, launched two decades after Voyager, produced about one and a half times those data volumes in half the time. NISAR, an Earth Science Mission currently in implementation, plans to produce over 28 Petabits of raw data in just 3 years. This means that NISAR will produce about as many data in 30 days as the combined data production of nearly all planetary missions to date. These increases in capability are a result of technology enhancements in two main areas: telecommunications architecture (both space and ground segments) and data storage technology. This paper describes the progression of these two technologies over the course of more than three decades of space missions and provides additional insight into the design of the end-to-end NISAR Data System Architecture. Trends in the data are briefly explored and compared to Moore's Law which provides only a qualitative model for memory growth but not for data production. In summary, early missions are found to be driven by unrefined processes while later missions, having utilized earlier lessons learned, focus more on improvements to flight and ground capabilities. Data return seems to fall into three categories. First, deep space missions are driven by the large distances that limit data return to the Earth. Next, the orbiter infrastructure around Mars helps these missions generate more data than other deep space spacecraft. Finally, near-Earth missions have the greatest capabilities for the studied metrics due to their close proximity to Earth and the ground network availability.	[Jasper, Lee E.

During this time, regular astrometric measurements of Cassini's sky position have been made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). These are high precision differential measurements that determine the position of Cassini with respect to angularly nearby extragalactic radio sources. Differential, narrow-angle astrometry reduces many error sources, particularly those associated with signal propagation effects in the ionosphere and troposphere. The background radio sources positions are tied to the inertial International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) by other international VLBI observations. Thus, we obtain a series of ICRF positions for Cassini, which can be combined with spacecraft orbit solutions from Deep Space Network doppler tracking to get ICRF positions for the center of mass of the Saturn system. These positions have typical accuracies at the nano-radian level. For some epochs uncertainties in the background source positions are a major component of the total error, but these positions are being constantly improved as additional VLBI observations are incorporated into radio source catalogs. The planetary ephemeris group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory uses our position measurements to fit improved orbital solutions for Saturn. As a result the orientation of the plane of Saturn's orbit is now known to approximately 0.25 milli-arcseconds (1.25 nrad), nearly an order of magnitude improvement over its pre-VLBA uncertainty. We will continue this observing program until the end of the Cassini mission in late 2017. By that time we will have covered about 1/3 of Saturn's orbital longitude range. Future improvements to this technique will include the use of higher spacecraft downlink frequencies (Ka band instead of X band) and higher ground array sensitivity to permit the use of weaker but angularly closer reference sources. In addition, the continuing international campaigns to enhance the accuracy of radio source catalogs will be extended to weaker sources, improving their ties to the ICRF.

Each team submitted a Mission Concept Study to NASA in August 2016, and in January of 2017 NASA selected Psyche and a second mission for flight. This paper describes Psyche, a unique investigation of a metal world, which is the only one of the original five mission concepts studied in detail to propose the use of Electric Propulsion (EP) to accomplish its mission objectives. Psyche will harness commercially developed EP and space power systems with strong system-level heritage to accomplish a deep space NASA science mission at comparatively low technical-risk and cost-risk. This paper describes the Psyche mission concept and the unique Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) architecture that allows the use of SSL's commercial SPT-140 Hall thruster propulsion system at solar distances of up to 3.3 AU with only minimal modifications. Building on previous work analyzing SEP systems for Discovery-class missions, this paper describes the heritage, design, and testing which have been conducted on the power and propulsion systems to develop the Psyche mission, addresses the differences between GEO and deep-space environments, and describes actions taken to ensure that GEO heritage systems can be operated reliably in deep-space.

This method was developed for the Mars Exploration Rovers mission's surface operations to aid in determining orbiter visibility periods for downlink data, and is now being considered for all Mars surface missions and for a variety of applications. Starting with images received from Mars rovers or landers, the horizon pixel location is found by (1) obtaining the gradient images using the Sobel operator, (2) calculating the preliminary horizon locations by optimizing the maximum difference between sky and ground regions in the gradient domain, and (3) applying a multi-variable thresholding method. The results are analyzed using a variety of images from the Mars rovers, as an example one dataset's results were categorized as 94.2% Good, 4.11% Okay, and 1.65% Poor. The pixel location corresponding to the found horizon in an image is converted to azimuth and elevation values using the camera model. The elevation of the terrain surrounding the rover or lander directly affects the duration orbiters are visible for downlink data volume, and when the sun is visible for image quality or solar energy consumption. Having an automated process to detect the elevation of the terrain allows the operation team to better predict the outcome of the plan, reducing heath and safety risks and allowing new operational limits to be defined.

A three-mission campaign concept is currently being investigated. The Mars 2020 rover mission is intended to core and collect samples. These samples will be sealed in tubes and left on the surface for potential return to Earth. In the current MSR campaign concept, a Sample Retrieval and Launch (SRL) mission would collect the sample tubes left by the Mars 2020 rover and load them into a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) to be launched into orbit. The third mission concept involves a spacecraft capturing the samples in Martian orbit and returning them to Earth. This paper focuses on the SRL mission concept to collect the sample tubes, addressing the problem of autonomously detecting, localizing, and grasping sample tubes deposited on the Martian surface. We employ two approaches: The first one is context-based. It would use a high precision map computed from images captured during tube release, to locate the tubes without directly observing them. The second approach directly detects the sample tubes visually and estimates their 6-DoF pose onboard from dense stereo data.

In particular, space-based radio interferometers can detect signals in frequency ranges that are absorbed by Earth's ionosphere or atmosphere. Furthermore, such formation missions are now feasible under constrained cost caps due to the growing availability of SmallSat components with spaceflight heritage that are compatible the CubeSat form-factor. Accordingly, we analyze a mission concept operating multiple SmallSats in a passive cluster to establish a space-based interferometer. The goal of this array is to reconstruct radio emissions associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) from the Sun, giving us insight into the particle acceleration occurring during these events. This low-cost mission concept presents a number of unique challenges in regards to mission design and navigation, particularly the configuration of the spacecraft to optimize science return and the reconstruction of precise spacecraft-spacecraft separation values. After providing a brief overview of the mission concept, this paper presents several key features of the mission design and orbit determination strategy that enable this potential heliophysics mission.

A Framework for Writing Measurement Requirements and its Application to the Planned Europa Mission	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Science-engineering communication is critical to the success of any science-driven mission. The process of building this understanding relies on a shared language for communicating science needs and engineering results, which can be particularly difficult on large space-science missions where many different institutions contribute to the science team. The Science Traceability Matrix can be used to formalize this communication pathway, but it has limited use in the development of the science requirements flowdown, and varies in format, scope and content from mission to mission. There are many guidelines on developing well-constructed requirements in general, but very little is published on how to actually write these science-driven requirements in a systematic way. This paper discusses the measurement-domain science traceability and alignment framework, or M-STAF, which was developed to help frame the conversation between scientists and engineers in the development of measurement requirements. The M-STAF provides a common language that can be used to ensure consistency across instruments, completeness in the coverage of the requirements, and traceability of the engineering work to the science objectives of the project. This work discusses the framework in the context of other communication tools and its implementation on a flight project. The general framework is presented through the lens of its potential application on the planned Europa Mission.

During this stage of human Mars exploration, it would be necessary to provision the crews with equipment and supplies both before and during their missions. In this paper, we study the use of 150 kW reusable SEP tugs as a means to deliver elements both to orbit and to the surface. The SEP tugs would make use of technology currently being developed for the proposed Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM). They would also be used to deliver food and supplies to sustain the crews similar to resupply missions for the International Space Station. The SEP tugs envisioned would be staged at a quasi-stable Lunar Near Rectilinear Orbit (NRO). The tugs would then mate with cargo vessels and xenon propellant being delivered by an SLS launch vehicle and continue on to Mars orbit where the cargo is delivered and the SEP tug returns to NRO to repeat the process. It was found that it is more efficient to deliver surface cargo via direct launch and entry versus using the tug cycler. Thousands of optimized low-thrust trajectories were simulated in order to create "Bacon plots" (like porkchop plots, but for low thrust transfers) in order to map out potential trajectories for dates from 2039 to 2052. This study maps out the buildup of a surface outpost as well as the necessary orbital and surface resupply launches in order to maintain it. In the steady state, a cadence of 9 cargo launches is required every 4 years to sustain the human outpost.

In this paper, we presented the first calorimetry and timing performance measurement of Cadmium-Telluride (CdTe) as the active material of sampling calorimeter, using 2 GeV to 200 GeV electron beam from CERN beam lines. A good energy performance is achieved due to the better sensitivity of CdTe to X ray photons in the secondary shower than other semi-conducting sensors such as silicon. The timing resolution of the tested CdTe sensor is measured to be down to 21 ps under the best conditions.

Each crystal has a dimension of 34x34x200 mm(3), and is readout by a large area SiPM array. A series of technical specifications on mechanical and optical parameters was defined according to the calorimeter physics requirements. Pre-production CsI crystals were procured from three firms: Amcrys, Saint-Gobain and SIC. We report the quality assurance on crystal's scintillation properties and their radiation hardness against ionization dose and neutrons. With a fast decay time of about 30 ns and a light output of more than 100 p.e./MeV measured by a bi-alkali PMT, un-doped CsI crystals provide a cost-effective solution for Mu2e.

For very large distributed datasets, this slows down the analytics process, and for extremely large datasets it is often impractical to download such massive volumes due to bandwidth limitations. In such cases, data scientists need to be provided explicit access to the remote servers hosting the datasets, and possess detailed knowledge of the server infrastructure and environments, in order to send their analytics packages to the data owner. This alternative poses considerable challenges and has not been adequately addressed to date. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to addressing this challenge called Virtual Information Fabric Infrastructure (VIFI) which seamlessly allows users to conduct analytics-in-place by distributing analytics to the distributed repositories without moving the underlying datasets to a common location. By allowing automated analytics scripts to be sent to the data and orchestration of distributed infrastructure, VIFI allows users to conduct, execute and coordinate complex analytics activities in-place with the data on multiple data repositories. VIFI uses Docker containerization technology along with open-source workflow tool NIFI to achieve automated orchestration and distributed analytics without requiring users to posses detailed knowledge of the distributed repositories and their underlying infrastructure. We demonstrate and evaluate VIFI on a Earth Science use-case for evaluation of precipitation over the Great Plains involving analytics on massive distributed data repositories.

This new paradigm calls for a framework to manage a large set of distributively owned heterogeneous resources, with the fundamental objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy and privacy of resource owners. In this paper, we design Unicorn, the first unified framework that accomplishes this goal. The foundation of Unicorn is RSDP, an autonomous, privacy-preserving resource discovery and representation system to provide accurate resource availability information. Its core is a novel abstraction called resource vector abstraction which describes the resource availability in a set of linear constraints. In addition, Unicorn also provides a series of advanced solutions to support automatic, efficient management of resource dynamics on both supply and demand sides, including an automatic workflow transformer, an intelligent resource demand estimator and an efficient, scalable multi-resource orchestrator. Being the first unified framework for this new paradigm, Unicorn plays a fundamental role in next-generation data-intensive collaborative computing systems.

Photometric Redshift Estimation: An Active Learning Approach	2017 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 27-DEC 01, 2017	Honolulu, HI	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			DOMAIN ADAPTATION; DISTANCE	A long-lasting problem in astronomy is the accurate estimation of galaxy distances based solely on the information contained in photometric filters. Due to observational selection effects, the spectroscopic (source) sample lacks coverage throughout the feature space (e.g. colors and magnitudes) compared to the photometric (target) sample; this results in a clear mismatch in terms of photometric measurement distributions. We propose a solution to this problem based on active learning, a machine learning technique where a sampling strategy enables us to select the most informative instances to build a predictive model; specifically, we use active learning following a Query by Committee approach. We show that by making wisely selected queries in the target domain, we are able to increase our predictive performance significantly. We also show how a relatively small number of queries (spectroscopic follow-up measurements) suffices to improve the performance of photometric redshift estimators significantly.

Energized electrons excite Langmuir waves, which convert into radio emission at the local plasma frequency, with the most intense acceleration thought to occur within 20 R-S. The capability of ground-based radio arrays to track this radio emission is limited by ionospheric absorption (nu greater than or similar to 15 MHz) to altitudes less than about 3R(S). The state of the art for tracking such emission from space is defined by single antennas (Wind/WAVES, Stereo/SWAVES), in which the tracking is accomplished by assuming a frequency-to-density mapping; there has been some success in triangulating the emission between the spacecraft, but considerable uncertainties remain. The Sun Radio Imaging Space Experiment (SunRISE) mission concept would be a constellation of small spacecraft operating as an interferometer designed to localize and track radio emissions in the inner heliosphere. Each spacecraft would carry a receiving system for observations below 25 MHz, and SunRISE would image CMEs more than a few solar radii from the Sun.	[Lazio, T.

We find that significant network structure exists distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high-latitudes (cusp/ionospheric footpoints of magnetospheric boundary layers, polar cap, and auroral zone), and that these features vary with IMF clock angle.

LIGO Sci Collaboration; LIGO Sci Collaboration; VIRGO Collaboration	The basic physics of the binary black hole merger GW150914	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK			English	Article							GRAVITATIONAL-RADIATION; MAXIMUM MASS; PULSAR; WAVES	The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere, in showing that the signal was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The black holes were each of approximately 35M(circle dot), still orbited each other as close as similar to 350 km apart and subsequently merged to form a single black hole. Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in gravitational waves.	[Abbott, B.

It presents the first algorithm that uses optimal storage and provably computes a low-rank approximation of a solution. In particular, when all solutions have low rank, the algorithm converges to a solution. This algorithm, SketchyCGM, modifies a standard convex optimization scheme, the conditional gradient method, to store only a small randomized sketch of the matrix variable. After the optimization terminates, the algorithm extracts a low-rank approximation of the solution from the sketch. In contrast to non-convex heuristics, the guarantees for SketchyCGM do not rely on statistical models for the problem data. Numerical work demonstrates the benefits of SketchyCGM over heuristics.

Using example of hydrology, we emphasize how meta-data and ontologies are crucial in such an undertaking. Using the infrastructure being designed for EarthCube - the Virtual Observatory for the earth sciences - we discuss essential steps for better transfer of tools and techniques in the future e.g. domain adaptation. Finally we point out that it is never a one-way process and there is enough for astroinformatics to learn from geoinformatics as well.	[Mahabal, Ashish A.; Djorgovski, S.

Dealing with the size and complexity of this requires new techniques and methodologies. Quasars are an ideal work set for developing and applying these: they vary in a detectable but not easily quantifiable manner whose physical origins are poorly understood. In this paper, we will review how quasars are identified by their variability and how these techniques can be improved, what physical insights into their variability can be gained from studying extreme examples of variability, and what approaches can be taken to increase the number of quasars known. These will demonstrate how astroinformatics is essential to discovering and understanding this important population.	[Graham, Matthew J.; Djorgovski, S.

Updates to the infrastructure and data integration techniques are enabling more than a 10-fold expansion; NED will soon contain over a billion objects with their fundamental attributes fused across the spectrum via cross-identifications among the largest sky surveys (e.g., GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, AllWISE, EMU), and over 100,000 smaller but scientifically important catalogs and journal articles. The recent discovery of super-luminous spiral galaxies exemplifies the opportunities for data mining and science discovery directly from NED's rich data synthesis. Enhancements to the user interface, including new APIs, VO protocols, and queries involving derived physical quantities, are opening new pathways for panchromatic studies of large galaxy samples. Examples are shown of graphics characterizing the content of NED, as well as initial steps in exploring the database via interactive statistical visualizations.

We compare measured fluxes between instrument pairs in two energy bands, 1-5 keV and 3-7 keV, and calculate an average cross-normalization constant for each energy range. We review known cross-calibration features and provide a series of tables and figures to be used for evaluating cross-normalization constants obtained from other observations with the above mentioned observatories.

MiNDSTEp differential photometry of the gravitationally lensed quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE0047-1756: microlensing and a new time delay	ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS			English	Article						gravitational lensing: micro; techniques: photometric; quasars: general	HAMBURG ESO SURVEY; BRIGHT QSOS; LENSING EXPERIMENT; IMAGE SUBTRACTION; COLOR VARIATIONS; HE 0435-1223; COSMOGRAIL; REDSHIFT; GALAXY; FLUX	Aims. We present V and R photometry of the gravitationally lensed quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE 0047-1756. The data were taken by the MiNDSTEp collaboration with the 1.54 m Danish telescope at the ESO La Silla observatory from 2008 to 2012. Methods. Differential photometry has been carried out using the image subtraction method as implemented in the HOTPAnTS package, additionally using GALFIT for quasar photometry. Results. The quasar WFI 2033-4723 showed brightness variations of order 0.5 mag in V and R during the campaign. The two lensed components of quasar HE 0047-1756 varied by 0.2-0.3 mag within five years. We provide, for the first time, an estimate of the time delay of component B with respect to A of Delta t = (7.6 +/- 1.8) days for this object. We also find evidence for a secular evolution of the magnitude difference between components A and B in both filters, which we explain as due to a long-duration microlensing event. Finally we find that both quasars WFI 2033-4723 and HE 0047-1756 become bluer when brighter, which is consistent with previous studies.	[Giannini, E.; Schmidt, R.

VERITAS Collaboration; MAGIC Collaboration	A SEARCH FOR SPECTRAL HYSTERESIS AND ENERGY-DEPENDENT TIME LAGS FROM X-RAY AND TeV GAMMA-RAY OBSERVATIONS OF Mrk 421	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						BL Lacertae objects: individual (Markarian 421); galaxies: active; gamma rays: general; radiation mechanisms: non-thermal	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; XMM-NEWTON; MULTIWAVELENGTH OBSERVATIONS; VARIABILITY; EMISSION; MARKARIAN-421; TELESCOPE; PHOTONS; BLAZARS; FLARE	Blazars are variable emitters across all wavelengths over a wide range of timescales, from months down to minutes. It is therefore essential to observe blazars simultaneously at different wavelengths, especially in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, where the broadband spectral energy distributions usually peak. In this work, we report on three " target-of-opportunity" observations of Mrk 421, one of the brightest TeV blazars, triggered by a strong flaring event at TeV energies in 2014. These observations feature long, continuous, and simultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering the X-ray and optical/ultraviolet bands) and VERITAS (covering the TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous observations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-Large Area Telescope) and a number of radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant X-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in the X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the simultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time delays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source properties (e. g., the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the magnetic field, and related timescales). The observed broadband spectra are consistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We find that the power spectral density distribution at greater than or similar to 4 x 10(-4) Hz from the X-ray data can be described by a power-law model with an index value between 1.2 and 1.8, and do not find evidence for a steepening of the power spectral index (often associated with a characteristic length scale) compared to the previously reported values at lower frequencies.

SPECTRAL CHANGES IN THE HYPERLUMINOUS PULSAR IN NGC 5907 AS A FUNCTION OF SUPER-ORBITAL PHASE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; pulsars: individual (NGC 5907 ULX1); X-rays: binaries	X-RAY SOURCE; XMM-NEWTON OBSERVATIONS; PHOTON IMAGING CAMERA; BLACK-HOLES; BROAD-BAND; ULTRALUMINOUS STATE; ACCRETION DISKS; NEUTRON-STARS; GX 339-4; 1313 X-1	We present broadband, multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy of the pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 5907. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data from 2014 are best described by a multicolor blackbody model with a temperature gradient as a function of accretion disk radius significantly flatter than expected for a standard thin accretion disk (T(r) proportional to r(-p), with p = 0.608(-0.012)(+0.014)). Additionally, we detect a hard power-law tail at energies above 10 keV, which we interpret as being due to Comptonization. We compare this observation to archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR data from 2003, 2012, and 2013, and investigate possible spectral changes as a function of phase over the 78-day. super-orbital period of this source. We find that observations taken around phases 0.3-0.4 show very similar temperature profiles, even though the observed flux varies significantly, while one observation taken around phase 0 has a significantly steeper profile. We discuss these findings in light of the recent discovery that the compact object is a neutron star and show that precession of the accretion disk or the neutron star can self-consistently explain most observed phenomena.

DETECTION OF VERY LOW-FREQUENCY, QUASI-PERIODIC OSCILLATIONS IN THE 2015 OUTBURST OF V404 CYGNI	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						methods: statistical; relativistic processes; stars: black holes; X-rays: binaries	X-RAY BINARIES; ADVECTION-DOMINATED ACCRETION; LENS-THIRRING PRECESSION; LONG-TERM VARIABILITY; POWER SPECTRAL COMPONENTS; MICROQUASAR GRO J1655-40; BLACK-HOLE TRANSIENTS; NOVA XTE J1550-564; TIMING BEHAVIOR; GS 2023+338	In 2015 June, the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) V404 Cygni went into outburst for the first time since 1989. Here, we present a comprehensive search for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of V404 Cygni during its recent outburst, utilizing data from six instruments on board five different X-ray missions: Swift/XRT, Fermi/GBM, Chandra/ACIS, INTEGRAL's IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X, and NuSTAR. We report the detection of a QPO at 18 mHz simultaneously with both Fermi/GBM and Swift/XRT, another example of a rare but slowly growing new class of mHz-QPOs in BHXRBs linked to sources with a high orbital inclination. Additionally, we find a duo of QPOs in a Chandra/ACIS observation at 73 mHz and 1.03 Hz, as well as a QPO at 136 mHz in a single Swift/XRT observation that can be interpreted as standard Type-C QPOs. Aside from the detected QPOs, there is significant structure in the broadband power, with a strong feature observable in the Chandra observations between 0.1 and 1 Hz. We discuss our results in the context of current models for QPO formation.

Existing algorithms are either heuristics with no guarantees, or scale poorly (with exponential run time in terms of the number of available tests). Moreover, these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is often not the case in practice. We propose a sampling-based online learning framework to address the above issues. First, assuming the distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm which learns the parameters progressively via posterior sampling in an online fashion. We further establish a rigorous bound on the expected regret. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world interactive troubleshooting application, and show that one can efficiently make high-quality decisions with low cost.

In this paper, we study the problem of multi-dueling bandits with dependent arms, which extends the original dueling bandits setting by simultaneously dueling multiple arms as well as modeling dependencies between arms. These extensions capture key characteristics found in many realworld applications, and allow for the opportunity to develop significantly more efficient algorithms than were possible in the original setting. We propose the SELFSPARRING algorithm, which reduces the multi-dueling bandits problem to a conventional bandit setting that can be solved using a stochastic bandit algorithm such as Thompson Sampling, and can naturally model dependencies using a Gaussian process prior. We present a no-regret analysis for multi-dueling setting, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm empirically on a wide range of simulation settings.

The encoding results in a number of SAT-based algorithms whose asymptotic correctness relies on weaker conditions than are standardly assumed. This implementation of a whole set of assumptions in the same platform enables us to systematically explore the effect of weakening the Faithfulness assumption on causal discovery. An important effect, suggested by simulation results, is that adopting weaker assumptions greatly alleviates the problem of conflicting constraints and substantially shortens solving time. As a result, SAT-based causal discovery is potentially more scalable under weaker assumptions.

In this paper we rule out obtaining omega = 2 in this framework from abelian groups of bounded exponent. To do this we bound the size of tricolored sum-free sets in such groups, extending the breakthrough results of Croot, Lev, Pach, Ellenberg, and Gijswijt on cap sets. As a byproduct of our proof, we show that a variant of tensor rank due to Tao gives a quantitative understanding of the notion of unstable tensor from geometric invariant theory.

Drought: Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, and Soil Moisture	ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION			English	Article; Book Chapter							ATMOSPHERE WATER FLUX	Drought is major hydrological disaster for human society and encompasses multiple hydrological components. There are numerous definitions of drought, many of which do not include transpiration or evaporation [evapotranspiration (ET)]. In this entry, we describe the role of ET in drought, and why ET is important to consider when assessing drought. We emphasize the dynamic roles of ET, precipitation, and soil moisture, with a focus on vegetation response during water stress. Finally, we conclude with a case study example of drought in Amazonia.

From 21 September -2 November 2015, the HTP discharged similar to 39 x 10(3) m(3) h(-1) of treated wastewater into Santa Monica Bay through their emergency 1-mile outfall pipe. Multi-sensor satellite remote sensing was employed to determine the biophysical impact of discharged wastewater in the shallow nearshore environment. Landsat 8 TIRS observed decreased sea surface temperatures (SST) associated with the surfacing wastewater plume. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Aqua MODIS satellite sensors were used to monitor the biological response to the addition of nutrient-rich wastewater. In situ chl-a and in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were measured before, during, and after the diversion event. These in situ data were paired with coincident OLI and MODIS satellite data to yield a more comprehensive view of the changing conditions in Santa Monica Bay due to the wastewater diversion. Two new local chl-a algorithms were empirically derived using in situ data for the OLI and MODIS sensors. These new local chl-a algorithms proved more accurate at measuring chl-a changes in Santa Monica Bay compared to the standard open ocean OC2 and OC3M algorithms, and the regional southern California CALFIT algorithm, as validated by in situ chl-a measurements. Additionally, the local OLI algorithm outperformed the local MODIS algorithm, especially in the nearshore region. A time series of chl-a, as detected by the local OLI chl-a algorithm, illustrated a very large increase in chl-a concentrations during the wastewater diversion, and a subsequent decrease in chl-a after the diversion. Our study demonstrates the capability of using Landsat 8 TIRS and OLI sensors for the monitoring of SST and surface chl-a concentrations at high spatial resolution in nearshore waters and highlights the value of these sensors for assessing the environmental effects of wastewater discharge in a coastal environment.

Colonial Tube-Dwelling Ciliates Influence Methane Cycling and Microbial Diversity within Methane Seep Ecosystems	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article						folliculinid ciliate; methane cycling; microbial ecology; methane seep; microbial diversity	EEL RIVER-BASIN; HYDROTHERMAL VENT; HYDRATE RIDGE; COLD-SEEP; AEROBIC METHANOTROPHS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; ANAEROBIC OXIDATION; FOLLICULINOPSIS SP.; WATER-COLUMN; MARINE	In a variety of marine ecosystems, microbial eukaryotes play important ecological roles; however, our knowledge of their importance in deep-sea methane seep ecosystems is limited. Microbial eukaryotes have the potential to influence microbial community composition and diversity by creating habitat heterogeneity, and may contribute to carbon cycling through grazing or symbiotic associations with microorganisms. In this study, we characterized the distribution, substrate variability and ecology of a particular group of microbial eukaryotes, known as folliculinid ciliates, at methane seeps along the eastern Pacific margin. Folliculinid ciliates were recently recognized as an abundant and ecologically important component of hydrothermal vent ecosystems, but their ecology in methane seeps has not been examined. Folliculinid ciliates inhabited methane seeps from Costa Rica to Oregon, suggesting a broad distribution in the eastern Pacific. Using phylogenetic analyses of the 18S rRNA gene, two different species of folliculinid were identified and are formally described here. Folliculinids occupied a range of physical substrates, including authigenic carbonate rocks, shells of dead vesicomyid clams, polychaete tubes and gastropod shells. Molecular analysis of the folliculinid-associated microorganisms (16S rRNA and particular methane monoxygenase) revealed that these ciliates not only influence overall microbial diversity, but also have a specific relationship with bacteria in the "Deep sea-2" methanotroph Glade. Natural delta C-13 isotope signatures of the folliculinids (-35 parts per thousand) and their C-13-enrichment patterns in shipboard (CH4)-C-13 stable isotope-probing experiments indicated these ciliates and their associated microbes are involved in cycling methane-derived carbon. Folliculinids were significantly enriched in C-13 after the addition of (CH4)-C-13 over short-term (3-8 day) incubations. Together, these results suggest that folliculinid ciliates represent a previously overlooked contributor to the ecology and biogeochemical cycling at deep-sea methane seep ecosystems.

We have used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number from observations, k(2)=0.390 +/- 0.024, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value of 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models (Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which the static k(2) ranges from 0.355 to 0382. Depending on the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a significant reduction in the number of potential models, offering great opportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal dissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a high present-day tidal ratio k(2)/Q=(1.59 +/- 0.74)x10(-4) and implying fast orbital expansions of the Moons. This high dissipation, with no obvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus and Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a core viscosity typically ranging between 10(14) and 10(16) Pa.s (Remus et al., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's frequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent, dissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in the fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Lin, 2004; Fuller et al. 2016).

CMS Collaboration	The CMS trigger system	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Trigger concepts and systems (hardware and software); Trigger detectors; Data acquisition circuits	MUON SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; TRACK	This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

Accounting Information, Investor Sentiment, and Market Pricing	JOURNAL OF LAW FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING			English	Article								One of the most significant empirical findings of the behavioral finance literature is that investor sentiment affects asset prices. Baker and Wurgler (2006) finds that shares of certain firms-those that are difficult to value-are more affected by shifts in investor sentiment. We examine whether the accounting information of firms that are inherently difficult to value can mitigate sentiment-related mispricing. Our findings indicate that sentiment-related mispricing is in fact diminished in the subset of firms with high-quality accounting information. To better understand how accounting information mitigates stock market mispricing, we examine whether sentiment affects the choices made by sell-side stock analysts. When sentiment is high, analysts issue more favorable recommendations for firms that are more difficult to value, even though these firms appear to be overpriced and exhibit negative subsequent abnormal stock returns. However, this behavior is concentrated in the subset of difficult-to-value firms with low-quality accounting information.

Tropospheric emissions: Monitoring of pollution (TEMPO)	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER			English	Article							ROTATIONAL RAMAN-SCATTERING; OZONE PROFILE RETRIEVALS; SURFACE UV IRRADIANCE; AIR-QUALITY; SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS; NO2 RETRIEVAL; GLOBAL OBSERVATIONS; CLOUD PRESSURES; NORTH-AMERICA; WATER-VAPOR	TEMPO was selected in 2012 by NASA as the first Earth Venture Instrument, for launch between 2018 and 2021. It will measure atmospheric pollution for greater North America from space using ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy. TEMPO observes from Mexico City, Cuba, and the Bahamas to the Canadian oil sands, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, hourly and at high spatial resolution (similar to 2.1 km N/S x 4.4 km E/W at 36.5 degrees N, 100 degrees W). TEMPO provides a tropospheric measurement suite that includes the key elements of tropospheric air pollution chemistry, as well as contributing to carbon cycle knowledge. Measurements are made hourly from geostationary (GEO) orbit, to capture the high variability present in the diurnal cycle of emissions and chemistry that are unobservable from current low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that measure once per day. The small product spatial footprint resolves pollution sources at sub-urban scale. Together, this temporal and spatial resolution improves emission inventories, monitors population exposure, and enables effective emission-control strategies. TEMPO takes advantage of a commercial GEO host spacecraft to provide a modest cost mission that measures the spectra required to retrieve ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), glyoxal (C2H2O2), bromine monoxide (BrO), IO (iodine monoxide), water vapor, aerosols, cloud parameters, ultraviolet radiation, and foliage properties. TEMPO thus measures the major elements, directly or by proxy, in the tropospheric O-3 chemistry cycle. Multi-spectral observations provide sensitivity to O-3 in the lowermost troposphere, substantially reducing uncertainty in air quality predictions. TEMPO quantifies and tracks the evolution of aerosol loading. It provides these near-realtime air quality products that will be made publicly available. TEMPO will launch at a prime time to be the North American component of the global geostationary constellation of pollution monitoring together with the European Sentinel-4 (S4) and Korean Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) instruments.

Though the system has been well studied, much about its fundamental properties have been difficult to determine. In this paper we report on the discovery of the heartbeat phenomenon in iota Orionis making it the most massive heartbeat system currently known. Using this phenomenon we have found empirical values for the masses and radii of both components. Moreover, we report the detection of tidally induced oscillations in an O-type star for the first time. These discoveries open a new avenue for exploring asteroseismology in massive stars.

However, the study of these subtle internal stellar properties has been limited to very indirect proxies. In the last couple of years, exciting asteroseismic results have been obtained by the Kepler satellite. Among these results are 1) The direct measure of the degree of radial differential rotation in many evolved low-mass stars and in a few massive stars, and 2) The detection of strong (>10(5) G) internal magnetic fields in thousands of red giant stars that had convective cores during their main sequence.

We present the use of a machine learning classifier to quantitatively improve the selection of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) candidates. These methods are used to separate the other stellar populations which have similar IR colours. We show the results of the classifications obtained by using the 2MASS J, H and K photometric bands, and the Spitzer/IRAC bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 mu m. The k-Nearest Neighbour method has been used to select Galactic WR candidates for observational follow-up. A few candidates have been spectroscopically observed. Preliminary observations suggest that a detection rate of 50% can easily be achieved.	[Marston, A.

The main source of the IPT is the moon Io, the most volcanically active object in the Solar System. Io is the innermost of the Galilean moons of Jupiter, the main source of the magnetospheric plasma and responsible for injecting nearly 1 ton/s of ions into Jupiter's magnetosphere. In this work ground-based observations of the [SII] 6731 angstrom emission lines are observed, obtained at the MacMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The results shown here were obtained in late 1997 and occurred shortly after a period of important eruptions observed by the Galileo mission (1996-2003). Several outbursts were observed and periods of intense volcanic activity are important to correlate with periods of brightness enhancements observed at the IPT. The time of response between an eruption and enhancement at IPT is still not well understood.

We present distributional focused carbon footprints for Chinese households and use a carbon-footprint-Gini coe cient to quantify inequalities. We find that in 2012 the urban very rich, comprising 5% of population, induced 19% of the total carbon footprint from household consumption in China, with 6.4 tCO(2)/cap. The average Chinese household footprint remains comparatively low (1.7 tCO(2)/cap), while those of the rural population and urban poor, comprising 58% of population, are 0.5-1.6 tCO(2)/cap. Between 2007 and 2012 the total footprint from households increased by 19%, with 75% of the increase due to growing consumption of the urban middle class and the rich. This suggests that a transformation of Chinese lifestyles away from the current trajectory of carbon-intensive consumption patterns requires policy interventions to improve living standards and encourage sustainable consumption.

Universality of pseudogap and emergent order in lightly doped Mott insulators	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							COPPER OXIDES; EVOLUTION; BI2SR2CACU2O8+DELTA; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; METAL	It is widely believed that high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates emerges from doped Mott insulators'. When extra carriers are inserted into the parent state, the electrons become mobile but the strong correlations from the Mott state are thought to survive inhomogeneous electronic order, a mysterious pseudogap and, eventually, superconductivity appear. How the insertion of dopant atoms drives this evolution is not known, nor is whether these phenomena are mere distractions specific to hole-doped cuprates or represent genuine physics of doped Mott insulators. Here we visualize the evolution of the electronic states of (Sr1-xLax)(2)IrO4, which is an effective spin-1/2 Mott insulator like the cuprates, but is chemically radically different(2,3). Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy (SI-STM), we find that for a doping concentration of x approximate to 5%, an inhomogeneous, phase separated state emerges, with the nucleation of pseudogap puddles around clusters of dopant atoms. Within these puddles, we observe the same iconic electronic order that is seen in underdoped cupratesle(1,4-9). We investigate the genesis of this state and find evidence at low doping for deeply trapped carriers, leading to fully gapped spectra, which abruptly collapse at a threshold of x approximate to 4%. Our results clarify the melting of the Mott state, and establish phase separation and electronic order as generic features of doped Mott insulators.	[Battisti, I.; Bastiaans, K.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of in situ datasets and their variable adherence to meta/data standards poses a significant impediment to interoperability and long-term data stewardship. Here we introduce the Oceanographic in situ data Interoperability Project, a collaboration between JPL PO.DAAC, UCAR/Unidata and the Large Pelagics Research Center (UMASS-Boston) that aims to address these challenges. It involves the enhancement and integration of available technology components for improved interoperability and support of in situ data with a focus on a representative yet complex class of oceanographic field data: data from electronic tags deployed on a variety of marine species. Beyond this technical development work itself, an innovative part of our project involves collaborating with the electronic tag manufacturer Wildlife Computers and actively engaging tagging community stakeholders to promote the adoption of appropriate data standards. The project thus adopts a model lifecycle approach complimented by broadly applicable technologies to address key data management and interoperability issues for electronic tagging data and other marine in situ datasets. In this paper, we review the motivation, approach and current status of the work, 9 months into the project.

However, the clinical useful drugs for targeting GPCR have been limited by the lack of subtype selectivity or efficacy, leading to undesirable side effects. To develop subtype-selective GPCR ligands with desired molecular properties, better understanding is needed of the pharmacophore elements and of the binding mechanism required for subtype selectivity. To illustrate these issues, we describe here three successful applications to understand the binding mechanism associated with subtype selectivity: 5-HT2B (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) serotonin receptor (HT2BR), H-3 histamine receptor (H3HR) and A(3) adenosine receptor (A(3)AR). The understanding of structure-function relationships among individual types and subtypes of GPCRs gained from such computational predictions combined with experimental validation and testing is expected the development of new highly selective and effective ligands to address such diseases while minimizing side-effects.

Social psychologists have shown that people manage these impressions differently depending upon their personality. Facebook and other social media provide a new forum for this fundamental process; hence, understanding people's behaviour on social media could provide interesting insights on their personality. In this paper we investigate automatic personality recognition from Facebook profile pictures. We analyze the effectiveness of four families of visual features and we discuss some human interpretable patterns that explain the personality traits of the individuals. For example, extroverts and agreeable individuals tend to have warm colored pictures and to exhibit many faces in their portraits, mirroring their inclination to socialize; while neurotic ones have a prevalence of pictures of indoor places. Then, we propose a classification approach to automatically recognize personality traits from these visual features. Finally, we compare the performance of our classification approach to the one obtained by human raters and we show that computer-based classifications are significantly more accurate than averaged human-based classifications for Extraversion and Neuroticism.

The design of such platforms is a complex mixture of economics and engineering, and how to "optimally" design such platforms is still an open problem. In this paper, we focus on the design of prices and subsidies in sharing platforms. Our results provide insights into the tradeoff between revenue maximizing prices and social welfare maximizing prices. Specifically, we introduce a novel model of sharing platforms and characterize the profit and social welfare maximizing prices in this model. Further, we bound the efficiency loss under profit maximizing prices, showing that there is a strong alignment between profit and efficiency in practical settings. Our results highlight that the revenue of platforms may be limited in practice due to supply shortages; thus platforms have a strong incentive to encourage sharing via subsidies. We provide an analytic characterization of when such subsidies are valuable and show how to optimize the size of the subsidy provided. Finally, we validate the insights from our analysis using data from Didi Chuxing, the largest ridesharing platform in China.

However, the slanted direction of the measurements complicates interpretation of the signal, especially in regions that are subject to multiple deformation processes. The Simultaneous and Integrated Strain Tensor Estimation from Geodetic and Satellite Deformation Measurements (SISTEM) algorithm enables decomposition into a three-dimensional velocity field through joint inversion with GNSS measurements, but has never been applied to interseismic deformation where strain rates are low. Here, we apply SISTEM for the first time to detect tectonic deformation on the Hyblean Foreland Plateau in South-East Sicily. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the DInSAR data beforehand, we reduce atmospheric InSAR noise using a weather model and combine it with a multi-directional spatial filtering technique. The resultant three-dimensional velocity field allows identification of anthropogenic, as well as tectonic deformation, with sub-centimeter accuracies in areas of sufficient GPS coverage. Our enhanced method allows for a more detailed view of ongoing deformation processes as compared to the single use of either GNSS or DInSAR only and thus is suited to improve assessments of regional seismic hazard.

A projection of RR Lyrae stars within vertical bar(B) over tilde vertical bar(circle dot) < 9 degrees of the Sgr stream's orbital plane reveals the morphology of both the leading and the trailing arms at very high contrast. We fit a model for the angular mean distance and line-of-sight depth, resulting in estimates of the mean stream distance precise to similar to 1% and resolving the stream's line-of-sight depth. These improved geometric constraints can serve as new restrictions for dynamical stream models.

This is likely due to a combination of factors, chief among them long frequencies, on the order of days, and weak amplitudes (approximate to 1 mmag and below). Fortunately, through the discovery of the most massive heartbeat system iota Orionis and it's corresponding tidally induced oscillations with BRITE-Constellation there exists a new avenue with which to explore O star asteroseismology. In this paper we will give a prescription for using tidally induced oscillations to do asteroseismic analysis on O stars and present a list of candidate systems for this analysis within the BRITE sample.

We combined our data with 44 previous published Sr isotope measurements and five paleomagnetostratigraphic sections in order to place the foreland deposits in a chronostratigraphic framework. Two chronostratigraphic charts were created, and transgressive-regressive system tracts were identified in the western and eastern sectors of the Zagros. These results show that the southward migration of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt led to broadly upwardcoarsening, progradational sequences due to progressive uplift and seaward (southwestward) migration of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt. In addition, we show distinct differences in the sequences between the eastern and western sectors. It can be inferred that, in the strike-parallel direction, the Zagros foreland basin did not respond in a simple manner to tectonics and global sea-level changes during the Neogene. The different architecture of the sequences and mismatch of Neogene sedimentary architecture with global sea-level curves imply different orogen-parallel evolutionary histories and strong impact of tectonics on the basin evolution as compared to eustasy. Finally, we present evidence for a retrogradational sequence related to a period of enhanced deformation and related crustal thickening during the middle Miocene in the eastern Zagros.

Unlike previous work, we keep the most general functional model but make an assumption on the unobserved exogenous variable: Inspired by Occam's razor, we assume that the exogenous variable is simple in the true causal direction. We quantify simplicity using Renyi entropy. Our main result is that, under natural assumptions, if the exogenous variable has low H-0 entropy (cardinality) in the true direction, it must have high H-0 entropy in the wrong direction. We establish several algorithmic hardness results about estimating the minimum entropy exogenous variable. We show that the problem of finding the exogenous variable with minimum H-1 entropy (Shannon Entropy) is equivalent to the problem of finding minimum joint entropy given n marginal distributions, also known as minimum entropy coupling problem. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm for the minimum entropy coupling problem, that for n = 2 provably finds a local optimum. This gives a greedy algorithm for finding the exogenous variable with minimum Shannon entropy. Our greedy entropy-based causal inference algorithm has similar performance to the state of the art additive noise models in real datasets. One advantage of our approach is that we make no use of the values of random variables but only their distributions. Our method can therefore be used for causal inference for both ordinal and also categorical data, unlike additive noise models.

THIRTY-FIRST AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	31st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence	FEB 04-09, 2017	San Francisco, CA	Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence			RECOGNITION	While the universal approximation property holds both for hierarchical and shallow networks, deep networks can approximate the class of compositional functions as well as shallow networks but with exponentially lower number of training parameters and sample complexity. Compositional functions are obtained as a hierarchy of local constituent functions, where "local functions" are functions with low dimensionality. This theorem proves an old conjecture by Bengio on the role of depth in networks, characterizing precisely the conditions under which it holds. It also suggests possible answers to the the puzzle of why high-dimensional deep networks trained on large training sets often do not seem to show overfit.

We desire a computer vision system (e.g., a robot) that can recognize human activities and assist our daily life, yet ensure that it is not recording video that may invade our privacy. This paper presents a fundamental approach to address such contradicting objectives: human activity recognition while only using extreme low-resolution (e.g., 16x12) anonymized videos. We introduce the paradigm of inverse super resolution (ISR), the concept of learning the optimal set of image transformations to generate multiple low-resolution (LR) training videos from a single video. Our ISR learns different types of sub-pixel transformations optimized for the activity classification, allowing the classifier to best take advantage of existing high-resolution videos (e.g., YouTube videos) by creating multiple LR training videos tailored for the problem. We experimentally confirm that the paradigm of inverse super resolution is able to benefit activity recognition from extreme low-resolution videos.

Phase-Mapper: An AI Platform to Accelerate High Throughput Materials Discovery	THIRTY-FIRST AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	31st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence	FEB 04-09, 2017	San Francisco, CA	Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence				High-throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis, measurement, and characterization of many different but structurally related materials. A central problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification problem, involves the determination of the crystal structure of materials from materials composition and structural characterization data. We present Phase-Mapper, a novel solution platform that allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AI algorithms, including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain or initialize solutions. Phase-Mapper is compatible with any spectral demixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on convolutive non-negative matrix factorization. AgileFD allows materials scientists to rapidly interpret XRD patterns, and can incorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well as human feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposed methods in a large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems, demonstrating the efficacy of imposing physical constraints using AgileFD. Since the deployment of Phase-Mapper at the Department of Energy's Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), thousands of X-ray diffraction patterns have been processed and the results are yielding discovery of new materials for energy applications, as exemplified by the discovery of a new family of metal oxide solar light absorbers, among the previously unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system, which is provided here as an illustrative example. Phase-Mapper is also being deployed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) to enable phase mapping on datasets in real time.

Interferences by HNO3, CO2 and H2O have to be accounted for. Application of this approach to observations recorded within the framework of long-term monitoring activities carried out at the northern mid-latitude, high-altitude Jungfraujoch station in Switzerland (46.5 degrees N, 8.0 degrees E, 3580 m above sea level) has provided a total column times series spanning the 1989 to mid-2015 time period. A fit to the HCFC-142b daily mean total column time series shows a statistically-significant long-term trend of (1.23 +/- 0.08 x 10(13) molec cm(-2)) per year from 2000 to 2010, at the 2-sigma confidence level. This corresponds to a significant atmospheric accumulation of (0.94 +/- 0.06) ppt (1 ppt =1/10(12)) per year for the mean tropospheric mixing ratio, at the 2-sigma confidence level. Over the subsequent time period (2010-2014), we note a significant slowing down in the HCFC-142b buildup. Our ground-based FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) results are compared with relevant data sets derived from surface in situ measurements at the Mace Head and Jungfraujoch sites of the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) network and from occultation measurements by the ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer) instrument on-board the SCISAT satellite.

In addition, the associated temperature dependences of these coefficients have been measured in the 4300-4500 cm(-1) region of the Octad. The high signal to noise ratio spectra of pure methane and of dilute mixtures of methane in dry air with high resolution have been recorded at temperatures from 148 K to room temperature using the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. The analysis of spectra was done using a multispectrum non-linear least squares curve fitting technique.

Polygonal ridge networks on Mars: Diversity of morphologies and the special case of the Eastern Medusae Fossae Formation	ICARUS			English	Article						Mars; Surface; Geological processes; Mars; Volcanism; Hydrology	FAN-SHAPED DEPOSIT; GALE CRATER; ORIGIN; FAULTS; HELLAS; EVOLUTION; HISTORY; EROSION; SURFACE; FLOOR	Polygonal ridge networks, also known as boxwork or reticulate ridges, are found in numerous locations and geological contexts across Mars. Distinguishing the morphologies and geological context of the ridge networks sheds light on their potential as astrobiological and mineral resource sites of interest. The most widespread type of ridge morphology is characteristic of the Nili Fossae and Nilosyrtis region and consists of thin, criss-crossing ridges with a variety of heights, widths, and intersection angles. They are found in ancient Noachian terrains at a variety of altitudes (between -2500 and 2200 m) and geographic locations and are likely to be chemically altered fracture planes or mineral veins. They occur in the same general areas as valley networks and ancient lake basins, but they are not more numerous where these water-related features are concentrated, and can appear in places where th morphologies are absent. Similarly, some of the ridge networks are located near hydrated mineral detections, but there is not a one-to-one correlation. Smaller, light-toned ridges of variable widths have been found in Gale Crater and other rover sites and are interpreted to be smaller versions of the Nili-like ridges, mostly formed by the mineralization of fractures. This type of ridge is likely to be found in many other places on Mars as more high-resolution data become available. Sinus Meridiani contains many flat-topped ridges arranged into quasi-circular patterns. The ridges are eroding from a clay-rich unit, and could be formed by a similar process as the Nili-type ridges, but at a much larger scale and controlled by fractures made through a different process. Hellas Basin is host to a fourth type of ridge morphology consisting of large, thick, light-toned ridges forming regular polygons at several superimposed scales. While still enigmatic, these are most likely to be the result of sediment-filled fractures. The Eastern Medusae Fossae Formation contains large swaths of a fifth, previously undocumented, ridge network type. The dark ridges, reaching up to 50m in height, enclose regular polygons and erode into dark boulders. These ridge networks are interpreted to form as a result of lava flow embayment of deeply fractured Medusae Fossae Formation outcrops. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cassini microwave observations provide clues to the origin of Saturn's C ring	ICARUS			English	Article						Saturn, rings; Planetary rings; Radar observations; Origin, Solar system	INFRARED OBSERVATIONS; PARTICLE COMPOSITION; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SYSTEM; ACCRETION; EVOLUTION; RADAR; WAKES; MOONS	Despite considerable study, Saturn's rings continue to challenge current theories for their provenance. Water ice comprises the bulk of Saturn's rings, yet it is the small fraction of non-icy material that is arguably more valuable in revealing clues about the system's origin and age. Herein, we present new measurements of the non-icy material fraction in Saturn's C ring, determined from microwave radiometry observations acquired by the Cassini spacecraft. Our observations show an exceptionally high brightness at near-zero azimuthal angles, suggesting a high porosity of 70-75% for the C ring particles. Furthermore, our results show that most regions in the C ring contain about 1-2% silicates. These results are consistent with an initially nearly pure-ice ring system that has been continuously contaminated by in-falling microwmeteoroids over similar to 15-90 million years, using the currently accepted value of the micrometeoroid flux at infinity of similar to 4.5 x 10(-17)g cm(-2) s(-1), and assuming that the C ring optical depth and surface density has not changed significantly during that time. This absolute time scale is inversely proportional not only to the flux at infinity, but also to the amount of gravitational focusing by Saturn the micrometeoroids experience before encountering the rings. We also find an enhanced abundance of non-icy material concentrated in the middle C ring. When assumed to be mixed volumetrically ("intramixed") with water ice, this enhanced contamination reaches a maximum concentration of 6-11% silicates by volume around a ring radius of 83,000 km, depending on the volume mixing model used. This is significantly higher than the inner and outer C ring. As opposed to an intramixing model, we also consider a silicate-core, icy mantle model to address the fact that silicates may be present in chunks instead of fine powder in the ring particles. Such a model naturally helps to account for the observed opacity distribution. We propose several models to explain the radially varied non-icy material contamination. Our preferred model is that the C ring has been continuously polluted by meteoroid bombardment since it first formed, while the middle C ring was further contaminated by an incoming Centaur, a rocky object torn apart by tides and ultimately broken into pieces that currently reside in the middle C ring. If correct, the spatial extent of the enhanced non-icy material fraction suggests that the Centaur was likely to be captured and integrated into the rings perhaps as recently as similar to 10-20 million years ago.

Bright prospects for radar detection of Europa's ocean	ICARUS			English	Article						Radar sounding; Regolith; Ocean; Volume scattering; Icy moon	ICY GALILEAN SATELLITES	The surface of Europa has been hypothesized to include an ice regolith layer from hundreds of meters to kilometers in thickness. However, contrary to previous claims, it does not present a significant obstacle to searching for Europa's ocean with radar sounding. This note corrects prior volume scattering loss analyses and expands them to includes observational and thermo-mechanical constraints on pore size and regolith depth. This provides a more physically realistic range of potential ice-regolith volume-scattering losses for radar sounding observations of Europa's ice shell in the HF and VHF frequency bands. We conclude that, for the range of physical processes and material properties observed or hypothesized for Europa, volume scattering losses are not likely to pose a major obstacle to radar penetration.

We particularly focus on how the planetary mass M-oli at the onset of oligarchic growth depends on the initial mass m(0) of a planetesimal. Oligarchic growth commences when the velocity dispersion relative to the Hill velocity of the protoplanet takes its minimum. We find that if m(0) is small enough, this normalized velocity dispersion becomes as low as unity during the intermediate stage between the runaway and oligarchic growth stages. In this case, M-oli is independent of m(0). If m(0) is large, on the other hand, oligarchic growth commences directly after runaway growth, and M-oli alpha m(0)(3/7). The planetary mass M-oli for the solid surface density of the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula is close to the masses of the dwarf planets in a reasonable range of m(0). This indicates that they are likely to be the largest remnant planetesimals that failed to become planets. The power-law exponent q of the differential mass distribution of remnant planetesimals is typically -2.0 and -2.7 to -2.5 for small and large m(0). The slope, q similar or equal to -2.7, and the bump at 10(21) g (or 50 km in radius) for the mass distribution of hot Kuiper belt objects are reproduced if m(0) is the bump mass. On the other hand, small initial planetesimals with m(0) similar to 10(13) g or less are favored to explain the slope of large asteroids, q similar or equal to -2.0, while the bump at 10(21) g can be reproduced by introducing a small number of asteroid seeds each with mass of 10(19) g.

Two-Step Phase Transition in SnSe and the Origins of its High Power Factor from First Principles	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; THERMOELECTRIC PERFORMANCE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; EQUATION	The interest in improving the thermoelectric response of bulk materials has received a boost after it has been recognized that layered materials, in particular SnSe, show a very large thermoelectric figure of merit. This result has received great attention while it is now possible to conceive other similar materials or experimental methods to improve this value. Before we can now think of engineering this material it is important we understand the basic mechanism that explains this unusual behavior, where very low thermal conductivity and a high thermopower result from a delicate balance between the crystal and electronic structure. In this Letter, we present a complete temperature evolution of the Seebeck coefficient as the material undergoes a soft crystal transformation and its consequences on other properties within SnSe by means of first-principles calculations. Our results are able to explain the full range of considered experimental temperatures.

Spectral characteristics of background error covariance and multiscale data assimilation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS			English	Article						Variational data assimilation; Kalman Filter; atmospheric and oceanic models; multiscale algorithm; background error covariance; spectral power density	VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; ATMOSPHERIC DATA ASSIMILATION; PART I; ANALYSIS SYSTEM; SCHEME; FORMULATION; CLOUD; IMPLEMENTATION; PREDICTION	The spatial resolutions of numerical atmospheric and oceanic circulation models have steadily increased over the past decades. Horizontal grid spacing down to the order of 1 km is now often used to resolve cloud systems in the atmosphere and sub-mesoscale circulation systems in the ocean. These fine resolution models encompass a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, across which dynamical and statistical properties vary. In particular, dynamic flow systems at small scales can be spatially localized and temporarily intermittent. Difficulties of current data assimilation algorithms for such fine resolution models are numerically and theoretically examined. An analysis shows that the background error correlation length scale is larger than 75 km for streamfunctions and is larger than 25 km for water vapor mixing ratios, even for a 2-km resolution model. A theoretical analysis suggests that such correlation length scales prevent the currently used data assimilation schemes from constraining spatial scales smaller than 150 km for streamfunctions and 50 km for water vapor mixing ratios. These results highlight the need to fundamentally modify currently used data assimilation algorithms for assimilating high-resolution observations into the aforementioned fine resolution models. Within the framework of four-dimensional variational data assimilation, a multiscale methodology based on scale decomposition is suggested and challenges are discussed.

Charge metastability and hysteresis in the quantum Hall regime	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTRON-SYSTEM; SURFACE ACOUSTIC-WAVES; LANDAU-LEVEL; TRANSITIONS; GAS; FERROMAGNETISM; PROPAGATION; SPIKES; MODEL	We report simultaneous quasi-dc magnetotransport and high-frequency surface acoustic wave measurements on bilayer two-dimensional electron systems in GaAs. Near strong integer quantized Hall states, a strong magnetic-field-sweep hysteresis in the velocity of the acoustic waves is observed at low temperatures. This hysteresis indicates the presence of a metastable state with anomalously high conductivity in the interior of the sample. This nonequilibrium state is not revealed by conventional low-frequency transport measurements which are dominated by dissipationless transport at the edge of the two-dimensional system. We find that a field-cooling technique allows the equilibrium charge configuration within the interior of the sample to be established. A simple model for this behavior is discussed.

Impact of an improved neutrino energy estimate on outflows in neutron star merger simulations	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							EQUATION-OF-STATE; GAMMA-RAY BURSTS; R-PROCESS; DYNAMICAL EJECTA; GRAVITATIONAL-WAVES; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; PHYSICAL MODELS; MASS; EVOLUTION; WIND	Binary neutron star mergers are promising sources of gravitational waves for ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO. Neutron-rich material ejected by these mergers may also be the main source of r-process elements in the Universe, while radioactive decays in the ejecta can power bright electromagnetic postmerger signals. Neutrino-matter interactions play a critical role in the evolution of the composition of the ejected material, which significantly impacts the outcome of nucleosynthesis and the properties of the associated electromagnetic signal. In this work, we present a simulation of a binary neutron star merger using an improved method for estimating the average neutrino energies in our energy-integrated neutrino transport scheme. These energy estimates are obtained by evolving the neutrino number density in addition to the neutrino energy and flux densities. We show that significant changes are observed in the composition of the polar ejecta when comparing our new results with earlier simulations in which the neutrino spectrum was assumed to be the same everywhere in optically thin regions. In particular, we find that material ejected in the polar regions is less neutron rich than previously estimated. Our new estimates of the composition of the polar ejecta make it more likely that the color and time scale of the electromagnetic signal depend on the orientation of the binary with respect to an observer's line of sight. These results also indicate that important observable properties of neutron star mergers are sensitive to the neutrino energy spectrum, and may need to be studied through simulations including a more accurate, energy-dependent neutrino transport scheme.

CMS Collaboration	Searches for R-parity-violating supersymmetry in pp collisions at root s=8 TeV in final states with 0-4 leptons	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							E(+)E(-) COLLISIONS; PARTICLES; DECAYS; SQUARK	Results are presented from searches for R-parity-violating supersymmetry in events produced in pp collisions at root s = 8 TeV at the LHC. Final states with 0, 1, 2, or multiple leptons are considered independently. The analysis is performed on data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 fb(-1). No excesses of events above the standard model expectations are observed, and 95% confidence level limits are set on supersymmetric particle masses and production cross sections. The results are interpreted in models featuring R-parity-violating decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle, which in the studied scenarios can be either the gluino, a bottom squark, or a neutralino. In a gluino pair production model with baryon number violation, gluinos with a mass less than 0.98 and 1.03 TeV are excluded, by analyses in a fully hadronic and one-lepton final state, respectively. An analysis in a dilepton final state is used to exclude bottom squarks with masses less than 307 GeV in a model considering bottom squark pair production. Multilepton final states are considered in the context of either strong or electroweak production of superpartners and are used to set limits on the masses of the lightest supersymmetric particles. These limits range from 300 to 900 GeV in models with leptonic and up to approximately 700 GeV in models with semileptonic R-parity-violating couplings.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

Extensive winter subglacial water storage beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							LAND-TERMINATING SECTOR; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; SURFACE MELTWATER; RADAR ATTENUATION; BASAL CONDITIONS; RUSSELL GLACIER; GROUNDING-ZONE; FLOW; MELT; EVOLUTION	Surface meltwater that reaches the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet exerts a fundamental impact on ice flow, but observations of catchment-wide movement and distribution of subglacial water remain limited. Using radar-sounding data from two seasons, we identify the seasonal distribution of subglacial water in western Greenland. Our analysis provides evidence of widespread subglacial water storage beneath Greenland in the wintertime. The winter storage is located primarily on bedrock ridges with higher bed elevations in excess of 200 m. During the melt season water moves to the subglacial troughs. This inverse relationship with topography indicates that the material properties of the glacier bed strongly influence subglacial drainage development. Both the spatial variations in bed properties and the initial state of the subglacial hydrology system at the start of the melt season lead to differing glacier dynamical responses to surface melting across the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (climate models) simulate a wide range of magnitudes of unforced interdecadal variability in global mean surface air temperature (UITglobal), hampering efforts to quantify the influence of UITglobal on contemporary global temperature trends. Recently, a preliminary consensus has emerged that unforced interdecadal variability in local surface temperatures (UITlocal) over the tropical Pacific Ocean is particularly influential on UITglobal. Therefore, a reasonable hypothesis might be that the large spread in the magnitude of UITglobal across climate models can be explained by the spread in the magnitude of simulated tropical Pacific UITlocal. Here we show that this hypothesis is mostly false. Instead, the spread in the magnitude of UITglobal is linked much more strongly to the spread in the magnitude of UITlocal over high-latitude regions characterized by significant variability in oceanic convection, sea ice concentration, and energy flux at both the surface and the top of the atmosphere. Thus, efforts to constrain the climate model produced range of UITglobal magnitude would be best served by focusing on the simulation of air-sea interaction at high latitudes.

Tomographic reconstruction of an aerosol plume using passive multiangle observations from the MISR satellite instrument	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ALGORITHM	We present initial results using computed tomography to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of an aerosol plume from passive observations made by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA's Terra satellite. MISR views the Earth from nine different angles at four visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Adopting the 672 nm channel, we treat each view as an independent measure of aerosol optical thickness along the line of sight at 1.1 km resolution. A smoke plume over dark water is selected as it provides a more tractable lower boundary condition for the retrieval. A tomographic algorithm is used to reconstruct the horizontal and vertical aerosol extinction field for one along-track slice from the path of all camera rays passing through a regular grid. The results compare well with ground-based lidar observations from a nearby Micropulse Lidar Network site.

Previous attempts to find singular flow structures have proven inconclusive. We reconsider the problem of interacting vortex tubes, for which it has long been observed that the flattening of the vortices inhibits sustained self-amplification of velocity gradients. Here we consider an iterative mechanism, based on the transformation of vortex filaments into sheets and their subsequent instability back into filaments. Elementary fluid mechanical arguments are provided to support the formation of a singular structure via this iterated mechanism, which we analyze based on a simplified model of filament interactions.

The Coriolis effect on mass wasting during the Rheasilvia impact on asteroid Vesta	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							ACOUSTIC FLUIDIZATION; DAWN; GRAVITY; LANDSLIDES; MOBILITY; PHYSICS; MODELS; SHAPE; POLE	We investigate the influence of the Coriolis force on mass motion related to the Rheasilvia impact on asteroid Vesta. Observations by the NASA Dawn mission revealed a pattern of curved radial ridges, which are related to Coriolis-deflected mass-wasting during the initial modification stage of the crater. Utilizing the projected curvature of the mass-wasting trajectories, we developed a method that enabled investigation of the initial mass wasting of the Rheasilvia impact by observational means. We demonstrate that the Coriolis force can strongly affect the crater formation processes on rapidly rotating objects, and we derive the material's velocities (28.9 +/- 22.5 m/s), viscosities (1.5-9.0 x 10(6) Pa s) and coefficients of friction (0.02-0.81) during the impact modification stage. The duration of the impact modification stage could be estimated to (1.1 +/- 0.5) h. By analyzing the velocity distribution with respect to the topography, we deduce that the Rheasilvia impactor hit a heterogeneous target and that the initial crater walls were significantly steeper during the modification stage.

Loss of O-GlcNAc glycosylation in forebrain excitatory neurons induces neurodegeneration	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						O-GlcNAc; glycosylation; neurodegeneration; tau; amyloid beta	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; TRANSGENIC MICE; AMYLOID PLAQUE; MOUSE MODELS; BETA; TAU; GLCNACYLATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; AGGREGATION	O-GlcNAc glycosylation (or O-GlcNAcylation) is a dynamic, inducible posttranslational modification found on proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as a-synuclein, amyloid precursor protein, and tau. Deletion of the O-GlcNAc transferase (ogt) gene responsible for the modification causes early postnatal lethality in mice, complicating efforts to study O-GlcNAcylation in mature neurons and to understand its roles in disease. Here, we report that forebrain-specific loss of OGT in adult mice leads to progressive neurodegeneration, including widespread neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation, increased production of hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloidogenic A beta-peptides, and memory deficits. Furthermore, we show that human cortical brain tissue from Alzheimer's disease patients has significantly reduced levels of OGT protein expression compared with cortical tissue from control individuals. Together, these studies indicate that O-GlcNAcylation regulates pathways critical for the maintenance of neuronal health and suggest that dysfunctional O-GlcNAc signaling may be an important contributor to neurodegenerative diseases.

Tryptophan Synthase Uses an Atypical Mechanism To Achieve Substrate Specificity	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							BIENZYME COMPLEX; ALLOSTERIC REGULATION; SUBUNIT	Tryptophan synthase (TrpS) catalyzes the final steps in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan from L-serine (Ser) and indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP). We report that native TrpS can also catalyze a productive reaction with L-threonine (Thr), leading to (2S,3S)-beta-methyltryptophan. Surprisingly, beta-substitution occurs in vitro with a 3.4-fold higher catalytic efficiency for Ser over Thr using saturating indole, despite a >82000-fold preference for Ser in direct competition using IGP. Structural data identify a novel product binding site, and kinetic experiments clarify the atypical mechanism of specificity: Thr binds efficiently but decreases the affinity for indole and disrupts the allosteric signaling that regulates the catalytic cycle.

This LS theory accounts for hard-core excluded volume repulsion by the Boublik-Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland equation of state, electrostatic correlation by the mean-spherical approximation, and chain connectivity by the first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory. We predict a closed-loop binodal curve in the PE concentration-salt concentration phase diagram when the Bjerrum length is smaller than the critical Bjerrum length in salt-free PE solution. The phase-separated region shrinks with decreasing Bjerrum length, and disappears below a critical Bjerrum length. These results are qualitatively consistent with experiments, but cannot be captured by the Voorn-Overbeek theory. On the basis of the closed-loop binodal curve and the lever rule, we predict three scenarios of salting-out and salting-in phenomena with addition of monovalent salt into an initially salt-free PE solution. The Galvani potential-the electric potential difference between the coexisting phases is found to depend nonmonotonically on the overall salt concentration in some PE concentration range, which is related to the partition of the co-ions in the coexisting phases. Free energy analysis suggests that phase separation is driven by a gain in the electrostatic energy, at the expense of a large translational entropy penalty, due to significant counterion accumulation in the PE-rich phase.

GWs are emitted from deep inside the core, and, as such, they are direct probes of the CCSN explosion mechanism. In this study, we show how we can determine the CCSN explosion mechanism from a GW supernova detection using a combination of principal component analysis and Bayesian model selection. We use simulations of GW signals from CCSN exploding via neutrino-driven convection and rapidly rotating core collapse. Previous studies have shown that the explosion mechanism can be determined using one LIGO detector and simulated Gaussian noise. As real GW detector noise is both nonstationary and non-Gaussian, we use real detector noise from a network of detectors with a sensitivity altered to match the advanced detectors design sensitivity. For the first time, we carry out a careful selection of the number of principal components to enhance our model selection capabilities. We show that with an advanced detector network we can determine if the CCSN explosion mechanism is driven by neutrino convection for sources in our Galaxy and rapidly-rotating core collapse for sources out to the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Non-invasive imaging using reporter genes altering cellular water permeability	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; IN-VIVO; MRI REPORTER; REGENERATIVE MEDICINE; RNA INTERFERENCE; CONTRAST AGENTS; PERFUSED CELLS; DIFFUSION; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN	Non-invasive imaging of gene expression in live, optically opaque animals is important for multiple applications, including monitoring of genetic circuits and tracking of cell-based therapeutics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could enable such monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, existing MRI reporter genes based on metalloproteins or chemical exchange probes are limited by their reliance on metals or relatively low sensitivity. Here we introduce a new class of MRI reporters based on the human water channel aquaporin 1. We show that aquaporin overexpression produces contrast in diffusion-weighted MRI by increasing tissue water diffusivity without affecting viability. Low aquaporin levels or mixed populations comprising as few as 10% aquaporin-expressing cells are sufficient to produce MRI contrast. We characterize this new contrast mechanism through experiments and simulations, and demonstrate its utility in vivo by imaging gene expression in tumours. Our results establish an alternative class of sensitive, metal-free reporter genes for non-invasive imaging.

Thirty-one grains from detrital fragments of ferruginous duricrust yield ages in the 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 0.7 +/- 0.1 Ma range. The results show that goethites from detrital blocks are generally older than those from the in situ ferruginous layers and that all the goethites from the Guarapuava sites are relatively young (6.2 +/- 0.6 Ma). Goethites show variable U and Th contents depending on the mode of precipitation. Goethite that forms by progressive ferrugization and pseudomorphic replacement of basalts are rich in Th, U-poor, contain various mineral inclusions (e.g., kaolinite, rutile, ilmenite) and display a distinct "checkered" appearance. Colloform goethite precipitated within cavities and desiccation cracks contain higher U, show low Th/U values, and are free of mineral contaminants, suggesting direct precipitation from solution. The geochronological results reveal a dynamic evolution for the soils overlying the Parana basalt, where recurrent duricrust formation and dismantling lead to the evolution of regional colluvial soil profiles while simultaneously preventing the evolution of chemically stratified lateritic weathering profiles. The modes of formation and U, Th, and He contents of goethite at Guarapuava provide useful constraints on the expected compositions and modes of formation of goethite formed on basaltic soils on Mars.

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko	SCIENCE			English	Article							OPTICAL-CONSTANTS; WATER ICE; SURFACE; VIRTIS; ROTATION; SHAPE; DARK; H2O; CO2	Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most abundant species in cometary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO2 ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO2 ice-rich surface area located in the Anhur region of comet 67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80-by 60-meter area is CO2 ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the comet exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO2 ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO2 ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO2 ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the comet.

Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature	SCIENCE			English	Article							EXPOSED WATER ICE; H2O ICE; NUCLEUS; SURFACE; OSIRIS; MORPHOLOGY; VIRTIS	The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.	[Fornasier, S.; Barucci, M. A.; Feller, C.; Deshapriya, J. D.

J	MacMartin, DG; Kravitz, B				MacMartin, Douglas G.; Kravitz, Ben			Dynamic climate emulators for solar geoengineering	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							SCENARIO; MODEL	Climate emulators trained on existing simulations can be used to project project the climate effects that result from different possible future pathways of anthropogenic forcing, without further relying on general circulation model (GCM) simulations. We extend this idea to include different amounts of solar geoengineering in addition to different pathways of greenhouse gas concentrations, by training emulators from a multi-model ensemble of simulations from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The emulator is trained on the abrupt 4xCO(2) and a compensating solar reduction simulation (G1), and evaluated by comparing predictions against a simulated 1% per year CO2 increase and a similarly smaller solar reduction (G2). We find reasonable agreement in most models for predicting changes in temperature and precipitation (including regional effects), and annual-mean Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent, with the difference between simulation and prediction typically being smaller than natural variability. This verifies that the linearity assumption used in constructing the emulator is sufficient for these variables over the range of forcing considered. Annual-minimum Northern Hemisphere sea ice extent is less well predicted, indicating a limit to the linearity assumption.

In contrast, information-theoretic entropy, introduced by Shannon, is a measure of uncertainty. In this Letter, we connect these two notions of entropy, using an axiomatic framework for thermodynamics [E.H. Lieb and J. Yngvason Proc. R. Soc. 469, 20130408 (2013)]. In particular, we obtain a direct relation between the Clausius entropy and the Shannon entropy, or its generalization to quantum systems, the von Neumann entropy. More generally, we find that entropy measures relevant in nonequilibrium thermodynamics correspond to entropies used in one-shot information theory.

Towards a first design of a Newtonian-noise cancellation system for Advanced LIGO	CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY			English	Article						Newtonian noise; seismometers; Wiener filter		Newtonian gravitational noise from seismic fields is predicted to be a limiting noise source at low frequency for second generation gravitational-wave detectors. Mitigation of this noise will be achieved by Wiener filtering using arrays of seismometers deployed in the vicinity of all test masses. In this work, we present optimized configurations of seismometer arrays using a variety of simplified models of the seismic field based on seismic observations at LIGO Hanford. The model that best fits the seismic measurements leads to noise reduction limited predominantly by seismometer self-noise. A first simplified design of seismic arrays for Newtonian-noise cancellation at the LIGO sites is presented, which suggests that it will be sufficient to monitor surface displacement inside the buildings.

CMS Collaboration	Measurement of the mass of the top quark in decays with a J/psi meson in pp collisions 8 Tev	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Top physics	LHC	A first measurement of the top quark mass in the decay channel t -> (W -> l nu)(b -> J/psi + X -> mu(+) + mu(-) + X) is presented. The analysis uses events selected from the proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb(-1), with 666 t (t) over bar and single top quark candidate events containing a reconstructed J/psi candidate decaying into an oppositely-charged muon pair. The mass of the (J/psi + l) system, where l is an electron or a muon from W boson decay, is used to extract a top quark mass of 173.5 +/- 3.0 (stat) +/- 0.9 (syst) GeV.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

Rev. Lett. 116 061102). In the final 0.2 s (about 8 gravitational-wave cycles) before the amplitude reached its maximum, the observed signal swept up in amplitude and frequency, from 35 Hz to 150 Hz. The theoretical gravitational-wave signal for merging black holes, as predicted by general relativity, can be computed only by full numerical relativity, because analytic approximations fail near the time of merger. Moreover, the nearly-equal masses, moderate spins, and small number of orbits of GW150914 are especially straightforward and efficient to simulate with modern numerical-relativity codes. In this paper, we report the modeling of GW150914 with numerical-relativity simulations, using black-hole masses and spins consistent with those inferred from LIGO's measurement (Abbott et al LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 241102). In particular, we employ two independent numerical-relativity codes that use completely different analytical and numerical methods to model the same merging black holes and to compute the emitted gravitational waveform; we find excellent agreement between the waveforms produced by the two independent codes. These results demonstrate the validity, impact, and potential of current and future studies using rapid-response, targeted numerical-relativity simulations for better understanding gravitational-wave observations.

Effect of sequence dispersity on morphology of tapered diblock copolymers from molecular dynamics simulations	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; POLYETHYLENE POLYSTYRENE BLENDS; MULTICOMPONENT POLYMER SYSTEMS; BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; GRADIENT COPOLYMERS; PHASE-BEHAVIOR; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; TRIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; ARCHITECTURE	Tapered diblock copolymers are similar to typical AB diblock copolymers but have an added transition region between the two blocks which changes gradually in composition from pure A to pure B. This tapered region can be varied from 0% (true diblock) to 100% (gradient copolymer) of the polymer length, and this allows some control over the microphase separated domain spacing and other material properties. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of linearly tapered block copolymers with tapers of various lengths, initialized from fluids density functional theory predictions. To investigate the effect of sequence dispersity, we compare systems composed of identical polymers, whose taper has a fixed sequence that most closely approximates a linear gradient, with sequentially disperse polymers, whose sequences are created statistically to yield the appropriate ensemble average linear gradient. Especially at high segregation strength, we find clear differences in polymer conformations and microstructures between these systems. Importantly, the statistical polymers are able to find more favorable conformations given their sequence, for instance, a statistical polymer with a larger fraction of A than the median will tend towards the A lamellae. The conformations of the statistically different polymers can thus be less stretched, and these systems have higher overall density. Consequently, the lamellae formed by statistical polymers have smaller domain spacing with sharper interfaces. Published by AIP Publishing.

Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation into the reductive coupling of CO, which provides new fundamental insights into a multielectron bond-breaking and bond-making transformation. In our studies, the formation of a bis(siloxycarbyne) complex precedes C-O bond cleavage. At -78 degrees C, over days, C-C coupling occurs without C-O cleavage. However, upon warming to 0 degrees C, C-O cleavage is observed from this bis(siloxycarbyne) complex. A siloxycarbyne/CO species undergoes C-O bond cleavage at lower temperatures, indicating that monosilylation, and a more electron-rich Mo center, favors deoxygenative pathways. From the bis(siloxycarbyne), isotopic labeling experiments and kinetics are consistent with a mechanism involving unimolecular silyl loss or C-O cleavage as rate-determining steps toward carbide formation. Reduction of Mo(IV) CO adducts of carbide and silylcarbyne species allowed for the spectroscopic detection of reduced silylcarbyne/CO and mixed silylcarbyne/siloxycarbyne complexes, respectively. Upon warming, both of these silylcarbynes undergo C-C bond formation, releasing silylated C2O1 fragments and demonstrating that the multiple bonded terminal Mo C moiety is an intermediate on the path to deoxygenated, C-C coupled products. The electronic structures of Mo carbide and carbyne species were investigated quantum mechanically. Overall, the present studies establish the elementary reactions steps by which CO is cleaved and coupled at a single metal site.

The Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) is the primary activity within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - phase 6 (CMIP6) focusing on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In this paper, we describe the framework for ISMIP6 and its relationship with other activities within CMIP6. The ISMIP6 experimental design relies on CMIP6 climate models and includes, for the first time within CMIP, coupled ice-sheet-climate models as well as standalone ice-sheet models. To facilitate analysis of the multi-model ensemble and to generate a set of standard climate inputs for standalone ice-sheet models, ISMIP6 defines a protocol for all variables related to ice sheets. ISMIP6 will provide a basis for investigating the feedbacks, impacts, and sea-level changes associated with dynamic ice sheets and for quantifying the uncertainty in ice-sheet-sourced global sea-level change.

These standards are different from previously established requirements for detection and waveform parameter measurement based on signal-to-noise optimization. We present convenient formulas for evaluating and interpreting the contribution of model errors to measured values of this chi(2) statistic. The new accuracy standards derived here are needed to ensure the reliability of measured values of the Allen chi(2) statistic, both in their traditional role as vetoes and in their current role as elements in evaluating the significance of candidate detections.

THE HIGH-RESOLUTION INFRARED SPECTRUM OF HCl+	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						ISM: molecules; methods: laboratory: molecular; molecular data; techniques: spectroscopic	INTERSTELLAR CHLORONIUM; LINE CATALOG; SUBMILLIMETER; MILLIMETER	The chloroniumyl cation, HCl+, has been recently identified in space from Herschel's spectra. A joint analysis of extensive vis-UV spectroscopy emission data together with a few high-resolution and high-accuracy millimeter-wave data provided the necessary rest frequencies to support the astronomical identification. Nevertheless, the analysis did not include any infrared (IR) vibration-rotation data. Furthermore, with the end of the Herschel mission, IR observations from the ground may be one of the few available means to further study this ion in space. In this work, we provide a set of accurate rovibrational transition wavenumbers, as well as a new and improved global fit of vis-UV, IR, and millimeter-wave spectroscopy laboratory data, that will aid in future studies of this molecule.

IC 3639-A NEW BONA FIDE COMPTON-THICK AGN UNVEILED BY NuSTAR	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: active; galaxies: nuclei; galaxies: Seyfert; techniques: spectroscopic; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: individual (IC 3639)	ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI; X-RAY-EMISSION; SUBARCSECOND MIDINFRARED VIEW; K-ALPHA EMISSION; XMM-NEWTON; MU-M; EXTREME ABSORPTION; SEYFERT-GALAXIES; IRON LINES; BLACK-HOLE	We analyze high-quality NuSTAR observations of the local (z = 0.011) Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 3639, in conjunction with archival Suzaku and Chandra data. This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of the source, spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray observations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration on the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray energy coverage of NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing models, enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of the source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an obscuring column in excess of 3.6 x 10(24) cm(-2), unconstrained at the upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of log(10) (L2-10keV[erg s(-1)] = 43.4(-1.1)(+0.6) to 90% confidence, almost 400 times the observed flux, and consistent with various multiwavelength diagnostics. Such a high ratio of intrinsic to observed flux, in addition to an Fe-K alpha fluorescence line equivalent width exceeding 2 keV, is extreme among known bona fide CTK AGNs, which we suggest are both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639. Our study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modeling with NuSTAR enables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly and emphasizes the need for improved modeling of AGN tori showing intense iron fluorescence.

NEAR-INFRARED POLARIMETRY AND THE NON-UNIFORM ENVELOPE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Galaxy: disk; ISM: individual objects (L1544); ISM: magnetic fields; magnetic fields; polarization; techniques: polarimetric	POLARIZATION SURVEY GPIPS; CLERK MAXWELL TELESCOPE; OH-ZEEMAN OBSERVATIONS; MOLECULAR CLOUD CORES; STAR-FORMATION; DARK CLOUDS; AMBIPOLAR-DIFFUSION; DENSE CORES; INTERSTELLAR CLOUDS; PRESTELLAR CORES	The magnetic field (B-field) of the starless dark cloud L1544 has been studied using near-infrared (NIR) background starlight polarimetry (BSP) and archival data in order to characterize the properties of the plane-of-sky B-field. NIR linear polarization measurements of over 1700 stars were obtained in the H band and 201 of these were also measured in the K band. The NIR BSP properties are correlated with reddening, as traced using the Rayleigh-Jeans color excess (H-M) method, and with thermal dust emission from the L1544 cloud and envelope seen in Herschel maps. The NIR polarization position angles change at the location of the cloud and exhibit their lowest dispersion there, offering strong evidence that NIR polarization traces the plane-of-sky B-field of L1544. In this paper, the uniformity of the plane-of-sky B-field in the envelope region of L1544 is quantitatively assessed. This allows evaluation of the approach of assuming uniform field geometry when measuring relative mass-to-flux ratios in the cloud envelope and core based on averaging of the radio Zeeman observations in the envelope, as done by Crutcher et al. In L1544, the NIR BSP shows the envelope B-field to be significantly non-uniform and likely not suitable for averaging Zeeman properties without treating intrinsic variations. Deeper analyses of the NIR BSP and related data sets, including estimates of the B-field strength and testing how it varies with position and gas density, are the subjects of later papers in this series.

HERSCHEL OBSERVATIONS AND UPDATED SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS OF FIVE SUNLIKE STARS WITH DEBRIS DISKS	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						circumstellar matter; infrared: planetary systems; stars: individual (eta Cru, HD 33636, HD 50554, HD 52265)	SPITZER INFRARED SPECTROGRAPH; COLLISIONAL CASCADES; RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; EPSILON-ERIDANI; KUIPER-BELT; DUST; PLANET; SIZE; CATALOG; HUBBLE	Observations from the Herschel Space Observatory have more than doubled the number of wide debris disks orbiting Sunlike stars to include over 30 systems with R > 100 AU. Here we present new Herschel PACS and re-analyzed Spitzer MIPS photometry of five Sunlike stars with wide debris disks, from Kuiper belt size to R > 150 AU. The disk surrounding HD 105211 is well resolved, with an angular extent of >14" along the major axis, and the disks of HD 33636, HD 50554, and HD 52265 are extended beyond the PACS PSF size (50% of energy enclosed within radius 4.23"). HD 105211 also has a 24 mu m infrared excess that was previously overlooked because of a poorly constrained photospheric model. Archival Spitzer IRS observations indicate that the disks have small grains of minimum radius a(min) similar to 3 mu m, although the a(min) is larger than the radiation pressure blowout size in all systems. If modeled as single-temperature blackbodies, the disk temperatures would all be <60 K. Our radiative transfer models predict actual disk radii approximately twice the radius of model blackbody disks. We find that the Herschel photometry traces dust near the source population of planetesimals. The disk luminosities are in the range 2 x 10(-5) <= L/L-circle dot <= 2 x 10(-4) , consistent with collisions in icy planetesimal belts stirred by Pluto-size dwarf planets.

This idea has not yielded much practical success, presumably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance measurements. We have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with The. Cannon, which has now delivered 15 individual abundances for similar to 10(5) stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions around 0.04. dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The. Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space, and we. recover some known phase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures at the survey-scale by blind search purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance measurements delivered by The. Cannon; the prospects for future data sets appear very good.

WAVELENGTH-DEPENDENT VARIABILITY OF ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI IN THE PAN-STARRS1 MEDIUM DEEP SURVEY	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; black hole physics; galaxies: nuclei; surveys; ultraviolet: general	DIGITAL SKY SURVEY; DOMINATED ACCRETION DISKS; SPECTRAL VARIABILITY; COLOR VARIABILITY; DATA RELEASE; BLACK-HOLE; ULTRAVIOLET; CONSTRAINTS; SELECTION; QUASARS	We analyze the wavelength-dependent variability of a sample of spectroscopically confirmed active galactic nuclei selected from near-UV (NUV) variable sources in the GALEX Time Domain Survey that have a large amplitude of optical variability (difference-flux S/N > 3) in the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS). By matching GALEX and PS1 epochs in five bands (NUV, g(P1), r(P1), i(P1), z(P1)) in time, and taking their flux difference, we create co-temporal difference-flux spectral energy distributions (Delta f SEDs) using two chosen epochs for each of the 23 objects in our sample, on timescales of about a year. We confirm the "bluer-when-brighter" trend reported in previous studies, and measure a median spectral index of the Df SEDs of alpha(lambda) = 2.1 that is consistent with an accretion disk spectrum. We further fit the Delta f SEDs of each source with a standard accretion disk model in which the accretion rate changes from one epoch to the other. In our sample, 17 out of 23 (similar to 74%) sources are described well by this variable accretion-rate disk model, with a median average characteristic disk temperature (T) over bar* of 1.2 x 10(5) K that is consistent with the temperatures expected, given the distribution of accretion rates and black hole masses inferred for the sample. Our analysis also shows that the variable accretion rate model is a better fit to the Delta f SEDs than a simple power law.

These lines are important coolants of both the neutral and the ionized medium, and probe multiple phases of the ISM. In the framework of the halo model, we compute predictions of the three-dimensional power spectra for two different surveys, showing that they have the required sensitivity to detect cross-power spectra between the [C II] line and both the [O I] line and the [N II] lines with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The importance of cross-correlating multiple lines with the intensity mapping technique is twofold. On the one hand, we will have multiple probes of the different phases of the ISM, which is key to understanding the interplay between energetic sources, and the gas and dust at high redshift. This kind of study will be useful for a next-generation space observatory such as the NASA Far-IR Surveyor, which will probe the global star formation and the ISM of galaxies from the peak of star formation to the epoch of reionization. On the other hand, emission lines from external galaxies are an important foreground when measuring spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background spectrum with future space-based experiments like PIXIE; measuring fluctuations in the intensity mapping regime will help constrain the mean amplitude of these lines, and will allow us to better handle this important foreground.

We detect 8 Type Ia and 36 core-collapse SNe. All Type. Ia/Ibc SNe. become undetectable within three. years of explosion, whereas 22 +/- 11% of Type. II SNe. continue to be detected. Five Type. II SNe are detected even two decades after discovery (SN 1974E, 1979C, 1980K, 1986J, and 1993J). Warm dust luminosity, temperature, and a lower limit on mass are obtained by fitting the two IRAC bands, assuming an optically thin dust shell. We derive warm dust masses between 10(-6) and 10(-2) M-circle dot and dust color temperatures between 200 and 1280 K. This observed warm dust could be pre-existing or newly created, but in either case represents a lower limit to the dust mass because cooler dust may be present. We present three case studies of extreme SNe.. SN 2011ja (II-P) was over-luminous ([4.5] = -15.6 mag) at 900 days post explosion with increasing hot dust mass, suggesting either an episode of dust formation or intensifying circumstellar material (CSM) interactions heating up pre-existing dust. SN 2014bi (II-P) showed a factor of 10 decrease in dust mass over one month, suggesting either dust destruction or reduced dust heating. The IR luminosity of SN 2014C (Ib) stayed. constant over 800 days, possibly due to strong CSM interaction with an. H-rich shell, which is rare among stripped-envelope SNe. The observations suggest that this CSM shell originated from an LBV-like eruption roughly 100 years pre-explosion. The observed diversity demonstrates the power of mid-IR observations of a large sample of SNe.

During three separate campaigns, we obtained Herschel data for 24 stars at 70, 100, and 160 mu m. We chose stars that were already known or suspected to have circumstellar dust based on excess infrared (IR) emission previously measured with the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) or Spitzer and used Herschel to examine long-wavelength properties of the dust. Fifteen stars were found to be uncontaminated by background sources and possess IR emission most likely due to a circumstellar debris disk. We analyzed the properties of these debris disks to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for dust production and removal. Seven targets were spatially resolved in the Herschel images. Based on fits to their spectral energy distributions, nine disks appear to have two temperature components. Of these nine, in three cases, the warmer dust component is likely the result of a transient process rather than a steady-state collisional cascade. The dust belts at four stars are likely stirred by an unseen planet and merit further investigation.

DISK-WIND CONNECTION DURING THE HEARTBEATS OF GRS 1915+105	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						accretion, accretion disks; instabilities; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual (GRS 1915+105)	DOMINATED ACCRETION DISKS; BLACK-HOLE SPIN; TIMING-EXPLORER OBSERVATIONS; X-RAY BINARIES; RADIATION PRESSURE; UNIFIED MODEL; REFLECTION; INSTABILITY; SPECTRA; MASS	Disk and wind signatures are seen in the soft state of Galactic black holes, while the jet is seen in the hard state. Here we study the disk-wind connection in the rho class of variability in GRS 1915+105 using a joint NuSTAR-Chandra observation. The source shows 50 s limit cycle oscillations. By including new information provided by the reflection spectrum. and using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we find that the change in the inner disk inferred from the blackbody emission is not matched by reflection measurements. The latter is almost constant, independent of the continuum model. The two radii are comparable only if the disk temperature color correction factor changes, an effect that could be due to the changing opacity of the disk caused by changes in metal abundances. The disk inclination is similar to that inferred from the jet axis, and oscillates by similar to 10 degrees. The simultaneous Chandra data show the presence of two wind components with velocities between 500 and 5000 km s(-1), and possibly two more with velocities reaching 20,000 km s(-1) (similar to 0.06 c). The column densities are similar to 5 x 10(22) cm(-2). An upper limit to the wind response time of 2 s is measured, implying a launch radius of < 6 x 10(10) cm. The changes in wind velocity and absorbed flux require the geometry of the wind to change during the oscillations, constraining the wind to be launched from a distance of 290-1300 r(g) from the black hole. Both data sets support fundamental model predictions in which a bulge originates in the inner disk and moves outward as the instability progresses.	[Zoghbi, Abderahmen; Miller, J.

We find that colitis caused by functional deficiency of Treg cells leads to altered expansion and reduced function of MDSCs. During differentiation of MDSCs in vitro from bone marrow cells, Treg cells enhanced MDSC function and controlled their differentiation through a mechanism involving transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta-deficient Treg cells were not able to regulate MDSC function in an experimentally induced model of colitis. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of TGF-beta-mediated in-vitro-differentiated MDSCs on colitis. Adoptive transfer of MDSCs that differentiated with TGF-beta led to better colitis prevention than the transfer of MDSCs that differentiated without TGF-beta. Our results demonstrate an interaction between Treg cells and MDSCs that contributes to the regulation of MDSC proliferation and the acquisition of immunosuppressive functions.

Diamond is also rich in optically active defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers, which behave as atom-like systems in the solid state. Predictions and observations of coherent coupling of the NV electronic spin to phonons via lattice strain have motivated the development of diamond nanomechanical devices aimed at the realization of hybrid quantum systems in which phonons provide an interface with diamond spins. In this work, we demonstrate diamond optomechanical crystals (OMCs), a device platform to enable such applications, wherein the co-localization of similar to 200 THz photons and few to 10 GHz phonons in a quasi-periodic diamond nanostructure leads to coupling of an optical cavity field to a mechanical mode via radiation pressure. In contrast to other material systems, diamond OMCs operating in the resolved-sideband regime possess large intracavity photon capacities (> 10(5)) and sufficient optomechanical coupling rates to reach a cooperativity of similar to 20 at room temperature, allowing for the observation of optomechanically induced transparency and the realization of large-amplitude optomechanical self-oscillations.

However, for seismic excitation, where energy is mostly carried by surface waves, energy reflection and redirection might lead to harming surrounding regions. Here, we propose a seismic metabarrier able to convert seismic Rayleigh waves into shear bulk waves that propagate away from the soil surface. The metabarrier is realized by burying sub-wavelength resonant structures under the soil surface. Each resonant structure consists of a cylindrical mass suspended by elastomeric springs within a concrete case and can be tuned to the resonance frequency of interest. The design allows controlling seismic waves with wavelengths from 10-to-100 m with meter-sized resonant structures. We develop an analytical model based on effective medium theory able to capture the mode conversion mechanism. The model is used to guide the design of metabarriers for varying soil conditions and validated using finite-element simulations. We investigate the shielding performance of a metabarrier in a scaled experimental model and demonstrate that surface ground motion can be reduced up to 50% in frequency regions below 10 Hz, relevant for the protection of buildings and civil infrastructures.

Keck Array Bicep2 Collaborations	BICEP2/KECK ARRAY VIII: MEASUREMENT OF GRAVITATIONAL LENSING FROM LARGE-SCALE B-MODE POLARIZATION	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cosmic background radiation; cosmology: observations; gravitational lensing: weak; polarization	MICROWAVE; CMB; RECONSTRUCTION; MASS	We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 GHz maps, which include all data taken by the BICEP2 and Keck Array Cosmic Microwave Background polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest angular resolution (similar to 0 degrees.5), the excellent sensitivity (similar to 3 mu K-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the lensing potential using only information at larger angular scales (l <= 700). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential, we measure an amplitude of the spectrum to be A(L)(phi phi) = 1.15 +/- 0.36 (Planck CDM prediction corresponds to A(L)(phi phi) = 1) and reject the no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8s, which is the highest significance achieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields A(L)(phi phi) = 1.13 +/- 0.20. These direct measurements of A(L)(phi phi) are consistent with the CDM cosmology and with that derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum (A(L)(BB) = 1.20 +/- 0.17). We perform a series of null tests and consistency checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the B modes previously reported by BICEP / Keck at intermediate angular scales (150 less than or similar to l less than or similar to 350) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any alternative cosmological sources of B modes at these angular scales.

THE AFTERGLOW AND EARLY-TYPE HOST GALAXY OF THE SHORT GRB 150101B AT z=0.1343	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma-ray burst: individual (150101B)	GAMMA-RAY BURST; COMPACT OBJECT MERGERS; NEUTRON-STAR SYSTEMS; LIGHT CURVES; OPTICAL AFTERGLOW; EXTENDED EMISSION; POWERED EMISSION; JET BREAKS; PROGENITOR; REDSHIFT	We present the discovery of the X-ray and optical afterglows of the short-duration GRB 150101B, pinpointing the event to an early-type host galaxy at z = 0.1343 +/- 0.0030. This makes GRB 150101B the most nearby short gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an early-type host galaxy discovered to date. Fitting the spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy results in an inferred stellar mass of approximate to 7 x 10(10) M-circle dot, stellar population age of approximate to 2-2.5 Gyr, and star formation rate of less than or similar to 0.4M(circle dot) yr(-1). The host of GRB 150101B is one of the largest and most luminous short GRB host galaxies, with a B-band luminosity of approximate to 4.3L(*) and half-light radius of approximate to 8 kpc. GRB 150101B is located at a projected distance of 7.35 +/- 0.07. kpc from its host center and lies on a faint region of its host rest-frame optical light. Its location, combined with the lack of associated supernova, is consistent with an NS-NS/NS-BH merger progenitor. From modeling the evolution of the broadband afterglow, we calculate isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of approximate to 1.3 x 10(49) erg and approximate to(6-14) x 10(51) erg, respectively, a circumburst density of approximate to(0.8-4) x 10(-5) cm(-3), and a jet opening angle of greater than or similar to 9 degrees. Using observations extending to approximate to 30 days, we place upper limits of less than or similar to(2-4) x 10(41) erg s(-1) on associated kilonova emission. We compare searches following previous short GRBs to existing kilonova models and demonstrate the difficulty of performing effective kilonova searches from cosmological short GRBs using current ground-based facilities. We show that at the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO horizon distance of 200 Mpc, searches reaching depths of approximate to 23-24 AB. mag are necessary to probe a meaningful range of kilonova models.

We utilize the infrastructure we have built for the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. This includes the common disk initial conditions, common physics models (e. g., radiative cooling and UV background by the standardized package GRACKLE) and common analysis toolkit yt, all of which are publicly available. Subgrid physics models such as Jeans pressure floor, star formation, supernova feedback energy, and metal production are carefully constrained across code platforms. With numerical accuracy that resolves the disk scale height, we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in many dimensions including: gas and stellar surface densities, rotation curves, velocity dispersions, density and temperature distribution functions, disk vertical heights, stellar clumps, star formation rates, and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. Quantities such as velocity dispersions are very robust (agreement within a few tens of percent at all radii) while measures like newly formed stellar clump mass functions show more significant variation (difference by up to a factor of similar to 3). Systematic differences exist, for example, between mesh-based and particle-based codes in the low-density region, and between more diffusive and less diffusive schemes in the high-density tail of the density distribution. Yet intrinsic code differences are generally small compared to the variations in numerical implementations of the common subgrid physics such as supernova feedback. Our experiment reassures that, if adequately designed in accordance with our proposed common parameters, results of a modern high-resolution galaxy formation simulation are more sensitive to input physics than to intrinsic differences in numerical schemes.

Classical studies on yeast, and recently on bacteria, have identified rules for cell size regulation in single cells, but in the more complex environment of multicellular tissues, data have been lacking. In this study, to characterize cell size and growth regulation in a multicellular context, we developed a 4D imaging pipeline and applied it to track and quantify epidermal cells over 3-4 d in Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristems. We found that a cell size checkpoint is not the trigger for G2/ M or cytokinesis, refuting the unexamined assumption that meristematic cells trigger cell cycle phases upon reaching a critical size. Our data also rule out models in which cells undergo G2/ M at a fixed time after birth, or by adding a critical size increment between G2/ M transitions. Rather, cell size regulation was intermediate between the critical size and critical increment paradigms, meaning that cell size fluctuations decay by similar to 75% in one generation compared with 100% (critical size) and 50% (critical increment). Notably, this behavior was independent of local cell-cell contact topologies and of position within the tissue. Cells grew exponentially throughout the first >80% of the cell cycle, but following an asymmetrical division, the small daughter grew at a faster exponential rate than the large daughter, an observation that potentially challenges present models of growth regulation. These growth and division behaviors place strong constraints on quantitative mechanistic descriptions of the cell cycle and growth control.

A linearized porous brittle damage material model with distributed frictional-cohesive faults	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY			English	Article						Brittle damage; Multiscale modelling; Recursive faulting; Porous media; Hydraulic conductivity	VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; PERMEABILITY CHANGES; GRANITE; FLOW; DILATANCY; STRESS	We present a simplified model of damaging porous material, obtained through consistent linearization from a recursive-faulting material model described in (Pandolfi et al. 2016). The brittle damage material model is characterized by special planar micro-structures, consisting of nested families of equi-spaced frictional cohesive faults in an otherwise elastic matrix material. The linear kinematics model preserves the main microstructural features of the finite kinematics one but offers a far better computational performance. Unlike models commonly employed in geo-mechanical applications, the proposed model contains a small number of parameters, to wit, two elastic moduli, three frictional-cohesive parameters, and three hydraulic response parameters, all of which having clear physical meanings and amenable to direct experimental measurement through standard material tests. The model is validated by comparison to triaxial hydro mechanical experimental data. Despite the paucity of material constants, the salient aspects of the observed behavior are well captured by the model, qualitatively and quantitatively. As an example of application of the model, we simulate the excavation of a borehole in a rocky embankment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[De Bellis, M.

CMS Collaboration	Search for dark matter particles in proton-proton collisions at root 8 = TeV using the razor variables	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Supersymmetry	MODEL; EXTENSION; GALAXIES; CLUSTERS	A search for dark matter particles directly produced in proton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC is presented. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 fb(-1), at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The event selection requires at least two jets and no isolated leptons. The razor variables are used to quantify the transverse momentum balance in the jet momenta. The study is performed separately for events with and without jets originating from b quarks. The observed yields are consistent with the expected backgrounds and, depending on the nature of the production mechanism, dark matter production at the LHC is excluded at 90% confidence level for a mediator mass scale I > below 1 TeV. The use of razor variables yields results that complement those previously published.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

Timing of optical maturation of recently exposed material on Ceres	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Ceres; maturation; crater; weathering; age	CASSINI-VIMS; SURFACE; CHRONOLOGY; RAY	On Ceres, multispectral imaging data from the Dawn spacecraft show a distinct bluish characteristic for recently exposed material from the subsurface in, for example, crater ejecta. Ejecta blankets of presumably old craters show a more reddish spectrum. We selected areas in which fresh material from the Cerean subsurface was exposed at a specific time in the past, and no later geologic process is expected to have changed its surface composition or its cratering record. For each area, we determined two color ratios and the crater retention age. The measured color ratios show an exponential diminishment of the bluish characteristic over time. Although the cause of the color change remains uncertain, the time-dependent change in spectral properties is evident, which could help identify the process.

High-accuracy measurements of total column water vapor from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						OCO-2; water vapor; TCWV; remote sensing; hyperspectral; near-infrared	RESOLUTION IMAGING SPECTRORADIOMETER; RETRIEVAL; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; MODIS; OCO-2; SPECTROMETER; PERFORMANCE; HUMIDITY; NETWORK	Accurate knowledge of the distribution of water vapor in Earth's atmosphere is of critical importance to both weather and climate studies. Here we report on measurements of total column water vapor (TCWV) from hyperspectral observations of near-infrared reflected sunlight over land and ocean surfaces from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). These measurements are an ancillary product of the retrieval algorithm used to measure atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, with information coming from three highly resolved spectral bands. Comparisons to high-accuracy validation data, including ground-based GPS and microwave radiometer data, demonstrate that OCO-2 TCWV measurements have maximum root-mean-square deviations of 0.9-1.3mm. Our results indicate that OCO-2 is the first space-based sensor to accurately and precisely measure the two most important greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide, at high spatial resolution (1.3 x 2.3 km(2)) and that OCO-2 TCWV measurements may be useful in improving numerical weather predictions and reanalysis products.

Cryogenic flow features on Ceres: Implications for crater-related cryovolcanism	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						cryovolcanism; impact melt; dwarf planet Ceres; subsurface materials; flow features; coefficient of friction	LIQUID-WATER; ORIGIN; AVALANCHES; GANYMEDE; MISSION; STATE; VESTA	Craters on Ceres, such as Haulani, Kupalo, Ikapati, and Occator show postimpact modification by the deposition of extended plains material with pits, multiple lobate flows, and widely dispersed deposits that form a diffuse veneer on the preexisting surface. Bright material units in these features have a negative spectral slope in the visible range, making it appear bluish with respect to the grey-toned overall surface of Ceres. We calculate the drop height-to-runout length ratio of several flow features and obtain a coefficient of friction of<0.1: The results imply higher flow efficiency for flow features on Ceres than for similar features on other planetary bodies with similar gravity, suggesting low-viscosity material. The special association of flow features with impact craters could either point to an impact melt origin or to an exogenic triggering of cryovolcanic processes.

Search for dark matter inproton-proton collisions at 8 TeV with missing transverse momentum and vector boson tagged jets	JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS			English	Article						Dark matter; Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)	PARTICLES; GALAXIES; HIGGS	A search is presented for an excess of events with large missing transverse momentum in association with at least one highly energetic jet, in a data sample of protonproton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb(-1) collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results are interpreted using a set of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is achieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a hadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of 80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS analysis using the same data set. No significant excess with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are placed on the parameter space of the simplified models. Mediator masses between 80 and 400 GeV in the scalar and pseudoscalar models, and up to 1.5 TeV in the vector and axial vector models, are excluded.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

MINOS Collaboration	Constraints on large extra dimensions from the MINOS experiment	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							NEUTRINO OSCILLATIONS; MASS	We report new constraints on the size of large extra dimensions from data collected by the MINOS experiment between 2005 and 2012. Our analysis employs a model in which sterile neutrinos arise as Kaluza-Klein states in large extra dimensions and thus modify the neutrino oscillation probabilities due to mixing between active and sterile neutrino states. Using Fermilab's Neutrinos at the Main Injector beam exposure of 10.56 x 10(20) protons on target, we combine muon neutrino charged current and neutral current data sets from the Near and Far Detectors and observe no evidence for deviations from standard three-flavor neutrino oscillations. The ratios of reconstructed energy spectra in the two detectors constrain the size of large extra dimensions to be smaller than 0.45 mu m at 90% C.L. in the limit of a vanishing lightest active neutrino mass. Stronger limits are obtained for nonvanishing masses.	[Anghel, I.; Aurisano, A.; Goodman, M. C.; Paley, J.; Phan-Budd, S.; Sanchez, M. C.; Schreiner, P.; Talaga, R.

We found that solution-synthesized Pt/NiO core/shell nanowires can be converted into PtNi alloy nanowires through a thermal annealing process and then transformed into jagged Pt nanowires via electrochemical dealloying. The jagged nanowires exhibit an ECSA of 118 square meters per gram of Pt and a specific activity of 11.5 milliamperes per square centimeter for ORR 9 (at 0.9 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), yielding a mass activity of 13.6 amperes per milligram of Pt, nearly double previously reported best values. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations suggest that highly stressed, undercoordinated rhombus-rich surface configurations of the jagged nanowires enhance ORR activity versus more relaxed surfaces.

Dissolution of nontronite in chloride brines and implications for the aqueous history of Mars	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Mars; Nontronite; Clay minerals; Dissolution; Brines; Habitability; Chlorides	KAOLINITE DISSOLUTION; MONTMORILLONITE DISSOLUTION; PRECIPITATION KINETICS; SILICATE MINERALS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; PH; WATER; DEPENDENCE; PRESSURE; RATES	Increasing evidence suggests the presence of recent liquid water, including brines, on Mars. Brines have therefore likely impacted clay minerals such as the Fe-rich mineral nontronite found in martian ancient terrains. To interpret these interactions, we conducted batch experiments to measure the apparent dissolution rate constant of nontronite at 25.0 degrees C at activities of water (aH(2)O) of 1.00 (0.01 M CaCl2 or NaCl), 0.75 (saturated NaCl or 3.00 mol kg x 1 CaCl2), and 0.50 (5.00 mol kg x 1 CaCl2). Experiments at aH(2)O = 1.00 (0.01 M CaCl2) were also conducted at 4.0 C, 25.0 C, and 45.0 degrees C to measure an apparent activation energy for the dissolution of nontronite. Apparent dissolution rate constants at 25.0 degrees C in CaCl2-containing solutions decrease with decreasing activity of water as follows: 1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 1.00) > 2.36 x 10(-13) +/- 3.1 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.75) > 2.05 x 10(-14) +/- 2.9 x 10(-15) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.50). Similar results were observed at 25.0 degrees C in NaCl-containing solutions: 1.89 x 10(-12) +/- 1 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 1.00) > 1.98 x 10(-13) +/- 2.3 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (aH(2)O = 0.75). This decrease in apparent dissolution rate constants with decreasing activity of water follows a relationship of the form: log k(diss) = 3.70 +/- 0.20 x aH(2)O x 15.49, where k(diss) is the apparent dissolution rate constant, and aH(2)O is the activity of water. The slope of this relationship (3.70 x 0.20) is within uncertainty of that of other minerals where the relationship between dissolution rates and activity of water has been tested, including forsteritic olivine (log R = 3.27 +/- 0.91 x aH(2)O x 11.00) (Olsen et al., 2015) and jarosite (log R = 3.85 +/- 0.43 x aH(2)O-12.84) (Dixon et al., 2015), where R is the mineral dissolution rate. This result allows prediction of mineral dissolution as a function of activity of water and suggests that with decreasing activity of water, mineral dissolution will decrease due to the role of water as a ligand in the reaction. Apparent dissolution rate constants in the dilute NaCl solution (1.89 x 10(-12) +/- 1 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1)) are slightly greater than those in the dilute CaCl2 solutions (1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1)). We attribute this effect to the exchange of Na with Ca in the nontronite interlayer. An apparent activation energy of 54.6 +/- 1.0 kJ/mol was calculated from apparent dissolution rate constants in dilute CaCl2-containing solutions at temperatures of 4.0 degrees C, 25.0 degrees C, and 45.0 C: 2.33 x 10(-13) +/- 1.3 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (4.0 degrees C), 1.18 x 10(-12) +/- 9 x 10(-14) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (25.0 degrees C), and 4.98 x 10(-12) +/- 3.8 x 10(-13) mol mineral m(-2) s(-1) (45.0 degrees C). The greatly decreased dissolution of nontronite in brines and at low temperatures suggests that any martian nontronite found to be perceptibly weathered may have experienced very long periods of water-rock interaction with brines at the low temperatures prevalent on Mars, with important implications for the paleoclimate and long-term potential habitability of Mars.

A new surface-based multi frequency (Ku-, X- and C-bands) microwave scatterometer system is used quasi-coincident with in situ geophysical snow measurements. A multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate the total co-polarized backscatter coefficient for two snow temperature conditions. The model provides the surface and volume scattering contributions for each snow layer, as well as the frequency-dependent penetration depth. These results aid interpretation of observed backscatter. Joint use of Ku-, X- and C-band microwaves provide an enhanced understanding of diverse variations in geophysical, thermodynamic and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. Our results indicate that the effect of dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers is the dominant factor affecting microwave penetration and backscatter from all three frequencies. The observed and modeled C band backscatter shows good agreement, followed by X- and Ku-bands, at both snow temperature conditions. Microwave backscatter shows greater sensitivity to variations in plot-scale surface roughness, for all three frequencies. Additionally, Ku-band wavelength exhibits greater sensitivity to snow grain radius, over X-, and C bands. Our results demonstrate the future potential of a multi-frequency approach towards the development of snow thickness and snow water equivalent algorithms on first-year sea ice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Dimensionless spectral vegetation index values derived from satellite imagery are commonly used to derive crop biomass. However, the highly empirical nature of spectrally derived biomass estimates requires frequent and costly calibration with manually collected ground data. Recently, low cost, autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanners (ATLSs) have become available for near-surface applications. In contrast to the dimensionless nature of spectral index values, autonomous light detection and ranging (lidar) technology measures physical vegetation structure by recording the x, y, z coordinates of canopy components at very high spatial (<10 cm), and temporal (<2 days) resolution. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of an ATLS to i) monitor crop growth dynamics and ii) calibrate satellite imagery for estimating crop biomass. Wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) growth was monitored by acquiring hypertemporal (every 28 h for a full growing season) ATLS data at three different field sites across a range of experimentally manipulated crop growth conditions. The ATLS-derived crop height explained nearly three-quarters of the variability in destructively sampled wheat biomass (r(2) = 0.74, RMSE = 514.20 kg ha(-1)), showing a slightly stronger correlation to crop biomass than did leaf area index (LAI) measurements collected in the field using a LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 546 kg ha(-1)). Satellite-based crop biomass estimates calibrated with ATLS data captured the variability in wheat biomass throughout a farm field with a biomass error of 730.96 and 727.60 kg ha(-1) (RMSE) during the jointing (Development stage: Zadoks 37) and heading (Development stage: Zadoks 50) growth stages, respectively. These findings suggest that the hypertemporal lidar information provided via ATLS technology could constitute a major step forward in operational monitoring and mapping of crop biomass.

ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						DORIS; GPS; South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA); Jason-2 satellite; Maule earthquake	ORBIT DETERMINATION; CORRECTIVE MODEL; SEA-LEVEL; GPS DATA; NETWORK; SERIES; TOPEX; ERROR	We analyzed time series of daily DORIS and GPS station coordinate estimates derived from Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The DORIS coordinates were estimated using Jason-2 precise orbits based on GPS data only, implying that the station positions from the two techniques are expressed in the same GPS-based terrestrial reference frame. Comparisons of 3-D vectors of such co-located stations show systematic biases in position around South America when compared to local geodetic ties. We conclude that these results could be explained by a sensitivity of the Jason-2/DORIS oscillator to radiation when the satellite passes over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The effect for Jason-2 manifests mainly as an offset in station coordinates, though there is also evidence of a drift at the start of the mission that diminishes in time. This contrasts with the experience on Jason-1, wherein large, persistent drifts were observed for stations in this same (SAA) region. The spurious drift is much (similar to 90%) smaller for Jason-2, which may be attributable to the steps taken prior to launch to harden the oscillator. Analysis of DORIS Doppler residuals may indicate some small degradation after 2009 for these stations. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Real-space mean-field theory of a spin-1 Bose gas in synthetic dimensions	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							EDGE STATES; QUANTUM; ATOMS	The internal degrees of freedom provided by ultracold atoms provide a route for realizing higher dimensional physics in systems with limited spatial dimensions. Nonspatial degrees of freedom in these systems are dubbed "synthetic dimensions." This connection is useful from an experimental standpoint but complicated by the fact that interactions alter the condensate ground state. Here we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study the ground-state properties of a spin-1 Bose gas under the combined influence of an optical lattice, spatially varying spin-orbit coupling, and interactions at the mean-field level. The associated phases depend on the sign of the spin-dependent interaction parameter and the strength of the spin-orbit field. We find "charge"- and spin-density-wave phases which are directly related to helical spin order in real space and affect the behavior of edge currents in the synthetic dimension. We determine the resulting phase diagram as a function of the spin-orbit coupling and spin-dependent interaction strength, considering both attractive (ferromagnetic) and repulsive (polar) spin-dependent interactions, and we provide a direct comparison of our results with the noninteracting case. Our findings are applicable to current and future experiments, specifically with Rb-87, Li-7, K-41, and Na-23.	[Hurst, Hilary M.; Wilson, Justin H.; Pixley, J.

The study presents the changing emission-socioeconomic features of each provinces as well. The results indicate that Chinese provincial aggregated CO2 emissions calculated by the apparent energy consumption and updated emissions factors are coincident with the national emissions estimated by the same approach, which are 12.69% smaller than the one calculated by the traditional approach and IPCC default emission factors. The provincial aggregated CO2 emissions increased from 3160 million tonnes in 2000 to 8583 million tonnes in 2012. During the period, Shandong province contributed most to national emissions accumulatively (with an average percentage of 10.35%), followed by Liaoning (6.69%), Hebei (6.69%) and Shanxi provinces (6.25%). Most of the CO2 emissions were from raw coal, which is primarily burned in the thermal power sector. The analyses of per capita emissions and emission intensity in 2012 indicates that provinces located in the northwest and north had higher per capita CO2 emissions and emission intensities than the central and southeast coastal regions. Understanding the emissions and emission-socioeconomic characteristics of different provinces is critical for developing mitigation strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Yet balancing economic gains and environmental consequences induced by trade is still hindered by a lack of quantification of these two factors, especially for the environmental problems those are more locally oriented, such as the atmospheric pollution. Based on an environmental input-output analysis for 2010, we contrast economic gains (value added) against atmospheric pollutant emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO.), primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC)) and the widely concerned CO2 emissions associated with international and interprovincial exports from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the most polluted area in China. Our results show that exports contributed 55-62% of BTH's production emissions and 54% of its total value added. BTH's large exports of metals and metal products, nonmetal mineral products, chemical and transportation and warehousing, generated a larger share of pollutant emissions (36-46% of BTH's total) than that of value added (17%) along the supply chain. Most of BTH's embodied emissions in exports go to neighboring provinces and the developed east coastal regions in China, although the economic returns are comparatively low. Among BTH, industrial production in Beijing and Tianjin lead to more pollutant emission than value added in Hebei, due to reliance on pollution-intensive product imports from Hebei. Our results call for refocusing and restructuring of BTH's industry and trade structures to balance the economic gains and environmental losses for each region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, cities are critical for implementing China's carbon emissions mitigation policies. In this study, we employ an input-output model to calculate consumption-based CO2 emissions for thirteen Chinese cities and find substantial differences between production- and consumption-based accounting in terms of both overall and per capita carbon emissions. Urban consumption not only leads to carbon emissions within a city's own boundaries but also induces emissions in other regions via interregional trade. In megacities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, approximately 70% of consumption-based emissions are imported from other regions. Annual per capita consumption-based emissions in the three megacities are 14, 12 and 10 tonnes of CO2 per person, respectively. Some medium-sized cities, such as Shenyang, Dalian and Ningbo, exhibit per capita emissions that resemble those in Tianjin. From the perspective of final use, capital formation is the largest contributor to consumption-based emissions at 32-65%. All thirteen cities are categorized by their trading patterns: five are production-based cities in which production-based emissions exceed consumption-based emissions, whereas eight are consumption-based cities, with the opposite emissions pattern. Moreover, production-based cities tend to become consumption-based as they undergo socioeconomic development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Markovian Entropy Measure for the Analysis of Calcium Activity Time Series	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DIFFERENTIATION; DECONVOLUTION; XENOPUS; SCALE	Methods to analyze the dynamics of calcium activity often rely on visually distinguishable features in time series data such as spikes, waves, or oscillations. However, systems such as the developing nervous system display a complex, irregular type of calcium activity which makes the use of such methods less appropriate. Instead, for such systems there exists a class of methods (including information theoretic, power spectral, and fractal analysis approaches) which use more fundamental properties of the time series to analyze the observed calcium dynamics. We present a new analysis method in this class, the Markovian Entropy measure, which is an easily implementable calcium time series analysis method which represents the observed calcium activity as a realization of a Markov Process and describes its dynamics in terms of the level of predictability underlying the transitions between the states of the process. We applied our and other commonly used calcium analysis methods on a dataset from Xenopus laevis neural progenitors which displays irregular calcium activity and a dataset from murine synaptic neurons which displays activity time series that are well-described by visually-distinguishable features. We find that the Markovian Entropy measure is able to distinguish between biologically distinct populations in both datasets, and that it can separate biologically distinct populations to a greater extent than other methods in the dataset exhibiting irregular calcium activity. These results support the benefit of using the Markovian Entropy measure to analyze calcium dynamics, particularly for studies using time series data which do not exhibit easily distinguishable features.

The current investigation focuses on the local conservation of passive scalar concentration fields and the ability of the large-eddy simulation (LES) method to observe the boundedness of passive scalar concentrations. In practice, as a result of numerical artifacts, this fundamental constraint is often violated with scalars exhibiting unphysical excursions. The present study characterizes passive-scalar excursions in LES of a shear flow and examines methods for diagnosis and assesment of the problem. The analysis of scalar-excursion statistics provides support of the main hypothesis of the current study that unphysical scalar excursions in LES result from dispersive errors of the convection-term discretization where the subgrid-scale model (SGS) provides insufficient dissipation to produce a sufficiently smooth scalar field. In the LES runs three parameters are varied: the discretization of the convection terms, the SGS model, and grid resolution. Unphysical scalar excursions decrease as the order of accuracy of non-dissipative schemes is increased, but the improvement rate decreases with increasing order of accuracy. Two SGS models are examined, the stretched-vortex and a constant-coefficient Smagorinsky. Scalar excursions strongly depend on the SGS model. The excursions are significantly reduced when the characteristic SGS scale is set to double the grid spacing in runs with the stretched-vortex model. The maximum excursion and volume fraction of excursions outside boundary values show opposite trends with respect to resolution. The maximum unphysical excursions increase as resolution increases, whereas the volume fraction decreases. The reason for the increase in the maximum excursion is statistical and traceable to the number of grid points (sample size) which increases with resolution. In contrast, the volume fraction of unphysical excursions decreases with resolution because the SGS models explored perform better at higher grid resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We demonstrate their potential as Schottky-barrier-free metal contacts to 2D semiconductors, providing a solution to the contact resistance problem in 2D electronics. On the basis of first principles calculations, we find that the surface chemistry strongly affects Fermi level of MXenes: 0 termination always increases the work function with respect to that of bare surface, OH always decreases it, whereas F exhibits either trend depending on the specific material. This phenomenon originates from the effect of surface dipoles, which together with the weak Fermi level pinning, enable Schottky-barrier-free hole (or electron) injection into 2D semiconductors through van der Waals junctions with some of the O-terminated (or all the OH-terminated) MXenes. Furthermore, we suggest synthetic routes to control surface terminations based on calculated formation energies. This study enhances understanding of the correlation between surface chemistry and electronic/transport properties of 2D materials, and also gives predictions for improving 2D electronics.

This relevance, due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide, is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH4 are continuing to increase, making CH4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH4 sources that overlap geographically, and from the destruction of CH4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties, we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle, and producing regular (similar to biennial) updates of the global methane budget. This consortium includes atmospheric physicists and chemists, biogeochemists of surface and marine emissions, and socio-economists who study anthropogenic emissions. Following Kirschke et al. (2013), we propose here the first version of a living review paper that integrates results of top-down studies (exploiting atmospheric observations within an atmospheric inverse-modelling framework) and bottom-up models, inventories and data-driven approaches (including process-based models for estimating land surface emissions and atmospheric chemistry, and inventories for anthropogenic emissions, data-driven extrapolations). For the 2003-2012 decade, global methane emissions are estimated by top-down inversions at 558 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 540-568. About 60% of global emissions are anthropogenic (range 50-65 %). Since 2010, the bottom-up global emission inventories have been closer to methane emissions in the most carbon-intensive Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP8.5) and higher than all other RCP scenarios. Bottom-up approaches suggest larger global emissions (736 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 596-884) mostly because of larger natural emissions from individual sources such as inland waters, natural wetlands and geological sources. Considering the atmospheric constraints on the top-down budget, it is likely that some of the individual emissions reported by the bottom-up approaches are overestimated, leading to too large global emissions. Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (similar to 64% of the global budget, <30 degrees N) as compared to mid (similar to 32 %, 30-60 degrees N) and high northern latitudes (similar to 4 %, 60-90 degrees N). Top-down inversions consistently infer lower emissions in China (similar to 58 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 51-72, -14 %) and higher emissions in Africa (86 TgCH(4) yr(-1), range 73-108, + 19 %) than bottom-up values used as prior estimates. Overall, uncertainties for anthropogenic emissions appear smaller than those from natural sources, and the uncertainties on source categories appear larger for top-down inversions than for bottom-up inventories and models. The most important source of uncertainty on the methane budget is attributable to emissions from wetland and other inland waters. We show that the wetland extent could contribute 30-40% on the estimated range for wetland emissions. Other priorities for improving the methane budget include the following: (i) the development of process-based models for inland-water emissions, (ii) the intensification of methane observations at local scale (flux measurements) to constrain bottom-up land surface models, and at regional scale (surface networks and satellites) to constrain top-down inversions, (iii) improvements in the estimation of atmospheric loss by OH, and (iv) improvements of the transport models integrated in top-down inversions.

Here we present a lensless digital holographic microscope approach that provides roughly 1.5 micron resolution in a compact, robust package suitable for remote deployment. High resolution is achieved by generating high numerical-aperture input beams with radial gradient-index rod lenses. The ability to detect and track prokaryotes was explored using bacterial strains of two different sizes. In the larger strain, a variety of motions were seen, while the smaller strain was used to demonstrate a detection capability down to micron scales.

U.). The image of the disk recorded in the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals three dark concentric rings that indicate the presence of dust depleted gaps at about 60, 100, and 160 A. U. from the central star. The maps of the (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, and (CO)-O-18 J = 2 - 1 emission do not show such structures but reveal a change in the slope of the radial intensity profile across the positions of the dark rings in the continuum image. By comparing the observations with theoretical models for the disk emission, we find that the density of CO molecules is reduced inside the middle and outer dust gaps. However, in the inner ring there is no evidence of CO depletion. From the measurements of the dust and gas densities, we deduce that the gas-to-dust ratio varies across the disk and, in particular, it increases by at least a factor 5 within the inner dust gap compared to adjacent regions of the disk. The depletion of both dust and gas suggests that the middle and outer rings could be due to the gravitational torque exerted by two Saturn-mass planets orbiting at 100 and 160 A. U. from the star. On the other hand, the inner dust gap could result from dust accumulation at the edge of a magnetorotational instability dead zone, or from dust opacity variations at the edge of the CO frost line. Observations of the dust emission at higher angular resolution and of molecules that probe dense gas are required to establish more precisely the origins of the dark rings observed in the HD 163296 disk.

THE ALMA SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY IN THE HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD: SEARCH FOR [C II] LINE AND DUST EMISSION IN 6 < z < 8 GALAXIES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: star formation; instrumentation:interferometers; submillimeter: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; SIMILAR-TO 7; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; REDSHIFT; CONTINUUM; GAS; STARBURST; STELLAR; CONSTRAINTS	We present a search for [C II] line and dust continuum emission from optical dropout galaxies at z > 6 using ASPECS, our Atacama Large Millimeter submillimeter Array Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra-deep Field (UDF). Our observations, which cover the frequency range of 212-272 GHz, encompass approximately the range of 6 < z < 8 for [C II] line emission and reach a limiting luminosity of L-[C II] similar to (1.6-2.5) x 10(8) L-circle dot.We identify 14 [C II] line emitting candidates in this redshift range with significances > 4.5 sigma, two of which correspond to blind detections with no optical counterparts. At this significance level, our statistical analysis shows that about 60% of our candidates are expected to be spurious. For one of our blindly selected [C II] line candidates, we tentatively detect the CO(6-5) line in our parallel 3 mm line scan. None of the line candidates are individually detected in the 1.2 mm continuum. A stack of all [C II] candidates results in a tentative detection with S-1.2 (mm) = 14 +/- 5 mu Jy. This implies a dust-obscured star-formation rate (SFR) of (3 +/- 1) M-circle dot yr(-1). We find that the two highest-SFR objects have candidate [C II] lines with luminosities that are consistent with the low-redshift L-[C II] versus SFR relation. The other candidates have significantly higher [C II] luminosities than expected from their UV-based SFR. At the current sensitivity, it is unclear whether the majority of these sources are intrinsically bright [C II] emitters, or spurious sources. If only one of our line candidates was real (a scenario greatly favored by our statistical analysis), we find a source density for [C II] emitters at 6 < z < 8 that is significantly higher than predicted by current models and some extrapolations from galaxies in the local universe.

Of a total of 1302 galaxies in the field, 56 have spectroscopic redshifts and correspondingly well-defined physical properties. Among these, 11 have infrared luminosities L-IR > 10(11) L-circle dot, i.e., a detection in CO emission was expected. Out of these, 7 are detected at various significance in CO, and 4 are undetected in CO emission. In the CO-detected sources, we find CO excitation conditions that are lower than those typically found in starburst/sub-mm galaxy/QSO environments. We use the CO luminosities (including limits for non-detections) to derive molecular gas masses. We discuss our findings in the context of previous molecular gas observations at high redshift (star formation law, gas depletion times, gas fractions): the CO-detected galaxies in the UDF tend to reside on the low-L-IR envelope of the scatter in the L-IR-L-CO' relation, but exceptions exist. For the CO-detected sources, we find an average depletion time of similar to 1 Gyr, with significant scatter. The average molecular-to-stellar mass ratio (M-H2/M-*) is consistent with earlier measurements of main-sequence galaxies at these redshifts, and again shows large variations among sources. In some cases, we also measure dust continuum emission. On average, the dust-based estimates of the molecular gas are a factor similar to 2-5x smaller than those based on CO. When we account for detections as well as non-detections, we find large diversity in the molecular gas properties of the high-redshift galaxies covered by ASPECS.

GENERATION OF HIGHLY INCLINED TRANS-NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS BY PLANET NINE	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						Kuiper Belt: general	SOLAR-SYSTEM; KUIPER-BELT; CHAOTIC CAPTURE; ORIGIN; PERTURBATIONS; INSTABILITY; EVOLUTION; ASTEROIDS; ORBITS; BODIES	The trans-Neptunian region of the solar system exhibits an intricate dynamical structure, much of which can be explained by an instability-driven orbital history of the giant planets. However, the origins of a highly inclined, and in certain cases retrograde, population of trans-Neptunian objects remain elusive within the framework of this evolutionary picture. In this work, we show that the existence of a distant, Neptune-like planet that resides on an eccentric and mildly inclined orbit fully accounts for the anomalous component the trans-Neptunian orbital distribution. Adopting the same parameters for Planet Nine as those previously invoked to explain the clustering of distant Kuiper Belt orbits in physical space, we carry out a series of numerical experiments that elucidate the physical process though which highly inclined Kuiper Belt objects with semimajor axes smaller than a < 100 au are generated. The identified dynamical pathway demonstrates that enigmatic members of the Kuiper Belt such as Drac and Niku are derived from the extended scattered disk of the solar system.

This study is based on galaxies that have been selected solely through their CO emission and not through any other property. In all of the redshift bins the ASPECS measurements reach the predicted "knee" of the CO luminosity function (around 5 x 10(9) K km s(-1) pc(2)). We find clear evidence of an evolution in the CO luminosity function with respect to z similar to 0, with more CO-luminous galaxies present at z similar to 2. The observed galaxies at z similar to 2 also appear more gas-rich than predicted by recent semi-analytical models. The comoving cosmic molecular gas density within galaxies as a function of redshift shows a drop by a factor of 3-10 from z similar to 2 to z similar to 0 (with significant error bars), and possibly a decline at z > 3. This trend is similar to the observed evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. The latter therefore appears to be at least partly driven by the increased availability of molecular gas reservoirs at the peak of cosmic star formation (z similar to 2).

Here we study the linear phase of the plasma instabilities that these pair beams drive. To this end, we calculate the linear growth rate of the beam-plasma and oblique instability in the electrostatic approximation in both the reactive and kinetic regimes, assuming a Maxwell-Jittner distribution for the pair beam. We reproduce the well-known reactive and kinetic growth rates for both the beam-plasma and oblique mode. We demonstrate for the oblique instability that there is a broad spectrum of unstable modes that grow at the maximum rate for a wide range of beam temperatures and wave-vector orientations relative to the beam. We also delineate the conditions for applicability for the reactive and kinetic regimes and find that the beam-plasma mode transitions to the reactive regime at a lower Lorentz factor than the oblique mode due to a combination of their different scalings and the anisotropy of the velocity dispersions. Applying these results to the ultrarelativistic e(+/-) beams from TeV blazars, we confirm that these beams are unstable to both the kinetic oblique mode and the reactive beam-plasma mode. These results are important in understanding how powerful plasma instabilities may sap the energy of the ultrarelativistic e(+/-) beams as they propagate through intergalactic space.

Space-based observations can produce highly sampled infrared light curves, but are often limited to total baselines of about 1 month due to the orientation of the spacecraft. Here we present observations of the Chameleon I cluster, whose low declination makes it observable by the Spitzer Space Telescope over a 200-day period. We observe 30 young stellar objects with a daily cadence to better sample variability on timescales of months. We find that such variability is common, occurring in similar to 80% of the detected cluster members. The change in [3.6]-[4.5] color over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for extinction and fluctuations in disk emission. With our high cadence and long baseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of magnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies, up to the boundaries of our 200-day survey. Such long timescales are difficult to explain with variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic field, which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks. The most likely explanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout the inner similar to 0.5 au of the disk, suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is highly dynamic.

Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass (M-*) of 10(8.5) M-circle dot in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the ratio of H beta-and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. The H beta-toFUV ratio of our sample increases with M-* and SFR. The median ratio is similar to 0.7 at M-* similar to 10(8.5) M-circle dot (or SFR similar to 0.5M(circle dot) yr(-1)) and increases to similar to 1 at M-* similar to 10(10) M-circle dot (or SFR similar to 10 M-circle dot yr(-1)). At M-* < 10(9.5) M-circle dot, our median H beta-to-FUV ratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M*, implying a redshift evolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic scales provides a plausible explanation for our results, and the importance of the burstiness increases as M* decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our H beta-to-FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete sample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal initial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are unable to plausibly explain our results.	[Guo, Yicheng; Faber, S.

Images of NGC 7027 were acquired at 6.3, 6.6, 11.1, 19.7, 24.2, 33.6, and 37.1 mu m using the Faint Object Infrared Camera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST). The observations reveal emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and warm dust (T-D similar to 90 K) from the illuminated inner edge of the molecular envelope surrounding the ionized gas and central star. The DustEM code was used to fit the spectral energy distribution of fluxes obtained by FORCAST and the archival infrared spectrum of NGC 7027 acquired by the Short Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS) on the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). Best-fit dust models provide a total dust mass of 5.8(-2.6)(+2.3) x 10(-3) M-circle dot, where carbonaceous large (a = 1.5 mu m) and very small (a similar to 12 angstrom) grains, and PAHs (3.1 angstrom < a < 12 angstrom) compose 96.5, 2.2, and 1.3% of the dust by mass, respectively. The 37 mu m optical depth map shows minima in the dust column density at regions in the envelope that are coincident with a previously identified collimated outflow from the central star. The optical depth minima are also spatially coincident with enhancements in the 6.2 mu m PAH feature, which is derived from the 6.3 and 6.6 mu m maps. We interpret the spatial anti-correlation of the dust optical depth and PAH 6.2 mu m feature strength and their alignment with the outflow from the central star as evidence of dust processing and rapid PAH formation via grain-grain collisions in the post-shock environment of the dense (n(H) similar to 10(5) cm(-3)) photo-dissociation region and molecular envelope.

In Paper I, we present a sample of 336 24 mu m selected (Ultra) Luminous Infrared Galaxies, (U) LIRGs, at z similar to 0.3-2.8, where we focus on determining the AGN contribution to the IR luminosity. Here, we use hydrodynamic simulations with dust radiative transfer of isolated and merging galaxies to investigate how well the simulations reproduce our empirical IR AGN fraction estimates and determine how IR AGN fractions relate to the UV-mm AGN fraction. We find that: (1) IR AGN fraction estimates based on simulations are in qualitative agreement with the empirical values when host reprocessing of the AGN light is considered; (2) for star-forming galaxy (SFG)AGN composites our empirical methods may be underestimating the role of AGN, as our simulations imply >50% AGN fractions, similar to 3 x higher than previous estimates; (3) 6% of our empirically classified SFGs have AGN fractions greater than or similar to 50%. While this is a small percentage of SFGs, if confirmed it would imply that the true number density of AGNs may be underestimated; (4) this comparison depends on the adopted AGN template-those that neglect the contribution of warm dust lower the empirical fractions by up to two times; and (5) the IR AGN fraction is only a good proxy for the intrinsic UV-mm AGN fraction when the extinction is high (A(V) greater than or similar to 1 or up to and including coalescence in a merger).

DERIVING THE PROPERTIES OF CORONAL PRESSURE FRONTS IN 3D: APPLICATION TO THE 2012 MAY 17 GROUND LEVEL ENHANCEMENT	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						shock waves; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: particle emission	HELIOSPHERIC PLASMA SHEETS; MASS-EJECTION; PARTICLE-ACCELERATION; MAGNETIC-FIELD; SOLAR CORONA; WHITE-LIGHT; DRIVEN; MODEL; SUN; SHOCKS	We study the link between an expanding coronal shock and the energetic particles measured near Earth during the ground level enhancement of 2012 May 17. We developed a new technique based on multipoint imaging to triangulate the three-dimensional (3D) expansion of the shock forming in the corona. It uses images from three vantage points by mapping the outermost extent of the coronal region perturbed by the pressure front. We derive for the first time the 3D velocity vector and the distribution of Mach numbers, M-FM, of the entire front as a function of time. Our approach uses magnetic field reconstructions of the coronal field, full magnetohydrodynamic simulations and imaging inversion techniques. We find that the highest M-FM values appear near the coronal neutral line within a few minutes of the coronal mass ejection onset; this neutral line is usually associated with the source of the heliospheric current and plasma sheet. We illustrate the variability of the shock speed, shock geometry, and Mach number along different modeled magnetic field lines. Despite the level of uncertainty in deriving the shock Mach numbers, all employed reconstruction techniques show that the release time of GeV particles occurs when the coronal shock becomes super-critical (M-FM > 3). Combining in situ measurements with heliospheric imagery, we also demonstrate that magnetic connectivity between the accelerator (the coronal shock of 2012 May 17) and the near-Earth environment is established via a magnetic cloud that erupted from the same active region roughly five days earlier.

We detect multiple molecular species, including hydroxyl (OH (2)Pi(3/2)J = 9/2F= 4 - 4; 5 - 5) in both cores, and. tentatively detect H2O(6(15)-5(23)) at similar to 21.84 GHz in both nuclei, indicating the likely presence of maser emission. The observed frequency range also contains metastable ammonia transitions from (J, K) = (1, 1)-(5, 5), as well as the (9, 9) inversion line; together, they are a well- known thermometer of dense molecular gas. Furthermore, the non- metastable (4, 2) and (10, 9), and possibly the (3, 1), lines are also detected. We apply a standard temperature analysis to Arp 220; however, the analysis is complicated. in that standard local thermal equilibrium (LTE) assumptions do not hold. There are indications that a substantial fraction of ammonia could be in the non- metastable transitions, as opposed to only the metastable ones. Thus, the non- metastable transitions could be essential to constraining the temperature. We compare all of these data to ALMA observations of this source, confirming the outflow previously observed by other tracers in both nuclei.

MACS2135 is also known to multiply lens a z = 2.3 sub-millimeter galaxy near the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), as well as a prominent, triply imaged system at a large radius of similar to 37'' south of the BCG. We use the latest available Hubble imaging to construct an accurate lensing model for this cluster, identifying six new multiply imaged systems with the guidance of our LTM method, so that we have roughly quadrupled the number of lensing constraints. We determine that MACS2135 is among the top lensing clusters known, comparable in size to the Hubble Frontier Fields. For a source at z(s) = 2.32, we find an effective Einstein radius of theta(e) = 27 +/- 3'', enclosing 1.12 +/- 0.16 x 10(14) M circle dot. We make our lens model, including mass and magnification maps, publicly available, in anticipation of searches for high-z galaxies with the James Webb Space Telescope, for which this cluster is a compelling target.

In this Letter, we present the first detections of quasi-periodic microstructure emission from millisecond pulsars (MSPs), from Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of two MSPs at 325 and 610 MHz. Similar to the characteristics of microstructure observed in normal period pulsars, we find that these features are often highly polarized and exhibit quasi-periodic behavior on top of broader subpulse emission, with periods of the order of a few mu s. By measuring their widths and periodicities from single pulse intensity profiles and their autocorrelation functions, we extend the microstructure timescale-rotation period relationship by more than an order of magnitude down to rotation periods similar to 5 ms, and find it to be consistent with the relationship derived earlier for normal pulsars. The similarity of behavior is remarkable, given the significantly different physical properties of MSPs and normal period pulsars, and rules out several previous speculations about the possible different characteristics of microstructure in MSP radio emission. We discuss the possible reasons for the non-detection of these features in previous high time resolution MSP studies along with the physical implications of our results, both in terms of a geometric beam sweeping model and temporal modulation model for micropulse production.

THE ALMA SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY IN THE HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD: SEARCH FOR [C II] LINE AND DUST EMISSION IN 6 < z < 8 GALAXIES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: high-redshift; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: star formation; instrumentation: interferometers; submillimeter: galaxies	STAR-FORMING GALAXIES; SIMILAR-TO 7; HIGH-REDSHIFT GALAXIES; LYMAN-BREAK GALAXIES; SUBMILLIMETER GALAXIES; LUMINOSITY FUNCTION; CONTINUUM; GAS; REIONIZATION; STARBURST	We present a search for [C II] line and dust continuum emission from optical dropout galaxies at z > 6 using ASPECS, our Atacama Large Millimeter submillimeter Array Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra-deep Field (UDF). Our observations, which cover the frequency range of 212-272 GHz, encompass approximately the range of 6 < z < 8 for [C II] line emission and reach a limiting luminosity of L-[C II] similar to (1.6-2.5). x. 10(8) L-circle dot. We identify 14 [C II] line emitting candidates in this redshift range with significances > 4.5 sigma, two of which correspond to blind detections with no optical counterparts. At this significance level, our statistical analysis shows that about 60% of our candidates are expected to be spurious. For one of our blindly selected [C II] line candidates, we tentatively detect the CO(6-5) line in our parallel 3 mm line scan. None of the line candidates are individually detected in the 1.2 mm continuum. A stack of all [C II] candidates results in a tentative detection with S1.2 (mm) = 14 +/- 5 mu Jy. This implies a dust-obscured star-formation rate (SFR) of (3 +/- 1) M-circle dot yr(-1). We find that the two highest-SFR objects have candidate [C II] lines with luminosities that are consistent with the low-redshift L[C II] versus SFR relation. The other candidates have significantly higher [C II] luminosities than expected from their UV-based SFR. At the current sensitivity, it is unclear whether the majority of these sources are intrinsically bright [C II] emitters, or spurious sources. If only one of our line candidates was real (a scenario greatly favored by our statistical analysis), we find a source density for [C II] emitters at 6 < z < 8 that is significantly higher than predicted by current models and some extrapolations from galaxies in the local universe.

THE ALMA SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY IN THE HUBBLE ULTRA DEEP FIELD: CONTINUUM NUMBER COUNTS, RESOLVED 1.2 mm EXTRAGALACTIC BACKGROUND, AND PROPERTIES OF THE FAINTEST DUSTY STAR-FORMING GALAXIES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						galaxies: evolution; galaxies: ISM; galaxies: star formation; galaxies: statistics; instrumentation: interferometers; submillimeter: galaxies	MASS-METALLICITY RELATION; SUBMILLIMETER-SELECTED GALAXIES; CO-TO-H-2 CONVERSION FACTOR; MOLECULAR GAS-RESERVOIRS; AZTEC MILLIMETER SURVEY; GREATER-THAN 2; GOODS-N FIELD; 850 MU-M; HIGH-REDSHIFT; MAIN-SEQUENCE	We present an analysis of a deep (1 sigma = 13 mu Jy) cosmological 1.2 mm continuum map based on ASPECS, the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. In the 1 arcmin(2) covered by ASPECS we detect nine sources at >3.5 sigma significance at 1.2 mm. Our ALMA-selected sample has a median redshift of z = 1.6 +/- 0.4, with only one galaxy detected at z > 2 within the survey area. This value is significantly lower than that found in millimeter samples selected at a higher flux density cut-off and similar frequencies. Most galaxies have specific star formation rates similar to that of main sequence galaxies at the same epoch, and we find median values of stellar mass and star formation rates of 4.0 x 10(10) M circle dot and similar to 40 M circle dot yr(-1), respectively. Using the dust emission as a tracer for the ISM mass, we derive depletion times that are typically longer than 300 Myr, and we find molecular gas fractions ranging from similar to 0.1 to 1.0. As noted by previous studies, these values are lower than using CO-based ISM estimates by a factor similar to 2. The 1\,mm number counts (corrected for fidelity and completeness) are in agreement with previous studies that were typically restricted to brighter sources. With our individual detections only, we recover 55% +/- 4% of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 1.2 mm measured by the Planck satellite, and we recover 80% +/- 7% of this EBL if we include the bright end of the number counts and additional detections from stacking. The stacked contribution is dominated by galaxies at z similar to 1-2, with stellar masses of (1-3) x 10(10) M circle dot. For the first time, we are able to characterize the population of galaxies that dominate the EBL at 1.2 mm.

Given the depth and area of ASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies, extrapolating the Meurer z similar to 0 IRX-beta relation to z >= 2 (assuming dust temperature T-d similar to 35 K). However, only six tentative detections are found at z greater than or similar to 2 in ASPECS, with just three at > 3s. Subdividing our z = 2-10 galaxy samples according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and UV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we find a significant detection only in the most massive (>10(9.75) M-circle dot) subsample, with an infrared excess (IRX = L-IR/L-UV) consistent with previous z similar to 2 results. However, the infrared excess we measure from our large selection of sub-L* (< 10(9.75) M-circle dot) galaxies is 0.11(-0.42)(+0.32) +/- 0.34 (bootstrap and formal uncertainties) and 0.14(-0.14)(+0.15) +/- 0.18 at z = 2-3 and z = 4-10, respectively, lying below even an IRX-beta relation for the Small Magellanic Cloud (95% confidence). These results demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR luminosity of z greater than or similar to 2 galaxies. We find that the evolution of the IRX-stellar mass relationship depends on the evolution of the dust temperature. If the dust temperature increases monotonically with redshift (alpha(1 + z)(0.32)) such that T-d similar to 44-50 K at z >= 4, current results are suggestive of little evolution in this relationship to z similar to 6. We use these results to revisit recent estimates of the z >= 3 star formation rate density.

ASSOCIATION OF He-3-RICH SOLAR ENERGETIC PARTICLES WITH LARGE-SCALE CORONAL WAVES	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						acceleration of particles; shock waves; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: flares; Sun: particle emission; waves	MAGNETIC-FIELD CONNECTION; ELECTRON EVENTS; ISOTOPE SPECTROMETER; MASS EJECTIONS; ALPHA MONITOR; EUV WAVES; ACCELERATION; PLASMA; STEREO; PROTON	Small, He-3-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been commonly associated with extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets and narrow coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are believed to be the signatures of magnetic reconnection, involving field lines open to interplanetary space. The elemental and isotopic fractionation in these events are thought to be caused by processes confined to the flare sites. In this study, we identify 32 He-3-rich SEP events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer, near the Earth, during the solar minimum period 2007-2010, and we examine their solar sources with the high resolution Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUV images. Leading the Earth, STEREO-A has provided, for the first time, a direct view on He-3-rich flares, which are generally located on the Sun's western hemisphere. Surprisingly, we find that about half of the He-3-rich SEP events in this survey are associated with large-scale EUV coronal waves. An examination of the wave front propagation, the source-flare distribution, and the coronal magnetic field connections suggests that the EUV waves may affect the injection of He-3-rich SEPs into interplanetary space.

Here, we describe a search for radio transients in the Galactic center, using over 200 hr of archival data from the Very Large Array at 5. and. 8.4 GHz. Every observation of Sgr. A* from 1985 to 2005 has been searched using an automated processing and detection pipeline sensitive to transients with timescales between 30 s and 5 minutes with a typical detection threshold of similar to 100 mJy. Eight possible candidates pass tests to filter false-positives from radio-frequency interference, calibration errors, and imaging artifacts. Two events are identified as promising candidates based on the smoothness of their light curves. Despite the high quality of their light curves, these detections remain suspect due to evidence of incomplete subtraction of the complex structure in the Galactic center, and apparent contingency of one detection on reduction routines. Events of this intensity (similar to 100 mJy) and duration (similar to 100 s) are not obviously associated with known astrophysical sources, and no counterparts are found in data at other wavelengths. We consider potential sources, including Galactic center pulsars, dwarf stars, sources like GCRT. J1745-3009, and bursts from X-ray binaries. None can fully explain the observed transients, suggesting either a new astrophysical source or a subtle imaging artifact. More sensitive multiwavelength studies are necessary to characterize these events, which, if real, occur with a rate of 14(-12)(+32) hr(-1)deg(-2) in the Galactic center.

Of a total of 1302 galaxies in the field, 56 have spectroscopic redshifts and correspondingly well-defined physical properties. Among these, 11 have infrared luminosities L-IR > 10(11) L-circle dot, i.e., a detection in CO emission was expected. Out of these, 7 are detected at various significance in CO, and 4 are undetected in CO emission. In the CO-detected sources, we find CO excitation conditions that are lower than those typically found in starburst/sub-mm galaxy/QSO environments. We use the CO luminosities (including limits for non-detections) to derive molecular gas masses. We discuss our findings in the context of previous molecular gas observations at high redshift (star formation law, gas depletion times, gas fractions): the CO-detected galaxies in the UDF tend to reside on the low-L-IR envelope of the scatter in the L-IR-L'(CO) relation, but exceptions exist. For the CO-detected sources, we find an average depletion time of similar to 1 Gyr, with significant scatter. The average molecularto-stellar mass ratio (MH2/M-*) is consistent with earlier measurements of main-sequence galaxies at these redshifts, and again shows large variations among sources. In some cases, we also measure dust continuum emission. On average, the dust-based estimates of the molecular gas are a factor similar to 2-5x smaller than those based on CO. When we account for detections as well as non-detections, we find large diversity in the molecular gas properties of the high-redshift galaxies covered by ASPECS.

This study is based on galaxies that have been selected solely through their CO emission and not through any other property. In all of the redshift bins the ASPECS measurements reach the predicted "knee" of the CO luminosity function (around 5 x 10(9) Kkms(-1) pc(2)). We find clear evidence of an evolution in the CO luminosity function with respect to z similar to 0, with more CO-luminous galaxies present at z similar to 2. The observed galaxies at z similar to 2 also appear more gas-rich than predicted by recent semi-analytical models. The comoving cosmic molecular gas density within galaxies as a function of redshift shows a drop by a factor of 3-10 from z similar to 2 to z similar to 0 (with significant error bars), and possibly a decline at z > 3. This trend is similar to the observed evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. The latter therefore appears to be at least partly driven by the increased availability of molecular gas reservoirs at the peak of cosmic star formation (z similar to 2).

Our overarching goal is to obtain an unbiased census of molecular gas and dust continuum emission in high-redshift (z > 0.5) galaxies. The similar to 1' region covered within the UDF was chosen to overlap with the deepest available imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope. Our ALMA observations consist of full frequency scans in band. 3 (84-115 GHz) and band. 6 (212-272 GHz) at approximately uniform line sensitivity (L'(CO) similar to 2 x 10(9) K km s(-1) pc(2)), and continuum noise levels of 3.8 mu Jy beam(-1) and 12.7 ae Jy beam(-1), respectively. The molecular surveys cover the different rotational transitions of the CO molecule, leading to essentially full redshift coverage. The [C II] emission line is also covered at redshifts 6.0 < z < 8.0. We present a customized algorithm to identify line candidates in the molecular line scans. and quantify our ability to recover artificial sources from our data. Based on whether multiple CO lines are detected, and whether optical spectroscopic redshifts as well as optical counterparts exist, we constrain the most likely line identification. We report 10 (11) CO line candidates in the 3mm (1mm) band, and our statistical analysis shows that < 4 of these (in each band) are likely spurious. Less than one-third. of the total CO flux in the low-J CO line candidates are from sources that are not associated with an optical/NIR counterpart. We also present continuum maps of both the band. 3 and band. 6 observations. The data presented here form the basis of a number of dedicated studies that are presented in subsequent papers.

LIGO Scientific Collaboration; Vigro Collaboration	THE RATE OF BINARY BLACK HOLE MERGERS INFERRED FROM ADVANCED LIGO OBSERVATIONS SURROUNDING GW150914	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS			English	Article						black holes; gravitational waves; stars: massive	RAY BURST SOURCES; ENERGY-DISTRIBUTION; STELLAR EVOLUTION; MODELS; I.	A transient gravitational-wave signal, GW150914, was identified in the twin Advanced LIGO detectors on 2015 September 2015 at 09: 50: 45 UTC. To assess the implications of this discovery, the detectors remained in operation with unchanged configurations over a period of 39 days around the time of the signal. At the detection statistic threshold corresponding to that observed for GW150914, our search of the 16 days of simultaneous two-detector observational data is estimated to have a false-alarm rate (FAR) of <4.9 x 10(-6) yr(-1), yielding a p-value for GW150914 of <2 x 10(-7). Parameter estimation follow-up on this trigger identifies its source as a binary black hole (BBH) merger with component masses (m(1), m(2)) = (36(-4)(+5), 29(-4)(+4))M-circle dot at redshift z = 0.09(-0.04)(+0.03) (median and 90% credible range). Here, we report on the constraints these observations place on the rate of BBH coalescences. Considering only GW150914, assuming that all BBHs in the universe have the same masses and spins as this event, imposing a search FAR threshold of 1 per 100 years, and assuming that the BBH merger rate is constant in the comoving frame, we infer a 90% credible range of merger rates between 2-53 Gpc(-3) yr(-1)(comoving frame). Incorporating all search triggers that pass a much lower threshold while accounting for the uncertainty in the astrophysical origin of each trigger, we estimate a higher rate, ranging from 13-600 Gpc(-3) yr(-1) depending on assumptions about the BBH mass distribution. All together, our various rate estimates fall in the conservative range 2-600 Gpc(-3) yr(-1).	[Abbott, B. P.; Abbott, R.; Abernathy, M. R.; Adhikari, R. X.; Anderson, S. B.; Arai, K.; Araya, M.

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric dynamics, detecting its global acoustic oscillations, and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present the first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements. Beyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see a star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which consists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude nu(max) and the mean frequency separation between mode overtones Delta nu, is surprising as the nu(max) measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the accepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu(max,circle dot) = 3100 mu Hz, the asteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear larger by 13.8 +/- 5.8% and 4.3 +/- 1.9%, respectively. The higher nu(max) is caused by a combination of the value of nu(max,circle dot), being larger at the time of observations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10 mu Hz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being 10 times larger than VIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), we model 10 overtones for degrees l = 0, 1, 2. We compare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON velocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes mostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few peaks with the lowest S/N.

CMS Collaboration	Measurement of the ZZ production cross section and Z -> l(+)l(-)l '(+)l '(-) branching fraction in pp collisions at root s=13TeV	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						CMS; Physics; Electroweak		Four-lepton production in proton-proton collisions, pp -> (Z/gamma*)(Z/gamma*)-> l(+)l(-)l '(+)l '(-), where l,l '(-) = e or mu, is studied at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.6fb(-1). The ZZ production cross section, sigma(pp -> ZZ) = 14.6(-1.8)(+1.9)(stat)(-0.3)(+0.5) (syst) +/-0.2 (theo) +/-0.4 (lumi) pb, is measured for events with two opposite-sign, sameflavor lepton pairs produced in the mass region 60 < m(l+l-) m (l'+l'-) < 120GeV. The Z boson branching fraction to four leptons is measured to be B(Z -> l(+)l(-)l '(+)l '(-)) = 4.9(-0.7)(+0.8)(stat)(-0.2)(+0.3)(syst)(-0.1)(+0.2)(theo) +/- 0.1 (lumi) x10(-6) for the four-lepton invariant mass in the range 80 < m(l+)l-l'+l' < 100GeVand dilepton mass m(l+l-) > 4GeVfor all opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The results are in agreement with standard model predictions. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier B. V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

CMS Collaboration	Search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson to e tau and e mu in proton-proton collisions at root s=8 TeV	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						CMS; Physics; Higgs; Lepton-flavour-violation		A direct search for lepton flavour violating decays of the Higgs boson (H) in the H. etand H. e mu channels is described. The data sample used in the search was collected in proton-proton collisions at root s= 8 TeVwith the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb(-1). No evidence is found for lepton flavour violating decays in either final state. Upper limits on the branching fractions, B(H. et) < 0.69% and B(H. e mu) < 0.035%, are set at the 95% confidence level. The constraint set on B(H. et) is an order of magnitude more stringent than the existing indirect limits. The limits are used to constrain the corresponding flavour violating Yukawa couplings, absent in the standard model. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Khachatryan, V.; Sirunyan, A.

Harmonisation and diagnostics of MIPAS ESA CH4 and N2O profiles using data assimilation	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; CHEMICAL OBSERVATIONS; 4D-VAR ASSIMILATION; NITROUS-OXIDE; METHANE; VALIDATION; MODEL; REANALYSIS; SYSTEM; TRACER	This paper discusses assimilation experiments of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) profiles retrieved from the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). Here we focus on data versions 6 and 7 provided by the ESA processor. These data sets have been assimilated by the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE). The CH4 and N2O retrieved profiles can oscillate, especially in the tropical lower stratosphere. Using the averaging kernels of the observations and a background error covariance matrix, which has previously been calibrated, allows the system to partly remedy this issue and provide assimilated fields that are more regular vertically. In general, there is a good agreement between the BASCOE analyses and independent observations from ACE-FTS (CH4 and N2O) and MLS (N2O), demonstrating the general good quality of CH4 and N2O retrievals provided by MIPAS ESA. Nevertheless, this study also identifies two issues in these data sets. First, time series of the observations show unexpected discontinuities due to an abrupt change in the gain of MIPAS band B, generally occurring after the instrument decontamination. Since the calibration is performed weekly, the abrupt change in the gain affects the measurements until the subsequent calibration is performed. Second, the correlations between BASCOE analyses and independent observations are poor in the lower stratosphere, especially in the tropics, probably due to the presence of outliers in the assimilated data. In this region, we recommend using MIPAS CH4 and N2O retrievals with caution.

We show that Higgs decays to four leptons are sensitive, via tree level or one-loop interference effects, to both the magnitude and, in particular, overall sign of lambda(WZ). Determining this sign requires interference effects, as it is nearly impossible to measure with rate information. Furthermore, simply determining the sign effectively establishes the custodial representation of the Higgs boson. We find that h -> 4l (4l = 2e2 mu, 4e, 4 mu) decays have excellent prospects of directly establishing the overall sign at a high luminosity 13 TeV LHC. We also examine the ultimate LHC sensitivity in h -> 4l to the magnitude of lambda(WZ). Our results are independent of other measurements of the Higgs boson couplings and, in particular, largely free of assumptions about the top quark Yukawa couplings which also enter at one loop. This makes h -> 4l a unique and independent probe of electroweak symmetry breaking and custodial symmetry.
